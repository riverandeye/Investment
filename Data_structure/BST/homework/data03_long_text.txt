the old testament of the king james version of the bible
the first book of moses  called genesis
in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth
and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon
the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the
waters
and god said let there be light and there was light
and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light
from the darkness
and god called the light day and the darkness he called night
and the evening and the morning were the first day
and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters
and let it divide the waters from the waters
and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were
under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament
and it was so
and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the
morning were the second day
and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so
and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of
the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good
and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding
seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is
in itself upon the earth and it was so
and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after
his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after
his kind and god saw that it was good
and the evening and the morning were the third day
and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for
seasons and for days and years  and let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was
so
and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day
and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also
and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
upon the earth  and to rule over the day and over the night and
to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good
and the evening and the morning were the fourth day
and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven
and god created great whales and every living creature that
moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind
and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good
and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill
the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth
and the evening and the morning were the fifth day
and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after
his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his
kind and it was so
and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle
after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after
his kind and god saw that it was good
and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl
of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth
so god created man in his own image in the image of god created
he him male and female created he them
and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and
multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion
over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth
and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed
which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat
and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is
life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so
and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was
very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day
thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of
them
and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and
he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made
and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that
in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the
heavens  and every plant of the field before it was in the earth
and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not
caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the
ground
but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole
face of the ground
and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living
soul
and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he
put the man whom he had formed
and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is
pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the
midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil
and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence
it was parted and became into four heads
the name of the first is pison that is it which compasseth the
whole land of havilah where there is gold  and the gold of that
land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone
and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that
compasseth the whole land of ethiopia
and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is it which
goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates
and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of
eden to dress it and to keep it
and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat  but of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be
alone i will make him an help meet for him
and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the
field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see
what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living
creature that was the name thereof
and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air
and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found an
help meet for him
and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he
slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead
thereof  and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made
he a woman and brought her unto the man
and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my
flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall
cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not
ashamed
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which
the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said
ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden   and the woman said
unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden
god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest
ye die
and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall
be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that
it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one
wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto
her husband with her and he did eat
and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they
were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves
aprons
and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in
the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden
and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art
thou   and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was
afraid because i was naked and i hid myself
and he said who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten
of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat
and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she
gave me of the tree and i did eat
and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast
done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat
and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done
this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the
field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life  and i will put enmity between thee and the
woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head
and thou shalt bruise his heel
unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy
desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee
and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee
saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life  thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the
herb of the field  in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for
dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return
and adam called his wifes name eve because she was the mother
of all living
unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of
skins and clothed them
and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to
know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also
of the tree of life and eat and live for ever  therefore the
lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground
from whence he was taken
so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden
of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep
the way of the tree of life
and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and
said i have gotten a man from the lord
and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of
sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground
and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord
and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his
offering  but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect
and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell
and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy
countenance fallen   if thou doest well shalt thou not be
accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto
thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him
and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when
they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother
and slew him
and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he
said i know not am i my brothers keeper   and he said what
hast thou done the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from
the ground
and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand  when thou
tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her
strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth
and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can
bear
behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and
a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one
that findeth me shall slay me
and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain
vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark
upon cain lest any finding him should kill him
and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the
land of nod on the east of eden
and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and he
builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his
son enoch
and unto enoch was born irad and irad begat mehujael and
mehujael begat methusael and methusael begat lamech
and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was adah
and the name of the other zillah
and adah bare jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents
and of such as have cattle
and his brothers name was jubal he was the father of all such
as handle the harp and organ
and zillah she also bare tubalcain an instructer of every
artificer in brass and iron and the sister of tubalcain was naamah
and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice
ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man to
my wounding and a young man to my hurt
if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and
sevenfold
and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his
name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead
of abel whom cain slew
and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his
name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord
this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god
created man in the likeness of god made he him  male and female
created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the
day when they were created
and adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his
own likeness and after his image and called his name seth  and
the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years
and he begat sons and daughters  and all the days that adam lived
were nine hundred and thirty years and he died
and seth lived an hundred and five years and begat enos  and
seth lived after he begat enos eight hundred and seven years and
begat sons and daughters  and all the days of seth were nine
hundred and twelve years and he died
and enos lived ninety years and begat cainan  and enos lived
after he begat cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons
and daughters  and all the days of enos were nine hundred and
five years and he died
and cainan lived seventy years and begat mahalaleel  and
cainan lived after he begat mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years
and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of cainan were
nine hundred and ten years and he died
and mahalaleel lived sixty and five years and begat jared
and mahalaleel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty
years and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of
mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he died
and jared lived an hundred sixty and two years and he begat
enoch  and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years
and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of jared were nine
hundred sixty and two years and he died
and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah
and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred
years and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of enoch
were three hundred sixty and five years  and enoch walked with
god and he was not for god took him
and methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years and begat
lamech
and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty
and two years and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of
methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died
and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begat a
son  and he called his name noah saying this same shall comfort
us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground
which the lord hath cursed
and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five
years and begat sons and daughters  and all the days of lamech
were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died
and noah was five hundred years old and noah begat shem ham
and japheth
and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the
earth and daughters were born unto them  that the sons of god saw
the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of
all which they chose
and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for
that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty
years
there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that
when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare
children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of
renown
and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually
and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it
grieved him at his heart
and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the
face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and
the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them
but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord
these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect
in his generations and noah walked with god
and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth
the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled
with violence
and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for
all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth
and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me
for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i
will destroy them with the earth
make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the
ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the length
of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty
cubits and the height of it thirty cubits
a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou
finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it
and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the
earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under
heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die
but with thee will i establish my covenant and thou shalt come
into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives
with thee
and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt
thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be
male and female
of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of
every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort
shall come unto thee to keep them alive
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt
gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them
thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did
he
and the lord said unto noah come thou and all thy house into the
ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male
and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and
his female
of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to
keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth
for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth
forty days and forty nights and every living substance that i have
made will i destroy from off the face of the earth
and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him
and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was
upon the earth
and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives
with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood
of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls
and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth  there went in two
and two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god had
commanded noah
and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the
flood were upon the earth
in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second month
the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains
of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened
and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights
in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth
the sons of noah and noahs wife and the three wives of his sons
with them into the ark  they and every beast after his kind
and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind
every bird of every sort
and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all
flesh wherein is the breath of life
and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as
god had commanded him and the lord shut him in
and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters
increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth
and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the
earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the
high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains
were covered
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and
of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth
upon the earth and every man  all in whose nostrils was the
breath of life of all that was in the dry land died
and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face
of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the
fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noah
only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark
and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
days
and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the
cattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over
the earth and the waters asswaged  the fountains also of the deep
and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was
restrained  and the waters returned from off the earth
continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the
waters were abated
and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of
the month upon the mountains of ararat
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the
tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the
mountains seen
and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the
window of the ark which he had made  and he sent forth a raven
which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off
the earth
also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were
abated from off the face of the ground  but the dove found no rest
for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for
the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his
hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark
and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the
dove out of the ark  and the dove came in to him in the evening
and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so noah knew that
the waters were abated from off the earth
and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove
which returned not again unto him any more
and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the
first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from
off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked
and behold the face of the ground was dry
and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the
month was the earth dried
and god spake unto noah saying  go forth of the ark thou
and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of
all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the
earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth
and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons
wives with him  every beast every creeping thing and every
fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went
forth out of the ark
and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean
beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the
altar
and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his
heart i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake for
the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither will i
again smite any more every thing living as i have done
while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and
heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease
and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be
fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast
of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth
upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are
they delivered
every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the
green herb have i given you all things
but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall
ye not eat
and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of
every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of
every mans brother will i require the life of man
whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in
the image of god made he man
and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in
the earth and multiply therein
and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying  and
i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after
you  and with every living creature that is with you of the
fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from
all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth
and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all
flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall
there any more be a flood to destroy the earth
and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make
between me and you and every living creature that is with you for
perpetual generations  i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall
be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth
and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth
that the bow shall be seen in the cloud  and i will remember my
covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all
flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all
flesh
and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that
i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth
and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which
i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth
and the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were shem and
ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan
these are the three sons of noah and of them was the whole earth
overspread
and noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard
and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered
within his tent
and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father
and told his two brethren without
and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their
shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their
father and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers
nakedness
and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had
done unto him
and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be
unto his brethren
and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall be
his servant
god shall enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of
shem and canaan shall be his servant
and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years
and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and
he died
now these are the generations of the sons of noah shem ham and
japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood
the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and
tubal and meshech and tiras
and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah
and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish kittim and
dodanim
by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands
every one after his tongue after their families in their nations
and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and phut and canaan
and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah
and sabtechah and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan
and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth
he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said
even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord
and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and
accad and calneh in the land of shinar
out of that land went forth asshur and builded nineveh and the
city rehoboth and calah  and resen between nineveh and calah
the same is a great city
and mizraim begat ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim
and pathrusim and casluhim out of whom came philistim and
caphtorim
and canaan begat sidon his first born and heth  and the
jebusite and the amorite and the girgasite  and the hivite
and the arkite and the sinite  and the arvadite and the
zemarite and the hamathite and afterward were the families of the
canaanites spread abroad
and the border of the canaanites was from sidon as thou comest
to gerar unto gaza as thou goest unto sodom and gomorrah and
admah and zeboim even unto lasha
these are the sons of ham after their families after their
tongues in their countries and in their nations
unto shem also the father of all the children of eber the
brother of japheth the elder even to him were children born
the children of shem elam and asshur and arphaxad and lud
and aram
and the children of aram uz and hul and gether and mash
and arphaxad begat salah and salah begat eber
and unto eber were born two sons the name of one was peleg for
in his days was the earth divided and his brothers name was joktan
and joktan begat almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and
jerah  and hadoram and uzal and diklah  and obal and
abimael and sheba  and ophir and havilah and jobab all these
were the sons of joktan
and their dwelling was from mesha as thou goest unto sephar a
mount of the east
these are the sons of shem after their families after their
tongues in their lands after their nations
these are the families of the sons of noah after their
generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided
in the earth after the flood
and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech
and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they
found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there
and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn
them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for
morter
and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose
top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth
and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the
children of men builded
and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all
one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be
restrained from them which they have imagined to do
go to let us go down and there confound their language that
they may not understand one anothers speech
so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
all the earth and they left off to build the city
therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did
there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the
lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth
these are the generations of shem shem was an hundred years
old and begat arphaxad two years after the flood  and shem
lived after he begat arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and

now these are the generations of terah terah begat abram

and haran died before his father terah in the land of his
nativity in ur of the chaldees
and abram and nahor took them wives the name of abrams wife
was sarai and the name of nahors wife milcah the daughter of
haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah
but sarai was barren she had no child
and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his sons
son and sarai his daughter in law his son abrams wife and they
went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of
canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there
and the days of terah were two hundred and five years and terah
died in haran
now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country
and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house unto a land that i
will shew thee  and i will make of thee a great nation and i
will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a
blessing  and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him
that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be
blessed
so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went
with him and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed
out of haran
and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brothers son and all
their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had
gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan
and into the land of canaan they came
and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem unto
the plain of moreh and the canaanite was then in the land
and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i
give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who
appeared unto him
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel
and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and hai on the east
and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name
of the lord
and abram journeyed going on still toward the south
and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into
egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land
and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt
that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art a
fair woman to look upon  therefore it shall come to pass when
the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife
and they will kill me but they will save thee alive
say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with
me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee
and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the
egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair
the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before
pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaohs house
and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep and
oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses
and camels
and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues
because of sarai abrams wife
and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast
done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife
why saidst thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me to
wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way
and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him
away and his wife and all that he had
and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he
had and lot with him into the south
and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold
and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto
the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and
hai  unto the place of the altar which he had make there at the
first and there abram called on the name of the lord
and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and
tents
and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell
together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell
together
and there was a strife between the herdmen of abrams cattle and
the herdmen of lots cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite
dwelled then in the land
and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee
between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be
brethren
is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee
from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right
or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left
and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan
that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom
and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt
as thou comest unto zoar
then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed
east and they separated themselves the one from the other
abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the
cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom
but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord
exceedingly
and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from
him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art
northward and southward and eastward and westward  for all
the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for
ever
and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a
man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be
numbered
arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the
breadth of it for i will give it unto thee
then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of
mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord
and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar
arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of
nations  that these made war with bera king of sodom and with
birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of
zeboiim and the king of bela which is zoar
all these were joined together in the vale of siddim which is
the salt sea
twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year
they rebelled
and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that
were with him and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim and the
zuzims in ham and the emins in shaveh kiriathaim  and the
horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness
and they returned and came to enmishpat which is kadesh and
smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that
dwelt in hazezontamar
and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah
and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela
the same is zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale of
siddim  with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal king
of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar
four kings with five
and the vale of siddim was full of slimepits and the kings of
sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled
to the mountain
and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their
victuals and went their way
and they took lot abrams brothers son who dwelt in sodom
and his goods and departed
and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew
for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and
brother of aner and these were confederate with abram
and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he
armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and
eighteen and pursued them unto dan
and he divided himself against them he and his servants by
night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the
left hand of damascus
and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his
brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people
and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from
the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at
the valley of shaveh which is the kings dale
and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and
he was the priest of the most high god
and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high
god possessor of heaven and earth  and blessed be the most high
god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him
tithes of all
and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and
take the goods to thyself
and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand
unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth
that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and
that i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say
i have made abram rich  save only that which the young men have
eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol
and mamre let them take their portion
after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a
vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding
great reward
and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go
childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus
and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo
one born in my house is mine heir
and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this
shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own
bowels shall be thine heir
and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward
heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he
said unto him so shall thy seed be
and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for
righteousness
and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur
of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it
and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit
it   and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old
and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a
turtledove and a young pigeon
and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst
and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not
and when the fowls came down upon the carcases abram drove them
away
and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram
and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him
and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be
a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and
they shall afflict them four hundred years  and also that
nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they
come out with great substance
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried
in a good old age
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for
the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full
and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was
dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between
those pieces
in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying
unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the
great river the river euphrates  the kenites and the
kenizzites and the kadmonites  and the hittites and the
perizzites and the rephaims  and the amorites and the
canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites
now sarai abrams wife bare him no children and she had an
handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar
and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained
me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may
obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai
and sarai abrams wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after
abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her
husband abram to be his wife
and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw
that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes
and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i have given my
maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was
despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee
but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thine hand do
to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her she
fled from her face
and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the
wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur
and he said hagar sarais maid whence camest thou and whither
wilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai
and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress
and submit thyself under her hands
and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy
seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude
and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art with
child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael because
the lord hath heard thy affliction
and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man
and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence
of all his brethren
and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou
god seest me for she said have i also here looked after him that
seeth me   wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold
it is between kadesh and bered
and hagar bare abram a son and abram called his sons name
which hagar bare ishmael
and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bare
ishmael to abram
and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared
to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me
and be thou perfect
and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will
multiply thee exceedingly
and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying
as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a
father of many nations
neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name
shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee
and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations
of thee and kings shall come out of thee
and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a
god unto thee and to thy seed after thee
and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land
wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an
everlasting possession and i will be their god
and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore
thou and thy seed after thee in their generations
this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and
thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall
be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you
and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you
every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or
bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed
he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy
money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your
flesh for an everlasting covenant
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is
not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath
broken my covenant
and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not
call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be
and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i
will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people
shall be of her
then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his
heart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old
and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear   and abraham
said unto god o that ishmael might live before thee   and god
said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call
his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an
everlasting covenant and with his seed after him
and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed
him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly
twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation
but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall
bear unto thee at this set time in the next year
and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham
and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his
house and all that were bought with his money every male among the
men of abrahams house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in
the selfsame day as god had said unto him
and abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin
in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his
son
and all the men of his house born in the house and bought with
money of the stranger were circumcised with him
and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre and he sat
in the tent door in the heat of the day  and he lift up his eyes
and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he
ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the
ground  and said my lord if now i have found favour in thy
sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant  let a little
water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves
under the tree  and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort
ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come
to your servant and they said so do as thou hast said
and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make
ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes
upon the hearth
and abraham ran unto the herd and fetcht a calf tender and good
and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it
and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed
and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they
did eat
and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said
behold in the tent
and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the
time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah
heard it in the tent door which was behind him
now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it
ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women
therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed
old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also   and the lord
said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a
surety bear a child which am old   is any thing too hard for
the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to
the time of life and sarah shall have a son
then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid
and he said nay but thou didst laugh
and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and
abraham went with them to bring them on the way
and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i
do  seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him
for i know him that he will command his children and his
household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do
justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which
he hath spoken of him
and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is
great and because their sin is very grievous  i will go down
now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of
it which is come unto me and if not i will know
and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward
sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord
and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the
righteous with the wicked   peradventure there be fifty
righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the
place for the fifty righteous that are therein   that be far
from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the
wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far
from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right   and
the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city
then i will spare all the place for their sakes
and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me
to speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou
destroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find there
forty and five i will not destroy it
and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure there
shall be forty found there and he said i will not do it for fortys
sake
and he said unto him oh let not the lord be angry and i will
speak peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i
will not do it if i find thirty there
and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the
lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said i
will not destroy it for twentys sake
and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet
but this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i
will not destroy it for tens sake
and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with
abraham and abraham returned unto his place
and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in the
gate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed
himself with his face toward the ground  and he said behold now
my lords turn in i pray you into your servants house and tarry
all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on
your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all
night
and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him
and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake
unleavened bread and they did eat
but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of
sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people
from every quarter  and they called unto lot and said unto him
where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out
unto us that we may know them
and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after
him  and said i pray you brethren do not so wickedly
behold now i have two daughters which have not known man let
me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good
in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they
under the shadow of my roof
and they said stand back and they said again this one fellow
came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal
worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man
even lot and came near to break the door
but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house
to them and shut to the door
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to
find the door
and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides son in
law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the
city bring them out of this place  for we will destroy this
place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the
lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it
and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married
his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord
will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons
in law
and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot
saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city
and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon
the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord
being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him
without the city
and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad
that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay
thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed
and lot said unto them oh not so my lord  behold now
thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy
mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and i cannot
escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die
behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one
oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall
live
and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this
thing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which thou
hast spoken
haste thee escape thither for i cannot do anything till thou
be come thither therefore the name of the city was called zoar
the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar
then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and
fire from the lord out of heaven  and he overthrew those cities
and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that
which grew upon the ground
but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a
pillar of salt
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
stood before the lord  and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah
and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke
of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace
and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain
that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the
overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt
and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his
two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt
in a cave he and his two daughters
and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and
there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of
all the earth  come let us make our father drink wine and we
will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father
and they made their father drink wine that night and the
firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when
she lay down nor when she arose
and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto
the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him
drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we
may preserve seed of our father
and they made their father drink wine that night also and the
younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay
down nor when she arose
thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father
and the first born bare a son and called his name moab the
same is the father of the moabites unto this day
and the younger she also bare a son and called his name
benammi the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this
day
and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and
dwelled between kadesh and shur and sojourned in gerar
and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and
abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah
but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him
behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken
for she is a mans wife
but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord wilt thou
slay also a righteous nation   said he not unto me she is my
sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the
integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this
and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst
this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from
sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her
now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and
he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her
not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are
thine
therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his
servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were
sore afraid
then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou
done unto us and what have i offended thee that thou hast brought on
me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that
ought not to be done
and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou
hast done this thing   and abraham said because i thought
surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for
my wifes sake
and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my
father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife
and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my
fathers house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou
shalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me
he is my brother
and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and
womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his
wife
and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell where
it pleaseth thee
and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a
thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the
eyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she was
reproved
so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his
wife and his maidservants and they bare children
for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
abimelech because of sarah abrahams wife
and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto
sarah as he had spoken
for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at
the set time of which god had spoken to him
and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him
whom sarah bare to him isaac
and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old as
god had commanded him
and abraham was an hundred years old when his son isaac was born
unto him
and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that hear
will laugh with me
and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should
have given children suck for i have born him a son in his old age
and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great
feast the same day that isaac was weaned
and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had born
unto abraham mocking
wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her
son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even
with isaac
and the thing was very grievous in abrahams sight because of
his son
and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight
because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah
hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy
seed be called
and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation
because he is thy seed
and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a
bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder
and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in
the wilderness of beersheba
and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child
under one of the shrubs
and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off
as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the
child and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept
and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called
to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar
fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is
arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for i will
make him a great nation
and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she
went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink
and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the
wilderness and became an archer
and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took him
a wife out of the land of egypt
and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phichol the
chief captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god is with thee
in all that thou doest  now therefore swear unto me here by god
that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my
sons son but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee
thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned
and abraham said i will swear
and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water which
abimelechs servants had violently taken away
and abimelech said i wot not who hath done this thing neither
didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but to day
and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech
and both of them made a covenant
and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves
and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewe lambs
which thou hast set by themselves   and he said for these seven
ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto
me that i have digged this well
wherefore he called that place beersheba because there they
sware both of them
thus they made a covenant at beersheba then abimelech rose up
and phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into the
land of the philistines
and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on
the name of the lord the everlasting god
and abraham sojourned in the philistines land many days
and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt
abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am
and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou
lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for
a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of
and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass
and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave
the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place
of which god had told him
then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
place afar off
and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass
and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you
and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon
isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they
went both of them together
and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and
he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood
but where is the lamb for a burnt offering   and abraham said my
son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they
went both of them together
and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham
built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his
son and laid him on the altar upon the wood
and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay
his son
and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and
said abraham abraham and he said here am i
and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou
any thing unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou
hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me
and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind
him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took
the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his
son
and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh as it is
said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen
and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the
second time  and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord
for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son
thine only son  that in blessing i will bless thee and in
multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and
as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess
the gate of his enemies  and in thy seed shall all the nations
of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice
so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and
went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba
and it came to pass after these things that it was told
abraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thy
brother nahor  huz his firstborn and buz his brother and
kemuel the father of aram  and chesed and hazo and pildash
and jidlaph and bethuel
and bethuel begat rebekah these eight milcah did bear to nahor
abrahams brother
and his concubine whose name was reumah she bare also tebah
and gaham and thahash and maachah
and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these
were the years of the life of sarah
and sarah died in kirjatharba the same is hebron in the land of
canaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her
and abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the
sons of heth saying  i am a stranger and a sojourner with you
give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my
dead out of my sight
and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him
hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of
our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his
sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead
and abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the
land even to the children of heth
and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i
should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to
ephron the son of zohar  that he may give me the cave of
machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as
much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a
buryingplace amongst you
and ephron dwelt among the children of heth and ephron the
hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth even
of all that went in at the gate of his city saying  nay my
lord hear me the field give i thee and the cave that is therein i
give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee
bury thy dead
and abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land
and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the
land saying but if thou wilt give it i pray thee hear me i will
give thee money for the field take it of me and i will bury my dead
there
and ephron answered abraham saying unto him  my lord
hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver
what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead
and abraham hearkened unto ephron and abraham weighed to ephron
the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of heth
four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant
and the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before
mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees
that were in the field that were in all the borders round about were
made sure  unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the
children of heth before all that went in at the gate of his city
and after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the
field of machpelah before mamre the same is hebron in the land of
canaan
and the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto
abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of heth
and abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had
blessed abraham in all things
and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled
over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh
and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god
of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the
daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell  but thou shalt
go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son
isaac
and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be
willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring thy son again
unto the land from whence thou camest   and abraham said unto
him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again
the lord god of heaven which took me from my fathers house and
from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that sware
unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send
his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from
thence
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou
shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his
master and sware to him concerning that matter
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and
departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he
arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nahor
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well
of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out
to draw water
and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send
me good speed this day and shew kindness unto my master abraham
behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of
the men of the city come out to draw water  and let it come to
pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i
pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give
thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed
for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast shewed
kindness unto my master
and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold
rebekah came out who was born to bethuel son of milcah the wife of
nahor abrahams brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder
and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had
any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her
pitcher and came up
and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee
drink a little water of thy pitcher
and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her
pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink
and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw
water for thy camels also until they have done drinking
and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran
again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels
and the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the
lord had made his journey prosperous or not
and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the
man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets
for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold  and said whose
daughter art thou tell me i pray thee is there room in thy fathers
house for us to lodge in   and she said unto him i am the
daughter of bethuel the son of milcah which she bare unto nahor
she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender
enough and room to lodge in
and the man bowed down his head and worshipped the lord
and he said blessed be the lord god of my master abraham who
hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth i being
in the way the lord led me to the house of my masters brethren
and the damsel ran and told them of her mothers house these
things
and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran
out unto the man unto the well
and it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon
his sisters hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister
saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and
behold he stood by the camels at the well
and he said come in thou blessed of the lord wherefore
standest thou without for i have prepared the house and room for the
camels
and the man came into the house and he ungirded his camels and
gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet
and the mens feet that were with him
and there was set meat before him to eat but he said i will
not eat until i have told mine errand and he said speak on
and he said i am abrahams servant
and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become
great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold
and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses
and sarah my masters wife bare a son to my master when she was
old and unto him hath he given all that he hath
and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife
to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell
but thou shalt go unto my fathers house and to my kindred and
take a wife unto my son
and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not
follow me
and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his
angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for
my son of my kindred and of my fathers house  then shalt thou
be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if
they give not thee one thou shalt be clear from my oath
and i came this day unto the well and said o lord god of my
master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go
behold i stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that
when the virgin cometh forth to draw water and i say to her give me
i pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drink  and she say
to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the
same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my masters
son
and before i had done speaking in mine heart behold rebekah
came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto
the well and drew water and i said unto her let me drink i pray
thee
and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder
and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank
and she made the camels drink also
and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she
said the daughter of bethuel nahors son whom milcah bare unto him
and i put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands
and i bowed down my head and worshipped the lord and blessed
the lord god of my master abraham which had led me in the right way
to take my masters brothers daughter unto his son
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell
me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the
left
then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth
from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good
behold rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be
thy masters sons wife as the lord hath spoken
and it came to pass that when abrahams servant heard their
words he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of
gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to her
brother and to her mother precious things
and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him
and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said
send me away unto my master
and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with
us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go
and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath
prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master
and they said we will call the damsel and enquire at her
mouth
and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with
this man and she said i will go
and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and
abrahams servant and his men
and they blessed rebekah and said unto her thou art our
sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed
possess the gate of those which hate them
and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the
camels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and went
his way
and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi for he dwelt
in the south country
and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and
he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming
and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she
lighted off the camel
for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh
in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master
therefore she took a vail and covered herself
and the servant told isaac all things that he had done
and isaac brought her into his mother sarahs tent and took
rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was
comforted after his mothers death
then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah
and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and
ishbak and shuah
and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were
asshurim and letushim and leummim
and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abidah
and eldaah all these were the children of keturah
and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac
but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham had abraham
gave gifts and sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived
eastward unto the east country
and these are the days of the years of abrahams life which he
lived an hundred threescore and fifteen years
then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an
old man and full of years and was gathered to his people
and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of
machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which
is before mamre  the field which abraham purchased of the sons
of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife
and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed
his son isaac and isaac dwelt by the well lahairoi
now these are the generations of ishmael abrahams son whom
hagar the egyptian sarahs handmaid bare unto abraham  and
these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according
to their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebajoth and kedar
and adbeel and mibsam  and mishma and dumah and massa
hadar and tema jetur naphish and kedemah  these are the sons
of ishmael and these are their names by their towns and by their
castles twelve princes according to their nations
and these are the years of the life of ishmael an hundred and
thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and was
gathered unto his people
and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as
thou goest toward assyria and he died in the presence of all his
brethren
and these are the generations of isaac abrahams son abraham
begat isaac  and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah
to wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sister
to laban the syrian
and isaac intreated the lord for his wife because she was
barren and the lord was intreated of him and rebekah his wife
conceived
and the children struggled together within her and she said if
it be so why am i thus and she went to enquire of the lord
and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two
manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one
people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall
serve the younger
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there
were twins in her womb
and the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and
they called his name esau
and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on
esaus heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was threescore
years old when she bare them
and the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the
field and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents
and isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison but
rebekah loved jacob
and jacob sod pottage and esau came from the field and he was
faint  and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that
same red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom
and jacob said sell me this day thy birthright
and esau said behold i am at the point to die and what profit
shall this birthright do to me   and jacob said swear to me
this day and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright unto
jacob
then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did
eat and drink and rose up and went his way thus esau despised his
birthright
and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that
was in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of the
philistines unto gerar
and the lord appeared unto him and said go not down into egypt
dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of  sojourn in this
land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and
unto thy seed i will give all these countries and i will perform the
oath which i sware unto abraham thy father  and i will make thy
seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed
all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the
earth be blessed  because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept
my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws
and isaac dwelt in gerar  and the men of the place asked him
of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say she
is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for
rebekah because she was fair to look upon
and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that
abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw
and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife
and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is
thy wife and how saidst thou she is my sister and isaac said unto
him because i said lest i die for her
and abimelech said what is this thou hast done unto us one of
the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldest
have brought guiltiness upon us
and abimelech charged all his people saying he that toucheth
this man or his wife shall surely be put to death
then isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an
hundredfold and the lord blessed him
and the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he
became very great  for he had possession of flocks and
possession of herds and great store of servants and the philistines
envied him
for all the wells which his fathers servants had digged in the
days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them and
filled them with earth
and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for thou art much
mightier than we
and isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of
gerar and dwelt there
and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged
in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped
them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the
names by which his father had called them
and isaacs servants digged in the valley and found there a
well of springing water
and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaacs herdmen
saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek
because they strove with him
and they digged another well and strove for that also and he
called the name of it sitnah
and he removed from thence and digged another well and for
that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth and he
said for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful
in the land
and he went up from thence to beersheba
and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i am
the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and will
bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abrahams sake
and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the
lord and pitched his tent there and there isaacs servants digged a
well
then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath one of his
friends and phichol the chief captain of his army
and isaac said unto them wherefore come ye to me seeing ye
hate me and have sent me away from you   and they said we saw
certainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there be now
an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a
covenant with thee  that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not
touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have
sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the lord
and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink
and they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to
another and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in
peace
and it came to pass the same day that isaacs servants came
and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto
him we have found water
and he called it shebah therefore the name of the city is
beersheba unto this day
and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the
daughter of beeri the hittite and bashemath the daughter of elon the
hittite  which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah
and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes were
dim so that he could not see he called esau his eldest son and said
unto him my son and he said unto him behold here am i
and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my
death  now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver
and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison
and make me savoury meat such as i love and bring it to me that i
may eat that my soul may bless thee before i die
and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son and esau went
to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it
and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy
father speak unto esau thy brother saying  bring me venison and
make me savoury meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lord
before my death
now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i
command thee
go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of
the goats and i will make them savoury meat for thy father such as
he loveth  and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may
eat and that he may bless thee before his death
and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is
a hairy man and i am a smooth man  my father peradventure will
feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver and i shall bring a
curse upon me and not a blessing
and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only
obey my voice and go fetch me them
and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and
his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved
and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau which
were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands
and upon the smooth of his neck  and she gave the savoury meat
and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob
and he came unto his father and said my father and he said
here am i who art thou my son   and jacob said unto his
father i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badest
me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may
bless me
and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it
so quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god brought it
to me
and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may
feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not
and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and
said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau
and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his
brother esaus hands so he blessed him
and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am
and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my sons
venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him
and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank
and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me
my son
and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of
his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as
the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed  therefore god
give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and
plenty of corn and wine  let people serve thee and nations bow
down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bow
down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he
that blesseth thee
and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of
blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of
isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting
and he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his
father and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his
sons venison that thy soul may bless me
and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said i
am thy son thy firstborn esau
and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who where is he
that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all
before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be
blessed
and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with a
great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me
even me also o my father
and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away
thy blessing
and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hath
supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and
behold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou not
reserved a blessing for me   and isaac answered and said unto
esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i
given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained
him and what shall i do now unto thee my son   and esau said
unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even
me also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept
and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thy
dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven
from above  and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve
thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the
dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck
and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
father blessed him and esau said in his heart the days of mourning
for my father are at hand then will i slay my brother jacob
and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah and
she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him behold
thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to
kill thee
now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee thou to laban
my brother to haran  and tarry with him a few days until thy
brothers fury turn away  until thy brothers anger turn away
from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i will
send and fetch thee from thence why should i be deprived also of you
both in one day   and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my
life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the
daughters of heth such as these which are of the daughters of the
land what good shall my life do me   and isaac called jacob and
blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a
wife of the daughters of canaan
arise go to padanaram to the house of bethuel thy mothers
father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of laban thy
mothers brother
and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply
thee that thou mayest be a multitude of people  and give thee
the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou
mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which god gave
unto abraham
and isaac sent away jacob and he went to padanaram unto laban
son of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebekah jacobs and esaus
mother
when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to
padanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him
he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the
daughers of canaan  and that jacob obeyed his father and his
mother and was gone to padanaram  and esau seeing that the
daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father  then went esau
unto ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalath the
daughter of ishmael abrahams son the sister of nebajoth to be his
wife
and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran
and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all
night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that
place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to
sleep
and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the
top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending
and descending on it
and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord
god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou
liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed  and thy seed
shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the
west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee
and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed
and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places
whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i
will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to
thee of
and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord
is in this place and i knew it not
and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is
none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven
and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that
he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil
upon the top of it
and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of
that city was called luz at the first
and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will
keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and
raiment to put on  so that i come again to my fathers house in
peace then shall the lord be my god  and this stone which i
have set for a pillar shall be gods house and of all that thou
shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee
then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the
people of the east
and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there
were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they
watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the wells mouth
and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the
stone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone
again upon the wells mouth in his place
and jacob said unto them my brethren whence be ye and they
said of haran are we
and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they
said we know him
and he said unto them is he well and they said he is well
and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep
and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the
cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and
feed them
and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gathered
together and till they roll the stone from the wells mouth then we
water the sheep
and while he yet spake with them rachel came with her fathers
sheep for she kept them
and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban
his mothers brother and the sheep of laban his mothers brother
that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth and
watered the flock of laban his mothers brother
and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept
and jacob told rachel that he was her fathers brother and that
he was rebekahs son and she ran and told her father
and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his
sisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed
him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things
and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and
he abode with him the space of a month
and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother
shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy
wages be   and laban had two daughters the name of the elder
was leah and the name of the younger was rachel
leah was tender eyed but rachel was beautiful and well
favoured
and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years
for rachel thy younger daughter
and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that
i should give her to another man abide with me
and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto
him but a few days for the love he had to her
and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are
fulfilled that i may go in unto her
and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a
feast
and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his
daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her
and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for an
handmaid
and it came to pass that in the morning behold it was leah
and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i
serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me
and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give
the younger before the firstborn
fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service
which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years
and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel
his daughter to wife also
and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be
her maid
and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more
than leah and served with him yet seven other years
and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb
but rachel was barren
and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name
reuben for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction
now therefore my husband will love me
and she conceived again and bare a son and said because the
lord hath heard i was hated he hath therefore given me this son also
and she called his name simeon
and she conceived again and bare a son and said now this time
will my husband be joined unto me because i have born him three sons
therefore was his name called levi
and she conceived again and bare a son and she said now will
i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah and left
bearing
and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel
envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i
die
and jacobs anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i
in gods stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb
and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her and she
shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her
and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in
unto her
and bilhah conceived and bare jacob a son
and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my
voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan
and bilhah rachels maid conceived again and bare jacob a second
son
and rachel said with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my
sister and i have prevailed and she called his name naphtali
when leah saw that she had left bearing she took zilpah her
maid and gave her jacob to wife
and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a son
and leah said a troop cometh and she called his name gad
and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a second son
and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me
blessed and she called his name asher
and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found
mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then
rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy sons mandrakes
and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken
my husband and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also and
rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy sons
mandrakes
and jacob came out of the field in the evening and leah went
out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for surely i
have hired thee with my sons mandrakes and he lay with her that
night
and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob
the fifth son
and leah said god hath given me my hire because i have given
my maiden to my husband and she called his name issachar
and leah conceived again and bare jacob the sixth son
and leah said god hath endued me with a good dowry now will my
husband dwell with me because i have born him six sons and she
called his name zebulun
and afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name dinah
and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened
her womb
and she conceived and bare a son and said god hath taken away
my reproach  and she called his name joseph and said the lord
shall add to me another son
and it came to pass when rachel had born joseph that jacob
said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and
to my country
give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee
and let me go for thou knowest my service which i have done thee
and laban said unto him i pray thee if i have found favour in
thine eyes tarry for i have learned by experience that the lord hath
blessed me for thy sake
and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it
and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and
how thy cattle was with me
for it was little which thou hadst before i came and it is now
increased unto a multitude and the lord hath blessed thee since my
coming and now when shall i provide for mine own house also
and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt not
give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again
feed and keep thy flock
i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence
all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among
the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such
shall be my hire
so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it
shall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled
and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be
counted stolen with me
and laban said behold i would it might be according to thy
word
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and
every one that had some white in it and all the brown among the
sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons
and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob and
jacob fed the rest of labans flocks
and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and
chesnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white
appear which was in the rods
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the
gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that
they should conceive when they came to drink
and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth
cattle ringstraked speckled and spotted
and jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the
flocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of
laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto
labans cattle
and it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did
conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in
the gutters that they might conceive among the rods
but when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the
feebler were labans and the stronger jacobs
and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and
maidservants and menservants and camels and asses
and he heard the words of labans sons saying jacob hath taken
away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers
hath he gotten all this glory
and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was
not toward him as before
and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy
fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee
and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his
flock  and said unto them i see your fathers countenance that
it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with
me
and ye know that with all my power i have served your father
and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times
but god suffered him not to hurt me
if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the
cattle bare speckled and if he said thus the ringstraked shall be
thy hire then bare all the cattle ringstraked
thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given
them to me
and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that
i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which
leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisled
and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream saying jacob
and i said here am i
and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which
leap upon the cattle are ringstraked speckled and grisled for i
have seen all that laban doeth unto thee
i am the god of bethel where thou anointedst the pillar and
where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this
land and return unto the land of thy kindred
and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any
portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house   are we not
counted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured
also our money
for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that is
ours and our childrens now then whatsoever god hath said unto
thee do
then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels
and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he
had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in
padanaram for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan
and laban went to shear his sheep and rachel had stolen the
images that were her fathers
and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he
told him not that he fled
so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over
the river and set his face toward the mount gilead
and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled
and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven
days journey and they overtook him in the mount gilead
and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night and said
unto him take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad
then laban overtook jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the
mount and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead
and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast
stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives
taken with the sword   wherefore didst thou flee away secretly
and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent
thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou
hast now done foolishly in so doing
it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of
your father spake unto me yesternight saying take thou heed that
thou speak not to jacob either good or bad
and now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore
longedst after thy fathers house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my
gods   and jacob answered and said to laban because i was
afraid for i said peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy
daughters from me
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before
our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee
for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them
and laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and into
the two maidservants tents but he found them not then went he out
of leahs tent and entered into rachels tent
now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camels
furniture and sat upon them and laban searched all the tent but
found them not
and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i
cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me and he
searched but found not the images
and jacob was wroth and chode with laban and jacob answered
and said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast
so hotly pursued after me   whereas thou hast searched all my
stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here
before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us
both
this twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy she
goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i not
eaten
that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bare
the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by
day or stolen by night
thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by
night and my sleep departed from mine eyes
thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served thee
fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle
and thou hast changed my wages ten times
except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of
isaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty god
hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and rebuked thee
yesternight
and laban answered and said unto jacob these daughters are my
daughters and these children are my children and these cattle are my
cattle and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day
unto these my daughters or unto their children which they have born
now therefore come thou let us make a covenant i and thou and
let it be for a witness between me and thee
and jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar
and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took
stones and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heap
and laban called it jegarsahadutha but jacob called it galeed
and laban said this heap is a witness between me and thee this
day
therefore was the name of it called galeed  and mizpah for he
said the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from
another
if thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take other
wives beside my daughters no man is with us see god is witness
betwixt me and thee
and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold this
pillar which i have cast betwixt me and thee  this heap be
witness and this pillar be witness that i will not pass over this
heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this
pillar unto me for harm
the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their
father judge betwixt us and jacob sware by the fear of his father
isaac
then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his
brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night
in the mount
and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and
his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned unto
his place
and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him
and when jacob saw them he said this is gods host and he
called the name of that place mahanaim
and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the
land of seir the country of edom
and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto my lord
esau thy servant jacob saith thus i have sojourned with laban and
stayed there until now  and i have oxen and asses flocks and
menservants and womenservants and i have sent to tell my lord that
i may find grace in thy sight
and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy
brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men
with him
then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the
people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels
into two bands  and said if esau come to the one company and
smite it then the other company which is left shall escape
and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father
isaac the lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and to
thy kindred and i will deal well with thee  i am not worthy of
the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast
shewed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan
and now i am become two bands
deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the
hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the
mother with the children
and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed
as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude
and he lodged there that same night and took of that which came
to his hand a present for esau his brother  two hundred she
goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams
thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls
twenty she asses and ten foals
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove
by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and
put a space betwixt drove and drove
and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother
meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither
goest thou and whose are these before thee   then thou shalt
say they be thy servant jacobs it is a present sent unto my lord
esau and behold also he is behind us
and so commanded he the second and the third and all that
followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau
when ye find him
and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for
he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and
afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me
so went the present over before him and himself lodged that
night in the company
and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two
womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok
and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over
that he had
and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him
until the breaking of the day
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched
the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was out of
joint as he wrestled with him
and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i
will not let thee go except thou bless me
and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob
and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel
for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast
prevailed
and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name
and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he
blessed him there
and jacob called the name of the place peniel for i have seen
god face to face and my life is preserved
and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he
halted upon his thigh
therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which
shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because
he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh in the sinew that shrank
and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came
and with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leah
and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah
and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost
and he passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground
seven times until he came near to his brother
and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck
and kissed him and they wept
and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children
and said who are those with thee and he said the children which god
hath graciously given thy servant
then the handmaidens came near they and their children and they
bowed themselves
and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves
and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves
and he said what meanest thou by all this drove which i met and
he said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord
and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast
unto thyself
and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace in
thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore i have
seen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wast
pleased with me
take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because
god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and he
urged him and he took it
and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will
go before thee
and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are
tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men
should overdrive them one day all the flock will die
let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i
will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and
the children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir
and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that
are with me and he said what needeth it let me find grace in the
sight of my lord
so esau returned that day on his way unto seir
and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him an house and made
booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called
succoth
and jacob came to shalem a city of shechem which is in the
land of canaan when he came from padanaram and pitched his tent
before the city
and he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent
at the hand of the children of hamor shechems father for an hundred
pieces of money
and he erected there an altar and called it eleloheisrael
and dinah the daughter of leah which she bare unto jacob went
out to see the daughters of the land
and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite prince of the
country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her
and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved
the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel
and shechem spake unto his father hamor saying get me this
damsel to wife
and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter now his
sons were with his cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until
they were come
and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune
with him
and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard it
and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had
wrought folly in israel in lying with jacobs daughter which thing
ought not to be done
and hamor communed with them saying the soul of my son shechem
longeth for your daughter i pray you give her him to wife
and make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto us
and take our daughters unto you
and ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you
dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein
and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me
find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give
ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according
as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife
and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father
deceitfully and said because he had defiled dinah their sister
and they said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our
sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us
but in this will we consent unto you if ye will be as we be
that every male of you be circumcised  then will we give our
daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will
dwell with you and we will become one people
but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will
we take our daughter and we will be gone
and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamors son
and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had
delight in jacobs daughter and he was more honourable than all the
house of his father
and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city
and communed with the men of their city saying  these men are
peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and trade
therein for the land behold it is large enough for them let us
take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our
daughters
only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us
to be one people if every male among us be circumcised as they are
circumcised
shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of
theirs be ours only let us consent unto them and they will dwell
with us
and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went
out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that
went out of the gate of his city
and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore that
two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinahs brethren took each
man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males
and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the
sword and took dinah out of shechems house and went out
the sons of jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city
because they had defiled their sister
they took their sheep and their oxen and their asses and that
which was in the city and that which was in the field  and all
their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they
captive and spoiled even all that was in the house
and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make
me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites
and the perizzites and i being few in number they shall gather
themselves together against me and slay me and i shall be destroyed
i and my house
and they said should he deal with our sister as with an harlot
and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel and dwell there
and make there an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thou
fleddest from the face of esau thy brother
then jacob said unto his household and to all that were with
him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and
change your garments  and let us arise and go up to bethel and
i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my
distress and was with me in the way which i went
and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which were in their
hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and jacob hid
them under the oak which was by shechem
and they journeyed and the terror of god was upon the cities
that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of
jacob
so jacob came to luz which is in the land of canaan that is
bethel he and all the people that were with him
and he built there an altar and called the place elbethel
because there god appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his
brother
but deborah rebekahs nurse died and she was buried beneath
bethel under an oak and the name of it was called allonbachuth
and god appeared unto jacob again when he came out of padanaram
and blessed him
and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be
called any more jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called his
name israel
and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful and
multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and
kings shall come out of thy loins  and the land which i gave
abraham and isaac to thee i will give it and to thy seed after thee
will i give the land
and god went up from him in the place where he talked with him
and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him
even a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon and he
poured oil thereon
and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him
bethel
and they journeyed from bethel and there was but a little way
to come to ephrath and rachel travailed and she had hard labour
and it came to pass when she was in hard labour that the
midwife said unto her fear not thou shalt have this son also
and it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she
died that she called his name benoni but his father called him
benjamin
and rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath which is
bethlehem
and jacob set a pillar upon her grave that is the pillar of
rachels grave unto this day
and israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of
edar
and it came to pass when israel dwelt in that land that reuben
went and lay with bilhah his fathers concubine and israel heard it
now the sons of jacob were twelve  the sons of leah reuben
jacobs firstborn and simeon and levi and judah and issachar and
zebulun  the sons of rachel joseph and benjamin  and the
sons of bilhah rachels handmaid dan and naphtali  and the

the land of canaan
these are the generations of jacob joseph being seventeen years
old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the
sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his fathers wives and
joseph brought unto his father their evil report
now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he
was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours
and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than
all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto
him
and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they
hated him yet the more
and he said unto them hear i pray you this dream which i have
dreamed  for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and
lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves
stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf
and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or
shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the
more for his dreams and for his words
and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and
said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and
the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me
and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his
father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou
hast dreamed  shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to
bow down ourselves to thee to the earth   and his brethren
envied him but his father observed the saying
and his brethren went to feed their fathers flock in shechem
and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock
in shechem come and i will send thee unto them and he said to him
here am i
and he said to him go i pray thee see whether it be well with
thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he
sent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem
and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in
the field and the man asked him saying what seekest thou
and he said i seek my brethren tell me i pray thee where they feed
their flocks
and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them say
let us go to dothan and joseph went after his brethren and found
them in dothan
and when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto
them they conspired against him to slay him
and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh
come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some
pit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall
see what will become of his dreams
and reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands
and said let us not kill him
and reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this
pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might
rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again
and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren
that they stript joseph out of his coat his coat of many colours that
was on him  and they took him and cast him into a pit and the
pit was empty there was no water in it
and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes
and looked and behold a company of ishmeelites came from gilead
with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry
it down to egypt
and judah said unto his brethren what profit is it if we slay
our brother and conceal his blood   come and let us sell him
to the ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our
brother and our flesh and his brethren were content
then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and
lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmeelites
for twenty pieces of silver and they brought joseph into egypt
and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in
the pit and he rent his clothes
and he returned unto his brethren and said the child is not
and i whither shall i go   and they took josephs coat and
killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood  and
they sent the coat of many colours and they brought it to their
father and said this have we found know now whether it be thy sons
coat or no
and he knew it and said it is my sons coat an evil beast
hath devoured him joseph is without doubt rent in pieces
and jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins
and mourned for his son many days
and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him
but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down into
the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him
and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer
of pharaohs and captain of the guard
and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his
brethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name was hirah
and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name
was shuah and he took her and went in unto her
and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er
and she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name
onan
and she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name
shelah and he was at chezib when she bare him
and judah took a wife for er his firstborn whose name was tamar
and er judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord
and the lord slew him
and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brothers wife and
marry her and raise up seed to thy brother
and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to
pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled it on
the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother
and the thing which he did displeased the lord wherefore he
slew him also
then said judah to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow at
thy fathers house till shelah my son be grown for he said lest
peradventure he die also as his brethren did and tamar went and
dwelt in her fathers house
and in process of time the daughter of shuah judahs wife died
and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to
timnath he and his friend hirah the adullamite
and it was told tamar saying behold thy father in law goeth up
to timnath to shear his sheep
and she put her widows garments off from her and covered her
with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is
by the way to timnath for she saw that shelah was grown and she was
not given unto him to wife
when judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because she
had covered her face
and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray thee
let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter
in law and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come
in unto me   and he said i will send thee a kid from the flock
and she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it
and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet
and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it
her and came in unto her and she conceived by him
and she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her and
put on the garments of her widowhood
and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite
to receive his pledge from the womans hand but he found her not
then he asked the men of that place saying where is the
harlot that was openly by the way side and they said there was no
harlot in this place
and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and also
the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place
and judah said let her take it to her lest we be shamed
behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her
and it came to pass about three months after that it was told
judah saying tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot and
also behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring her
forth and let her be burnt
when she was brought forth she sent to her father in law
saying by the man whose these are am i with child and she said
discern i pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets and
staff
and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more
righteous than i because that i gave her not to shelah my son and he
knew her again no more
and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold
twins were in her womb
and it came to pass when she travailed that the one put out
his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet
thread saying this came out first
and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his
brother came out and she said how hast thou broken forth this
breach be upon thee therefore his name was called pharez
and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread
upon his hand and his name was called zarah
and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of
pharaoh captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hands of
the ishmeelites which had brought him down thither
and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he
was in the house of his master the egyptian
and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord
made all that he did to prosper in his hand
and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he
made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his
hand
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer
in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the
egyptians house for josephs sake and the blessing of the lord was
upon all that he had in the house and in the field
and he left all that he had in josephs hand and he knew not
ought he had save the bread which he did eat and joseph was a goodly
person and well favoured
and it came to pass after these things that his masters wife
cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me
but he refused and said unto his masters wife behold my
master wotteth not what is with me in the house and he hath committed
all that he hath to my hand  there is none greater in this house
than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because
thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin
against god   and it came to pass as she spake to joseph day by
day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her
and it came to pass about this time that joseph went into the
house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house
there within
and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he
left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out
and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment
in her hand and was fled forth  that she called unto the men of
her house and spake unto them saying see he hath brought in an
hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and i
cried with a loud voice  and it came to pass when he heard that
i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and
fled and got him out
and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home
and she spake unto him according to these words saying the
hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to
mock me  and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried
that he left his garment with me and fled out
and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his
wife which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thy
servant to me that his wrath was kindled
and josephs master took him and put him into the prison a
place where the kings prisoners were bound and he was there in the
prison
but the lord was with joseph and shewed him mercy and gave him
favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison
and the keeper of the prison committed to josephs hand all the
prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he
was the doer of it
the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under
his hand because the lord was with him and that which he did the
lord made it to prosper
and it came to pass after these things that the butler of the
king of egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of egypt
and pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers against the
chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard
into the prison the place where joseph was bound
and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he
served them and they continued a season in ward
and they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one
night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the
butler and the baker of the king of egypt which were bound in the
prison
and joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon
them and behold they were sad
and he asked pharaohs officers that were with him in the ward of
his lords house saying wherefore look ye so sadly to day   and
they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is no
interpreter of it and joseph said unto them do not interpretations
belong to god tell me them i pray you
and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him
in my dream behold a vine was before me  and in the vine were
three branches and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot
forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes  and
pharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them
into pharaohs cup and i gave the cup into pharaohs hand
and joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it the
three branches are three days  yet within three days shall
pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place and thou
shalt deliver pharaohs cup into his hand after the former manner
when thou wast his butler
but think on me when it shall be well with thee and shew
kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh
and bring me out of this house  for indeed i was stolen away out
of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that
they should put me into the dungeon
when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he
said unto joseph i also was in my dream and behold i had three
white baskets on my head  and in the uppermost basket there was
of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out
of the basket upon my head
and joseph answered and said this is the interpretation
thereof the three baskets are three days  yet within three days
shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a
tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee
and it came to pass the third day which was pharaohs birthday
that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head
of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants
and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and
he gave the cup into pharaohs hand  but he hanged the chief
baker as joseph had interpreted to them
yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgat him
and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh
dreamed and behold he stood by the river
and behold there came up out of the river seven well favoured
kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow
and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the
river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon
the brink of the river
and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
well favoured and fat kine so pharaoh awoke
and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears
of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good
and behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
sprung up after them
and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears
and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled
and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the
wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none
that could interpret them unto pharaoh
then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember
my faults this day  pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put
me in ward in the captain of the guards house both me and the chief
baker  and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed
each man according to the interpretation of his dream
and there was there with us a young man an hebrew servant to
the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us
our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret
and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he
restored unto mine office and him he hanged
then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him
hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his
raiment and came in unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there
is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that thou
canst understand a dream to interpret it
and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shall
give pharaoh an answer of peace
and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon
the bank of the river  and behold there came up out of the
river seven kine fatfleshed and well favoured and they fed in a
meadow  and behold seven other kine came up after them poor
and very ill favoured and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the
land of egypt for badness  and the lean and the ill favoured
kine did eat up the first seven fat kine  and when they had
eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but
they were still ill favoured as at the beginning so i awoke
and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one
stalk full and good  and behold seven ears withered thin
and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them  and the
thin ears devoured the seven good ears and i told this unto the
magicians but there was none that could declare it to me
and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one god
hath shewed pharaoh what he is about to do
the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are
seven years the dream is one
and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them
are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind
shall be seven years of famine
this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is
about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh
behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
the land of egypt  and there shall arise after them seven years
of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt
and the famine shall consume the land  and the plenty shall not
be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall
be very grievous
and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is
because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it
to pass
now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and
set him over the land of egypt
let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land
and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous
years
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come
and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in
the cities
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land
perish not through the famine
and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes
of all his servants
and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as
this is a man in whom the spirit of god is   and pharaoh said
unto joseph forasmuch as god hath shewed thee all this there is none
so discreet and wise as thou art  thou shalt be over my house
and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the
throne will i be greater than thou
and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the
land of egypt
and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon
josephs hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a
gold chain about his neck  and he made him to ride in the second
chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he
made him ruler over all the land of egypt
and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee
shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt
and pharaoh called josephs name zaphnathpaaneah and he gave
him to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on and
joseph went out over all the land of egypt
and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh
king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and
went throughout all the land of egypt
and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
handfuls
and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were
in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of
the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same
and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much
until he left numbering for it was without number
and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
came which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto
him
and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god
said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house
and the name of the second called he ephraim for god hath
caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction
and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of
egypt were ended
and the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph
had said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of
egypt there was bread
and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to
pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto
joseph what he saith to you do
and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph
opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the
famine waxed sore in the land of egypt
and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy corn
because that the famine was so sore in all lands
now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto
his sons why do ye look one upon another   and he said behold
i have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down thither and
buy for us from thence that we may live and not die
and josephs ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt
but benjamin josephs brother jacob sent not with his brethren
for he said lest peradventure mischief befall him
and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those that came
for the famine was in the land of canaan
and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that
sold to all the people of the land and josephs brethren came and
bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth
and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself
strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them
whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food
and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him
and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and
said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are
come
and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy
servants come
we are all one mans sons we are true men thy servants are no
spies
and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land
ye are come
and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one
man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with
our father and one is not
and joseph said unto them that is it that i spake unto you
saying ye are spies  hereby ye shall be proved by the life of
pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come
hither
send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be
kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any
truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies
and he put them all together into ward three days
and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for
i fear god  if ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound
in the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of your
houses  but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your
words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so
and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning
our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought
us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us
and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying
do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore
behold also his blood is required
and they knew not that joseph understood them for he spake unto
them by an interpreter
and he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to
them again and communed with them and took from them simeon and
bound him before their eyes
then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to
restore every mans money into his sack and to give them provision
for the way and thus did he unto them
and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in
the inn he espied his money for behold it was in his sacks mouth
and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo it
is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraid
saying one to another what is this that god hath done unto us
and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and
told him all that befell unto them saying  the man who is the
lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the
country
and we said unto him we are true men we are no spies  we
be twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest
is this day with our father in the land of canaan
and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shall
i know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me
and take food for the famine of your households and be gone
and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are
no spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you your
brother and ye shall traffick in the land
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold
every mans bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and
their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid
and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of my
children joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin
away all these things are against me
and reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if i
bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him
to thee again
and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother
is dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in
the which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to
the grave
and the famine was sore in the land
and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they
had brought out of egypt their father said unto them go again buy
us a little food
and judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protest
unto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be with
you
if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy
thee food  but if thou wilt not send him we will not go down
for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your
brother be with you
and israel said wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell
the man whether ye had yet a brother   and they said the man
asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying is your
father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according
to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would
say bring your brother down   and judah said unto israel his
father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may
live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones
i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if i
bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the
blame for ever  for except we had lingered surely now we had
returned this second time
and their father israel said unto them if it must be so now do
this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry
down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and
myrrh nuts and almonds  and take double money in your hand
and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry
it again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight  take
also your brother and arise go again unto the man  and god
almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your
other brother and benjamin if i be bereaved of my children i am
bereaved
and the men took that present and they took double money in
their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and
stood before joseph
and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the ruler of
his house bring these men home and slay and make ready for these
men shall dine with me at noon
and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into
josephs house
and the men were afraid because they were brought into josephs
house and they said because of the money that was returned in our
sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion
against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses
and they came near to the steward of josephs house and they
communed with him at the door of the house  and said o sir we
came indeed down at the first time to buy food  and it came to
pass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold
every mans money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full
weight and we have brought it again in our hand
and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food
we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks
and he said peace be to you fear not your god and the god of
your father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your money
and he brought simeon out unto them
and the man brought the men into josephs house and gave them
water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender
and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon for
they heard that they should eat bread there
and when joseph came home they brought him the present which
was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the
earth
and he asked them of their welfare and said is your father
well the old man of whom ye spake is he yet alive   and they
answered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive
and they bowed down their heads and made obeisance
and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin his
mothers son and said is this your younger brother of whom ye spake
unto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son
and joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his
brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber
and wept there
and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and
said set on bread
and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves
and for the egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because
the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that is an
abomination unto the egyptians
and they sat before him the firstborn according to his
birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men
marvelled one at another
and he took and sent messes unto them from before him but
benjamins mess was five times so much as any of theirs and they
drank and were merry with him
and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the mens
sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every mans money
in his sacks mouth
and put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of the
youngest and his corn money and he did according to the word that
joseph had spoken
as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they
and their asses
and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off
joseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thou
dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for
good   is not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby
indeed he divineth ye have done evil in so doing
and he overtook them and he spake unto them these same words
and they said unto him wherefore saith my lord these words god
forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing
behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought
again unto thee out of the land of canaan how then should we steal
out of thy lords house silver or gold   with whomsoever of thy
servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lords
bondmen
and he said now also let it be according unto your words he
with whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless
then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground
and opened every man his sack
and he searched and began at the eldest and left at the
youngest and the cup was found in benjamins sack
then they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and
returned to the city
and judah and his brethren came to josephs house for he was
yet there and they fell before him on the ground
and joseph said unto them what deed is this that ye have done
wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine   and judah
said what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak  or how
shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy
servants behold we are my lords servants both we and he also with
whom the cup is found
and he said god forbid that i should do so but the man in
whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you
get you up in peace unto your father
then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy
servant i pray thee speak a word in my lords ears and let not
thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh
my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a
brother   and we said unto my lord we have a father an old
man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is
dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him
and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that
i may set mine eyes upon him
and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father for
if he should leave his father his father would die
and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother
come down with you ye shall see my face no more
and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father
we told him the words of my lord
and our father said go again and buy us a little food
and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with
us then will we go down for we may not see the mans face except
our youngest brother be with us
and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife
bare me two sons  and the one went out from me and i said
surely he is torn in pieces and i saw him not since  and if ye
take this also from me and mischief befall him ye shall bring down
my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad
be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life
it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with
us that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs
of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave
for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father
saying if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to
my father for ever
now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the
lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren
for how shall i go up to my father and the lad be not with me
lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father
then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood
by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there
stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his
brethren
and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh
heard
and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my father
yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were
troubled at his presence
and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you
and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye
sold into egypt
now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye
sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life
for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet
there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor
harvest
and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance
so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath
made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler
throughout all the land of egypt
haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith
thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me
tarry not  and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou
shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens
children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast
and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine
lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty
and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin
that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all
that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither
and he fell upon his brother benjamins neck and wept and
benjamin wept upon his neck
moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and
after that his brethren talked with him
and the fame thereof was heard in pharaohs house saying
josephs brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and his
servants
and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do ye
lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan  and
take your father and your households and come unto me and i will
give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of
the land
now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the
land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your
father and come
also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of
egypt is yours
and the children of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons
according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for
the way
to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to
benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of
raiment
and to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden
with the good things of egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and
bread and meat for his father by the way
so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said
unto them see that ye fall not out by the way
and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan
unto jacob their father  and told him saying joseph is yet
alive and he is governor over all the land of egypt and jacobs
heart fainted for he believed them not
and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said
unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry
him the spirit of jacob their father revived  and israel said
it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before
i die
and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to
beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac
and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night and said
jacob jacob and he said here am i
and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go down
into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation  i will
go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up
again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes
and jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried
jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the
wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him
and they took their cattle and their goods which they had
gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his
seed with him  his sons and his sons sons with him his
daughters and his sons daughters and all his seed brought he with
him into egypt
and these are the names of the children of israel which came
into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacobs firstborn
and the sons of reuben hanoch and phallu and hezron and
carmi
and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin
and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman
and the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari
and the sons of judah er and onan and shelah and pharez and

these be the sons of leah which she bare unto jacob in

the sons of rachel jacobs wife joseph and benjamin
and unto joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and
ephraim which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare

his loins besides jacobs sons wives all the souls were threescore
and six  and the sons of joseph which were born him in egypt
were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob which came into
egypt were threescore and ten
and he sent judah before him unto joseph to direct his face
unto goshen and they came into the land of goshen
and joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel
his father to goshen and presented himself unto him and he fell on
his neck and wept on his neck a good while
and israel said unto joseph now let me die since i have seen
thy face because thou art yet alive
and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his fathers house
i will go up and shew pharaoh and say unto him my brethren and my
fathers house which were in the land of canaan are come unto me
and the men are shepherds for their trade hath been to feed
cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all
that they have
and it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and
shall say what is your occupation   that ye shall say thy
servants trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now
both we and also our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of
goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians
then joseph came and told pharaoh and said my father and my
brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have
are come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land
of goshen
and he took some of his brethren even five men and presented
them unto pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation and
they said unto pharaoh thy servants are shepherds both we and also
our fathers
they said morever unto pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are we
come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the
famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let
thy servants dwell in the land of goshen
and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thy
brethren are come unto thee  the land of egypt is before thee in
the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the
land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity
among them then make them rulers over my cattle
and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before
pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh
and pharaoh said unto jacob how old art thou   and jacob
said unto pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are an
hundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years of
my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the
life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage
and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh
and joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a
possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land
of rameses as pharaoh had commanded
and joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his
fathers household with bread according to their families
and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very
sore so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by
reason of the famine
and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land
of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought
and joseph brought the money into pharaohs house
and when money failed in the land of egypt and in the land of
canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us bread
for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth
and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you for your
cattle if money fail
and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them
bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle
of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all
their cattle for that year
when that year was ended they came unto him the second year
and said unto him we will not hide it from my lord how that our
money is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not
ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands
wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land
buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants
unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die that
the land be not desolate
and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the
egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over
them so the land became pharaohs
and as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of
the borders of egypt even to the other end thereof
only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had
a portion assigned them of pharaoh and did eat their portion which
pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands
then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you this
day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall
sow the land
and it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give
the fifth part unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for
seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households
and for food for your little ones
and they said thou hast saved our lives let us find grace in
the sight of my lord and we will be pharaohs servants
and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this day
that pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of the
priests only which became not pharaohs
and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the country of goshen
and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied
exceedingly
and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the
whole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years
and the time drew nigh that israel must die and he called his
son joseph and said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight
put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly
with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt  but i will lie with
my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their
buryingplace and he said i will do as thou hast said
and he said swear unto me and he sware unto him and israel
bowed himself upon the beds head
and it came to pass after these things that one told joseph
behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons
manasseh and ephraim
and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto
thee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed
and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz
in the land of canaan and blessed me  and said unto me behold
i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee
a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee
for an everlasting possession
and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh which were born unto
thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are
mine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine
and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine
and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their
inheritance
and as for me when i came from padan rachel died by me in the
land of canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come
unto ephrath and i buried her there in the way of ephrath the same
is bethlehem
and israel beheld josephs sons and said who are these
and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath given
me in this place and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i
will bless them
now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could not
see
and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced
them
and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy face
and lo god hath shewed me also thy seed
and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed
himself with his face to the earth
and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward
israels left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israels
right hand and brought them near unto him
and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon
ephraims head who was the younger and his left hand upon manassehs
head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn
and he blessed joseph and said god before whom my fathers
abraham and isaac did walk the god which fed me all my life long unto
this day  the angel which redeemed me from all evil bless the
lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers
abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of
the earth
and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the
head of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his fathers hand
to remove it from ephraims head unto manassehs head
and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is
the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head
and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it
he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly
his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall
become a multitude of nations
and he blessed them that day saying in thee shall israel
bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he set
ephraim before manasseh
and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god shall be
with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers
moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren
which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my
bow
and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves
together that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last
days
gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of jacob and
hearken unto israel your father
reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my
strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power
unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to
thy fathers bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch
simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their
habitations
o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly
mine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man
and in their selfwill they digged down a wall
cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it
was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel
judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall
be in the neck of thine enemies thy fathers children shall bow down
before thee
judah is a lions whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up
he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall
rouse him up   the sceptre shall not depart from judah nor a
lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall
the gathering of the people be
binding his foal unto the vine and his asss colt unto the
choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the
blood of grapes  his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth
white with milk
zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for
an haven of ships and his border shall be unto zidon
issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens
and he saw that rest was good and the land that it was
pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto
tribute
dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of israel
dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that
biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall backward
i have waited for thy salvation o lord
gad a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the
last
out of asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal
dainties
naphtali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words
joseph is a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough by a well
whose branches run over the wall  the archers have sorely
grieved him and shot at him and hated him  but his bow abode
in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands
of the mighty god of jacob from thence is the shepherd the stone of
israel  even by the god of thy father who shall help thee and
by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above
blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breasts and
of the womb  the blessings of thy father have prevailed above
the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the
everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the
crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren
benjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devour
the prey and at night he shall divide the spoil
all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is it that
their father spake unto them and blessed them every one according to
his blessing he blessed them
and he charged them and said unto them i am to be gathered
unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the
field of ephron the hittite  in the cave that is in the field of
machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham
bought with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a
buryingplace
there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried
isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah
the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was
from the children of heth
and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he
gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was
gathered unto his people
and joseph fell upon his fathers face and wept upon him and
kissed him
and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
father and the physicians embalmed israel
and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the
days of those which are embalmed and the egyptians mourned for him
threescore and ten days
and when the days of his mourning were past joseph spake unto
the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found grace in your eyes
speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying  my father made
me swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have digged for me in
the land of canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go
up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again
and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he
made thee swear
and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all
the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders
of the land of egypt  and all the house of joseph and his
brethren and his fathers house only their little ones and their
flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen
and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was
a very great company
and they came to the threshingfloor of atad which is beyond
jordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation
and he made a mourning for his father seven days
and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the
mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning
to the egyptians wherefore the name of it was called abelmizraim
which is beyond jordan
and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them
for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in
the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the
field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite before
mamre
and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all
that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his
father
and when josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they
said joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us
all the evil which we did unto him
and they sent a messenger unto joseph saying thy father did
command before he died saying  so shall ye say unto joseph
forgive i pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin
for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the
trespass of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph wept
when they spake unto him
and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and
they said behold we be thy servants
and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of
god   but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant
it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people
alive
now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little
ones
and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them
and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his fathers house and
joseph lived an hundred and ten years
and joseph saw ephraims children of the third generation the
children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon
josephs knees
and joseph said unto his brethren i die and god will surely
visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware
to abraham to isaac and to jacob
and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god
will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence
so joseph died being an hundred and ten years old and they
embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt
the second book of moses  called exodus
now these are the names of the children of israel which came
into egypt every man and his household came with jacob
reuben simeon levi and judah  issachar zebulun and
benjamin  dan and naphtali gad and asher
and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy
souls for joseph was in egypt already
and joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation
and the children of israel were fruitful and increased
abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land
was filled with them
now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph
and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of
israel are more and mightier than we  come on let us deal wisely
with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there
falleth out any war they join also unto our enemies and fight
against us and so get them up out of the land
therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
their burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities pithom and
raamses
but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and
grew
and they were grieved because of the children of israel
and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with
rigour  and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in
morter and in brick and in all manner of service in the field all
their service wherein they made them serve was with rigour
and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives of which the
name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah  and
he said when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women and
see them upon the stools if it be a son then ye shall kill him but
if it be a daughter then she shall live
but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egypt
commanded them but saved the men children alive
and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said unto
them why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children
alive   and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew
women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are
delivered ere the midwives come in unto them
therefore god dealt well with the midwives and the people
multiplied and waxed very mighty
and it came to pass because the midwives feared god that he
made them houses
and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is
born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save
alive
and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife a
daughter of levi
and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that
he was a goodly child she hid him three months
and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of
bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child
therein and she laid it in the flags by the rivers brink
and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him
and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
river and her maidens walked along by the rivers side and when she
saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it
and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the
babe wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the
hebrews children
then said his sister to pharaohs daughter shall i go and call to
thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for
thee   and pharaohs daughter said to her go and the maid went
and called the childs mother
and pharaohs daughter said unto her take this child away and
nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages and the women took
the child and nursed it
and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaohs daughter
and he became her son and she called his name moses and she said
because i drew him out of the water
and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that he
went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied
an egyptian smiting an hebrew one of his brethren
and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there
was no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand
and when he went out the second day behold two men of the
hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong
wherefore smitest thou thy fellow   and he said who made thee a
prince and a judge over us intendest thou to kill me as thou
killedst the egyptian and moses feared and said surely this thing
is known
now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses but
moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian
and he sat down by a well
now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came and
drew water and filled the troughs to water their fathers flock
and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up
and helped them and watered their flock
and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that
ye are come so soon to day   and they said an egyptian delivered
us out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough for
us and watered the flock
and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that
ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread
and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses
zipporah his daughter
and she bare him a son and he called his name gershom for he
said i have been a stranger in a strange land
and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt
died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and
they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage
and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant
with abraham with isaac and with jacob
and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect
unto them
now moses kept the flock of jethro his father in law the priest
of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and
came to the mountain of god even to horeb
and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned
with fire and the bush was not consumed
and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight
why the bush is not burnt
and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto
him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said
here am i
and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy
feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground
moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham
the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he
was afraid to look upon god
and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people
which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their
taskmasters for i know their sorrows  and i am come down to
deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up
out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing
with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the
hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and
the jebusites
now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come
unto me and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians
oppress them
come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou
mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt
and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh
and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt
and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a
token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth
the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain
and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of
israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me
unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say
unto them   and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said
thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me
unto you
and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the
children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham
the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is
my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations
go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto them
the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of
jacob appeared unto me saying i have surely visited you and seen
that which is done to you in egypt  and i have said i will bring
you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites
and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the
hivites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey
and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou
and the elders of israel unto the king of egypt and ye shall say
unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath met with us and now let us
go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we
may sacrifice to the lord our god
and i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go no not
by a mighty hand
and i will stretch out my hand and smite egypt with all my
wonders which i will do in the midst thereof and after that he will
let you go
and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians
and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour and of her that
sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and
raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your
daughters and ye shall spoil the egyptians
and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe
me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath not
appeared unto thee
and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he
said a rod
and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground
and it became a serpent and moses fled from before it
and the lord said unto moses put forth thine hand and take it by
the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a
rod in his hand  that they may believe that the lord god of their
fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob
hath appeared unto thee
and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into
thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it
out behold his hand was leprous as snow
and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his
hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and
behold it was turned again as his other flesh
and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither
hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the
voice of the latter sign
and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two
signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the
water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which
thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land
and moses said unto the lord o my lord i am not eloquent
neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but i
am slow of speech and of a slow tongue
and the lord said unto him who hath made mans mouth or who
maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not i the
lord   now therefore go and i will be with thy mouth and teach
thee what thou shalt say
and he said o my lord send i pray thee by the hand of him
whom thou wilt send
and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said
is not aaron the levite thy brother i know that he can speak well
and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth
thee he will be glad in his heart
and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and i
will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye
shall do
and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be
even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him
instead of god
and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou shalt
do signs
and moses went and returned to jethro his father in law and said
unto him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethren which
are in egypt and see whether they be yet alive and jethro said to
moses go in peace
and the lord said unto moses in midian go return into egypt
for all the men are dead which sought thy life
and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass
and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in
his hand
and the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return into
egypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i have
put in thine hand but i will harden his heart that he shall not let
the people go
and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is
my son even my firstborn  and i say unto thee let my son go
that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will
slay thy son even thy firstborn
and it came to pass by the way in the inn that the lord met him
and sought to kill him
then zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her
son and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody husband art
thou to me
so he let him go then she said a bloody husband thou art
because of the circumcision
and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses
and he went and met him in the mount of god and kissed him
and moses told aaron all the words of the lord who had sent him
and all the signs which he had commanded him
and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of
the children of israel  and aaron spake all the words which the
lord had spoken unto moses and did the signs in the sight of the
people
and the people believed and when they heard that the lord had
visited the children of israel and that he had looked upon their
affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped
and afterward moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus
saith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a
feast unto me in the wilderness
and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to
let israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go
and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go
we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto
the lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the
sword
and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and
aaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdens
and pharaoh said behold the people of the land now are many and
ye make them rest from their burdens
and pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people
and their officers saying  ye shall no more give the people straw
to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for
themselves
and the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye
shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be
idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god
let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labour
therein and let them not regard vain words
and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers
and they spake to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will not
give you straw
go ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of your
work shall be diminished
so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
egypt to gather stubble instead of straw
and the taskmasters hasted them saying fulfil your works your
daily tasks as when there was straw
and the officers of the children of israel which pharaohs
taskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded wherefore
have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to
day as heretofore   then the officers of the children of israel
came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with
thy servants   there is no straw given unto thy servants and
they say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but
the fault is in thine own people
but he said ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say let us
go and do sacrifice to the lord
go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given
you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks
and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were
in evil case after it was said ye shall not minish ought from your
bricks of your daily task
and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came
forth from pharaoh  and they said unto them the lord look upon
you and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the
eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in
their hand to slay us
and moses returned unto the lord and said lord wherefore hast
thou so evil entreated this people why is it that thou hast sent me
for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done
evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all
then the lord said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will do
to pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a
strong hand shall he drive them out of his land
and god spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord
and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name
of god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known to them
and i have also established my covenant with them to give them
the land of canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were
strangers
and i have also heard the groaning of the children of israel whom
the egyptians keep in bondage and i have remembered my covenant
wherefore say unto the children of israel i am the lord and i
will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i will
rid you out of their bondage and i will redeem you with a stretched
out arm and with great judgments  and i will take you to me for a
people and i will be to you a god and ye shall know that i am the
lord your god which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the
egyptians
and i will bring you in unto the land concerning the which i did
swear to give it to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will give
it you for an heritage i am the lord
and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearkened
not unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage
and the lord spake unto moses saying  go in speak unto
pharaoh king of egypt that he let the children of israel go out of
his land
and moses spake before the lord saying behold the children of
israel have not hearkened unto me how then shall pharaoh hear me who
am of uncircumcised lips   and the lord spake unto moses and unto
aaron and gave them a charge unto the children of israel and unto
pharaoh king of egypt to bring the children of israel out of the land
of egypt
these be the heads of their fathers houses the sons of reuben
the firstborn of israel hanoch and pallu hezron and carmi these
be the families of reuben
and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin
and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman these are the
families of simeon
and these are the names of the sons of levi according to their
generations gershon and kohath and merari and the years of the
life of levi were an hundred thirty and seven years
the sons of gershon libni and shimi according to their
families
and the sons of kohath amram and izhar and hebron and uzziel
and the years of the life of kohath were an hundred thirty and three
years
and the sons of merari mahali and mushi these are the families
of levi according to their generations
and amram took him jochebed his fathers sister to wife and she
bare him aaron and moses and the years of the life of amram were an
hundred and thirty and seven years
and the sons of izhar korah and nepheg and zichri
and the sons of uzziel mishael and elzaphan and zithri
and aaron took him elisheba daughter of amminadab sister of
naashon to wife and she bare him nadab and abihu eleazar and
ithamar
and the sons of korah assir and elkanah and abiasaph these
are the families of the korhites
and eleazar aarons son took him one of the daughters of putiel
to wife and she bare him phinehas these are the heads of the fathers
of the levites according to their families
these are that aaron and moses to whom the lord said bring out
the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their
armies
these are they which spake to pharaoh king of egypt to bring out
the children of israel from egypt these are that moses and aaron
and it came to pass on the day when the lord spake unto moses in
the land of egypt  that the lord spake unto moses saying i am
the lord speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto
thee
and moses said before the lord behold i am of uncircumcised
lips and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me   and the lord said
unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy
brother shall be thy prophet
thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother
shall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out of
his land
and i will harden pharaohs heart and multiply my signs and my
wonders in the land of egypt
but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that i may lay my hand
upon egypt and bring forth mine armies and my people the children of
israel out of the land of egypt by great judgments
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i stretch
forth mine hand upon egypt and bring out the children of israel from
among them
and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them so did they
and moses was fourscore years old and aaron fourscore and three
years old when they spake unto pharaoh
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying  when
pharaoh shall speak unto you saying shew a miracle for you then
thou shalt say unto aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh
and it shall become a serpent
and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the
lord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and
before his servants and it became a serpent
then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the
magicians of egypt they also did in like manner with their
enchantments
for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents
but aarons rod swallowed up their rods
and he hardened pharaohs heart that he hearkened not unto them
as the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses pharaohs heart is hardened he
refuseth to let the people go
get thee unto pharaoh in the morning lo he goeth out unto the
water and thou shalt stand by the rivers brink against he come and
the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand
and thou shalt say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath
sent me unto thee saying let my people go that they may serve me in
the wilderness and behold hitherto thou wouldest not hear
thus saith the lord in this thou shalt know that i am the lord
behold i will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters
which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood
and the fish that is in the river shall die and the river shall
stink and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the
river
and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron take thy rod and
stretch out thine hand upon the waters of egypt upon their streams
upon their rivers and upon their ponds and upon all their pools of
water that they may become blood and that there may be blood
throughout all the land of egypt both in vessels of wood and in
vessels of stone
and moses and aaron did so as the lord commanded and he lifted
up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight
of pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that
were in the river were turned to blood
and the fish that was in the river died and the river stank and
the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river and there was
blood throughout all the land of egypt
and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments and
pharaohs heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as the
lord had said
and pharaoh turned and went into his house neither did he set
his heart to this also
and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to
drink for they could not drink of the water of the river
and seven days were fulfilled after that the lord had smitten
the river
and the lord spake unto moses go unto pharaoh and say unto him
thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me
and if thou refuse to let them go behold i will smite all thy
borders with frogs  and the river shall bring forth frogs
abundantly which shall go up and come into thine house and into thy
bedchamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and
upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneadingtroughs
and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and
upon all thy servants
and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron stretch forth thine
hand with thy rod over the streams over the rivers and over the
ponds and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt
and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the
frogs came up and covered the land of egypt
and the magicians did so with their enchantments and brought up
frogs upon the land of egypt
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said intreat the
lord that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people and
i will let the people go that they may do sacrifice unto the lord
and moses said unto pharaoh glory over me when shall i intreat
for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the
frogs from thee and thy houses that they may remain in the river
only   and he said to morrow and he said be it according to
thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord
our god
and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and
from thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the river
only
and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses cried unto
the lord because of the frogs which he had brought against pharaoh
and the lord did according to the word of moses and the frogs
died out of the houses out of the villages and out of the fields
and they gathered them together upon heaps and the land stank
but when pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened his
heart and hearkened not unto them as the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron stretch out thy
rod and smite the dust of the land that it may become lice
throughout all the land of egypt
and they did so for aaron stretched out his hand with his rod
and smote the dust of the earth and it became lice in man and in
beast all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of
egypt
and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth
lice but they could not so there were lice upon man and upon beast
then the magicians said unto pharaoh this is the finger of god
and pharaohs heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as
the lord had said
and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and
stand before pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say unto
him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me
else if thou wilt not let my people go behold i will send
swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants and upon thy people
and into thy houses and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of
swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are
and i will sever in that day the land of goshen in which my
people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end thou
mayest know that i am the lord in the midst of the earth
and i will put a division between my people and thy people to
morrow shall this sign be
and the lord did so and there came a grievous swarm of flies
into the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and into all
the land of egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of
flies
and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron and said go ye
sacrifice to your god in the land
and moses said it is not meet so to do for we shall sacrifice
the abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god lo shall we
sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes and will
they not stone us   we will go three days journey into the
wilderness and sacrifice to the lord our god as he shall command us
and pharaoh said i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the
lord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away
intreat for me
and moses said behold i go out from thee and i will intreat
the lord that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh from his
servants and from his people to morrow but let not pharaoh deal
deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the
lord
and moses went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord
and the lord did according to the word of moses and he removed
the swarms of flies from pharaoh from his servants and from his
people there remained not one
and pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also neither would
he let the people go
then the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh and tell him
thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they
may serve me
for if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still
behold the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field
upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the oxen and
upon the sheep there shall be a very grievous murrain
and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and the
cattle of egypt and there shall nothing die of all that is the
childrens of israel
and the lord appointed a set time saying to morrow the lord
shall do this thing in the land
and the lord did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of
egypt died but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one
and pharaoh sent and behold there was not one of the cattle of
the israelites dead and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he did
not let the people go
and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron take to you handfuls
of ashes of the furnace and let moses sprinkle it toward the heaven
in the sight of pharaoh
and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt and shall
be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast
throughout all the land of egypt
and they took ashes of the furnace and stood before pharaoh and
moses sprinkled it up toward heaven and it became a boil breaking
forth with blains upon man and upon beast
and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the
boils for the boil was upon the magicians and upon all the
egyptians
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh and he hearkened not
unto them as the lord had spoken unto moses
and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and
stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord god of the
hebrews let my people go that they may serve me
for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and
upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that
there is none like me in all the earth
for now i will stretch out my hand that i may smite thee and thy
people with pestilence and thou shalt be cut off from the earth
and in very deed for this cause have i raised thee up for to
shew in thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all
the earth
as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt
not let them go   behold to morrow about this time i will cause
it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt since
the foundation thereof even until now
send therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast
in the field for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the
field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon
them and they shall die
he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh
made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses  and he
that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his
cattle in the field
and the lord said unto moses stretch forth thine hand toward
heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and
upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of
egypt
and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the lord
sent thunder and hail and the fire ran along upon the ground and the
lord rained hail upon the land of egypt
so there was hail and fire mingled with the hail very grievous
such as there was none like it in all the land of egypt since it
became a nation
and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was
in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the
field and brake every tree of the field
only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were
was there no hail
and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto
them i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my
people are wicked
intreat the lord for it is enough that there be no more mighty
thunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay no
longer
and moses said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the city i
will spread abroad my hands unto the lord and the thunder shall
cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know how
that the earth is the lords
but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet
fear the lord god
and the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was in
the ear and the flax was bolled
but the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not
grown up
and moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread abroad
his hands unto the lord and the thunders and hail ceased and the
rain was not poured upon the earth
and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders
were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his
servants
and the heart of pharaoh was hardened neither would he let the
children of israel go as the lord had spoken by moses
and the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i have
hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might shew
these my signs before him  and that thou mayest tell in the ears
of thy son and of thy sons son what things i have wrought in egypt
and my signs which i have done among them that ye may know how that i
am the lord
and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus
saith the lord god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble
thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me
else if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow will
i bring the locusts into thy coast  and they shall cover the face
of the earth that one cannot be able to see the earth and they shall
eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you
from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of
the field  and they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all
thy servants and the houses of all the egyptians which neither thy
fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they
were upon the earth unto this day and he turned himself and went out
from pharaoh
and pharaohs servants said unto him how long shall this man be
a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the lord their
god knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed   and moses and
aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go
serve the lord your god but who are they that shall go   and
moses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sons
and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we go
for we must hold a feast unto the lord
and he said unto them let the lord be so with you as i will
let you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before you
not so go now ye that are men and serve the lord for that ye
did desire and they were driven out from pharaohs presence
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the
land of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of
egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath
left
and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt and
the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that
night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts
and the locust went up over all the land of egypt and rested in
all the coasts of egypt very grievous were they before them there
were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such
for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land
was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the
fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any
green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all
the land of egypt
then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said i
have sinned against the lord your god and against you
now therefore forgive i pray thee my sin only this once and
intreat the lord your god that he may take away from me this death
only
and he went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord
and the lord turned a mighty strong west wind which took away
the locusts and cast them into the red sea there remained not one
locust in all the coasts of egypt
but the lord hardened pharaohs heart so that he would not let
the children of israel go
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand toward
heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even
darkness which may be felt
and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was
a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days  they saw
not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but
all the children of israel had light in their dwellings
and pharaoh called unto moses and said go ye serve the lord
only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones
also go with you
and moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
offerings that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god
our cattle also shall go with us there shall not an hoof be
left behind for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god and
we know not with what we must serve the lord until we come thither
but the lord hardened pharaohs heart and he would not let them
go
and pharaoh said unto him get thee from me take heed to
thyself see my face no more for in that day thou seest my face thou
shalt die
and moses said thou hast spoken well i will see thy face again
no more
and the lord said unto moses yet will i bring one plague more
upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence
when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence
altogether
speak now in the ears of the people and let every man borrow of
his neighbour and every woman of her neighbour jewels of silver and
jewels of gold
and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the
egyptians
moreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in the
sight of pharaohs servants and in the sight of the people
and moses said thus saith the lord about midnight will i go out
into the midst of egypt  and all the firstborn in the land of
egypt shall die from the first born of pharaoh that sitteth upon his
throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the
mill and all the firstborn of beasts
and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt
such as there was none like it nor shall be like it any more
but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog move
his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the lord
doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel
and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down
themselves unto me saying get thee out and all the people that
follow thee and after that i will go out and he went out from
pharaoh in a great anger
and the lord said unto moses pharaoh shall not hearken unto you
that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt
and moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and
the lord hardened pharaohs heart so that he would not let the
children of israel go out of his land
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt
saying  this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it
shall be the first month of the year to you
speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the
tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb
according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house  and
if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbour
next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls
every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb
your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye
shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats  and ye shall
keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole
assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening
and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side
posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat
it
and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and
unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it
eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with
fire his head with his legs and with the purtenance thereof
and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and
that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire
and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on
your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste
it is the lords passover
for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will
smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and
against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where
ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague
shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep
it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ye shall keep it a
feast by an ordinance for ever
seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread even the first day ye
shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth
leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul
shall be cut off from israel
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation and in
the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you no manner
of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat
that only may be done of you
and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this
selfsame day have i brought your armies out of the land of egypt
therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an
ordinance for ever
in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even
ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the
month at even
seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for
whosoever eateth that which is leavened even that soul shall be cut
off from the congregation of israel whether he be a stranger or born
in the land
ye shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye
eat unleavened bread
then moses called for all the elders of israel and said unto
them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and
kill the passover
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood
that is in the bason and strike the lintel and the two side posts
with the blood that is in the bason and none of you shall go out at
the door of his house until the morning
for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when
he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts the
lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to
come in unto your houses to smite you
and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to
thy sons for ever
and it shall come to pass when ye be come to the land which the
lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep
this service
and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto
you what mean ye by this service   that ye shall say it is the
sacrifice of the lords passover who passed over the houses of the
children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and
delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshipped
and the children of israel went away and did as the lord had
commanded moses and aaron so did they
and it came to pass that at midnight the lord smote all the
firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat
on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the
dungeon and all the firstborn of cattle
and pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and
all the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there was
not a house where there was not one dead
and he called for moses and aaron by night and said rise up
and get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of
israel and go serve the lord as ye have said
also take your flocks and your herds as ye have said and be
gone and bless me also
and the egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might
send them out of the land in haste for they said we be all dead men
and the people took their dough before it was leavened their
kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders
and the children of israel did according to the word of moses
and they borrowed of the egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of
gold and raiment  and the lord gave the people favour in the
sight of the egyptians so that they lent unto them such things as
they required and they spoiled the egyptians
and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth
about six hundred thousand on foot that were men beside children
and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and
herds even very much cattle
and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
forth out of egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust
out of egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared for
themselves any victual
now the sojourning of the children of israel who dwelt in
egypt was four hundred and thirty years
and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty
years even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the hosts of
the lord went out from the land of egypt
it is a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringing
them out from the land of egypt this is that night of the lord to be
observed of all the children of israel in their generations
and the lord said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance of
the passover there shall no stranger eat thereof  but every
mans servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised
him then shall he eat thereof
a foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof
in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth ought
of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone
thereof
all the congregation of israel shall keep it
and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the
passover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then let
him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the
land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof
one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger
that sojourneth among you
thus did all the children of israel as the lord commanded moses
and aaron so did they
and it came to pass the selfsame day that the lord did bring
the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies
and the lord spake unto moses saying  sanctify unto me all
the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of
israel both of man and of beast it is mine
and moses said unto the people remember this day in which ye
came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of
hand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavened
bread be eaten
this day came ye out in the month abib
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of
the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the hivites
and the jebusites which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee a
land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in
this month
seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh
day shall be a feast to the lord
unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days and there shall no
leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen
with thee in all thy quarters
and thou shalt shew thy son in that day saying this is done
because of that which the lord did unto me when i came forth out of
egypt
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for a
memorial between thine eyes that the lords law may be in thy mouth
for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt
thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year
to year
and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of
the canaanites as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers and shall
give it thee  that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that
openeth the matrix and every firstling that cometh of a beast which
thou hast the males shall be the lords
and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and
if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all
the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem
and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come
saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of
hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage
and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that
the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the
firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice to
the lord all that openeth the matrix being males but all the
firstborn of my children i redeem
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand and for frontlets
between thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth
out of egypt
and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that
god led them not through the way of the land of the philistines
although that was near for god said lest peradventure the people
repent when they see war and they return to egypt  but god led
the people about through the way of the wilderness of the red sea
and the children of israel went up harnessed out of the land of egypt
and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitly
sworn the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and
ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you
and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham
in the edge of the wilderness
and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to
lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them
light to go by day and night  he took not away the pillar of
the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the
people
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the
children of israel that they turn and encamp before pihahiroth
between migdol and the sea over against baalzephon before it shall
ye encamp by the sea
for pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are
entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in
and i will harden pharaohs heart that he shall follow after
them and i will be honoured upon pharaoh and upon all his host that
the egyptians may know that i am the lord and they did so
and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled and the
heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people
and they said why have we done this that we have let israel go from
serving us   and he made ready his chariot and took his people
with him  and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the
chariots of egypt and captains over every one of them
and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he
pursued after the children of israel and the children of israel went
out with an high hand
but the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots
of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them
encamping by the sea beside pihahiroth before baalzephon
and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up
their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they
were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord
and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt
hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou
dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt   is not this
the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we
may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the
egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness
and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and
see the salvation of the lord which he will shew to you to day for
the egyptians whom ye have seen to day ye shall see them again no
more for ever
the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace
and the lord said unto moses wherefore criest thou unto me
speak unto the children of israel that they go forward  but
lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and
divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through
the midst of the sea
and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and
they shall follow them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and
upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen
and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have
gotten me honour upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his
horsemen
and the angel of god which went before the camp of israel
removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from
before their face and stood behind them  and it came between
the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloud
and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the
one came not near the other all the night
and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord
caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and
made the sea dry land and the waters were divided
and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon
the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right
hand and on their left
and the egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst
of the sea even all pharaohs horses his chariots and his horsemen
and it came to pass that in the morning watch the lord looked
unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the
cloud and troubled the host of the egyptians  and took off
their chariot wheels that they drave them heavily so that the
egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for the lord
fighteth for them against the egyptians
and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the
sea that the waters may come again upon the egyptians upon their
chariots and upon their horsemen
and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea
returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the egyptians
fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of
the sea
and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the
horsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after
them there remained not so much as one of them
but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of
the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and
on their left
thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the
egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore
and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the
egyptians and the people feared the lord and believed the lord and
his servant moses
then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the
lord and spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he hath
triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea
the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation
he is my god and i will prepare him an habitation my fathers god
and i will exalt him
the lord is a man of war the lord is his name
pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his
chosen captains also are drowned in the red sea
the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a
stone
thy right hand o lord is become glorious in power thy right
hand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
them that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath which
consumed them as stubble
and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
together the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were
congealed in the heart of the sea
the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the
spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my
hand shall destroy them
thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank
as lead in the mighty waters
who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee
glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders   thou
stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them
thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
habitation
the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold on
the inhabitants of palestina
then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moab
trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan
shall melt away
fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine
arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over o
lord till the people pass over which thou hast purchased
thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of
thine inheritance in the place o lord which thou hast made for thee
to dwell in in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have
established
the lord shall reign for ever and ever
for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
horsemen into the sea and the lord brought again the waters of the
sea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in the
midst of the sea
and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel
in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and
with dances
and miriam answered them sing ye to the lord for he hath
triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea
so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into
the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness
and found no water
and when they came to marah they could not drink of the waters
of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called
marah
and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we
drink   and he cried unto the lord and the lord shewed him a
tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made
sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he
proved them  and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the
voice of the lord thy god and wilt do that which is right in his
sight and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all his
statutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have
brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee
and they came to elim where were twelve wells of water and
threescore and ten palm trees and they encamped there by the waters
and they took their journey from elim and all the congregation
of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which is
between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after
their departing out of the land of egypt
and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured
against moses and aaron in the wilderness  and the children of
israel said unto them would to god we had died by the hand of the
lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we
did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this
wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger
then said the lord unto moses behold i will rain bread from
heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate
every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or
no
and it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall
prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as
they gather daily
and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel at
even then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the
land of egypt  and in the morning then ye shall see the glory of
the lord for that he heareth your murmurings against the lord and
what are we that ye murmur against us   and moses said this
shall be when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat
and in the morning bread to the full for that the lord heareth your
murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we your
murmurings are not against us but against the lord
and moses spake unto aaron say unto all the congregation of the
children of israel come near before the lord for he hath heard your
murmurings
and it came to pass as aaron spake unto the whole congregation
of the children of israel that they looked toward the wilderness
and behold the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud
and the lord spake unto moses saying  i have heard the
murmurings of the children of israel speak unto them saying at even
ye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread
and ye shall know that i am the lord your god
and it came to pass that at even the quails came up and
covered the camp and in the morning the dew lay round about the host
and when the dew that lay was gone up behold upon the face of
the wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the hoar
frost on the ground
and when the children of israel saw it they said one to
another it is manna for they wist not what it was and moses said
unto them this is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat
this is the thing which the lord hath commanded gather of it
every man according to his eating an omer for every man according to
the number of your persons take ye every man for them which are in
his tents
and the children of israel did so and gathered some more some
less
and when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered much
had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they
gathered every man according to his eating
and moses said let no man leave of it till the morning
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses but some of them
left of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and moses
was wroth with them
and they gathered it every morning every man according to his
eating and when the sun waxed hot it melted
and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice
as much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of the
congregation came and told moses
and he said unto them this is that which the lord hath said to
morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord bake that which
ye will bake to day and seethe that ye will seethe and that which
remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning
and they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it did
not stink neither was there any worm therein
and moses said eat that to day for to day is a sabbath unto
the lord to day ye shall not find it in the field
six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day which is
the sabbath in it there shall be none
and it came to pass that there went out some of the people on
the seventh day for to gather and they found none
and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my
commandments and my laws   see for that the lord hath given you
the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two
days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place
on the seventh day
so the people rested on the seventh day
and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it
was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers
made with honey
and moses said this is the thing which the lord commandeth
fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may see
the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness when i brought
you forth from the land of egypt
and moses said unto aaron take a pot and put an omer full of
manna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept for your
generations
as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the
testimony to be kept
and the children of israel did eat manna forty years until they
came to a land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto the
borders of the land of canaan
now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah
and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from
the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the
commandment of the lord and pitched in rephidim and there was no
water for the people to drink
wherefore the people did chide with moses and said give us
water that we may drink and moses said unto them why chide ye with
me wherefore do ye tempt the lord   and the people thirsted
there for water and the people murmured against moses and said
wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of egypt to kill
us and our children and our cattle with thirst   and moses cried
unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they be
almost ready to stone me
and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take
with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest
the river take in thine hand and go
behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb
and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it
that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders
of israel
and he called the name of the place massah and meribah because
of the chiding of the children of israel and because they tempted the
lord saying is the lord among us or not   then came amalek
and fought with israel in rephidim
and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight
with amalek to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the
rod of god in mine hand
so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek
and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill
and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel
prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed
but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it
under him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed up his hands
the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his
hands were steady until the going down of the sun
and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of
the sword
and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in a
book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put
out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven
and moses built an altar and called the name of it
jehovahnissi  for he said because the lord hath sworn that the
lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation
when jethro the priest of midian moses father in law heard of
all that god had done for moses and for israel his people and that
the lord had brought israel out of egypt  then jethro moses
father in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her back
and her two sons of which the name of the one was gershom for
he said i have been an alien in a strange land  and the name of
the other was eliezer for the god of my father said he was mine
help and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh  and jethro
moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto moses into
the wilderness where he encamped at the mount of god  and he
said unto moses i thy father in law jethro am come unto thee and thy
wife and her two sons with her
and moses went out to meet his father in law and did obeisance
and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they
came into the tent
and moses told his father in law all that the lord had done unto
pharaoh and to the egyptians for israels sake and all the travail
that had come upon them by the way and how the lord delivered them
and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had done
to israel whom he had delivered out of the hand of the egyptians
and jethro said blessed be the lord who hath delivered you out
of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of pharaoh who hath
delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians
now i know that the lord is greater than all gods for in the
thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them
and jethro moses father in law took a burnt offering and
sacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel to
eat bread with moses father in law before god
and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge the
people and the people stood by moses from the morning unto the
evening
and when moses father in law saw all that he did to the people
he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest
thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto
even   and moses said unto his father in law because the people
come unto me to enquire of god  when they have a matter they
come unto me and i judge between one and another and i do make them
know the statutes of god and his laws
and moses father in law said unto him the thing that thou
doest is not good
thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is
with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to
perform it thyself alone
hearken now unto my voice i will give thee counsel and god
shall be with thee be thou for the people to godward that thou
mayest bring the causes unto god  and thou shalt teach them
ordinances and laws and shalt shew them the way wherein they must
walk and the work that they must do
moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such
as fear god men of truth hating covetousness and place such over
them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers of
fifties and rulers of tens  and let them judge the people at
all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring
unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be
easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee
if thou shalt do this thing and god command thee so then thou
shalt be able to endure and all this people shall also go to their
place in peace
so moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law and did
all that he had said
and moses chose able men out of all israel and made them heads
over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of
fifties and rulers of tens
and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they
brought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves
and moses let his father in law depart and he went his way into
his own land
in the third month when the children of israel were gone forth
out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilderness
of sinai
for they were departed from rephidim and were come to the desert
of sinai and had pitched in the wilderness and there israel camped
before the mount
and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of
the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and
tell the children of israel  ye have seen what i did unto the
egyptians and how i bare you on eagles wings and brought you unto
myself
now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my
covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all
people for all the earth is mine  and ye shall be unto me a
kingdom of priests and an holy nation
these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of
israel
and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid
before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him
and all the people answered together and said all that the lord
hath spoken we will do and moses returned the words of the people
unto the lord
and the lord said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thick
cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and believe
thee for ever
and moses told the words of the people unto the lord
and the lord said unto moses go unto the people and sanctify
them to day and to morrow and let them wash their clothes  and
be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come
down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying
take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch
the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to
death  there shall not an hand touch it but he shall surely be
stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not
live when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mount
and moses went down from the mount unto the people and
sanctified the people and they washed their clothes
and he said unto the people be ready against the third day
come not at your wives
and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there
were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and
the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that
was in the camp trembled
and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with
god and they stood at the nether part of the mount
and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke because the lord
descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke
of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly
and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder
and louder moses spake and god answered him by a voice
and the lord came down upon mount sinai on the top of the
mount and the lord called moses up to the top of the mount and moses
went up
and the lord said unto moses go down charge the people lest
they break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them perish
and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctify
themselves lest the lord break forth upon them
and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come up to mount
sinai for thou chargedst us saying set bounds about the mount and
sanctify it
and the lord said unto him away get thee down and thou shalt
come up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and the
people break through to come up unto the lord lest he break forth
upon them
so moses went down unto the people and spake unto them
and god spake all these words saying  i am the lord thy
god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the
house of bondage
thou shalt have no other gods before me
thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness
of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath
or that is in the water under the earth
thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i
the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them
that hate me  and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love
me and keep my commandments
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the
lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
remember the sabbath day to keep it holy
six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work  but the
seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not
do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor
thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy
gates  for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea
and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the
lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon
the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not commit adultery
thou shalt not steal
thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour
thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house thou shalt not covet
thy neighbours wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his
ox nor his ass nor any thing that is thy neighbours
and all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and
the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the
people saw it they removed and stood afar off
and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear
but let not god speak with us lest we die
and moses said unto the people fear not for god is come to
prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that ye sin
not
and the people stood afar off and moses drew near unto the
thick darkness where god was
and the lord said unto moses thus thou shalt say unto the
children of israel ye have seen that i have talked with you from
heaven
ye shall not make with me gods of silver neither shall ye make
unto you gods of gold
an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me and shalt sacrifice
thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings thy sheep and
thine oxen in all places where i record my name i will come unto
thee and i will bless thee
and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone thou shalt not build
it of hewn stone for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast
polluted it
neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar that thy
nakedness be not discovered thereon
now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them

understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship
to devise cunning works to work in gold and in silver and in
brass  and in cutting of stones to set them and in carving of
timber to work in all manner of workmanship
and i behold i have given with him aholiab the son of
ahisamach of the tribe of dan and in the hearts of all that are wise
hearted i have put wisdom that they may make all that i have
commanded thee  the tabernacle of the congregation and the ark

and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak thou also
unto the children of israel saying verily my sabbaths ye shall keep
for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations that
ye may know that i am the lord that doth sanctify you
ye shall keep the sabbath therefore for it is holy unto you
every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death for whosoever
doeth any work therein that soul shall be cut off from among his
people
six days may work be done but in the seventh is the sabbath of
rest holy to the lord whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day
he shall surely be put to death
wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to
observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual
covenant
it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever for
in six days the lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he
rested and was refreshed
and he gave unto moses when he had made an end of communing
with him upon mount sinai two tables of testimony tables of stone
written with the finger of god
and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of
the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and
said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for
this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we
wot not what is become of him
and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which
are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters
and bring them unto me
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in
their ears and brought them unto aaron
and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a
graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these
be thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt
and when aaron saw it he built an altar before it and aaron
made proclamation and said to morrow is a feast to the lord
and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt
offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat
and to drink and rose up to play
and the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people
which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt have corrupted
themselves  they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i
commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped
it and have sacrificed thereunto and said these be thy gods o
israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt
and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and
behold it is a stiffnecked people  now therefore let me alone
that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them
and i will make of thee a great nation
and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doth
thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth
out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand
wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did
he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them
from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of
this evil against thy people
remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou
swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply your
seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of
will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever
and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
his people
and moses turned and went down from the mount and the two
tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on
both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written
and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the
writing of god graven upon the tables
and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted
he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp
and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery
neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the
noise of them that sing do i hear
and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that
he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he
cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount
and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the
fire and ground it to powder and strawed it upon the water and made
the children of israel drink of it
and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that
thou hast brought so great a sin upon them   and aaron said let
not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they
are set on mischief
for they said unto me make us gods which shall go before us
for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of
egypt we wot not what is become of him
and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it
off so they gave it me then i cast it into the fire and there came
out this calf
and when moses saw that the people were naked for aaron had
made them naked unto their shame among their enemies  then
moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lords
side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gathered
themselves together unto him
and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel put
every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate
throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his
companion and every man his neighbour
and the children of levi did according to the word of moses and
there fell of the people that day about three thousand men
for moses had said consecrate yourselves today to the lord
even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow
upon you a blessing this day
and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the
people ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto the
lord peradventure i shall make an atonement for your sin
and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have
sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold
yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me
i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written
and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me
him will i blot out of my book
therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which i have
spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee
nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them
and the lord plagued the people because they made the calf
which aaron made
and the lord said unto moses depart and go up hence thou and
the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt unto
the land which i sware unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying
unto thy seed will i give it  and i will send an angel before
thee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the
hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite  unto a
land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of
thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee in the
way
and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and
no man did put on him his ornaments
for the lord had said unto moses say unto the children of
israel ye are a stiffnecked people i will come up into the midst of
thee in a moment and consume thee therefore now put off thy
ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee
and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments
by the mount horeb
and moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the camp
afar off from the camp and called it the tabernacle of the
congregation and it came to pass that every one which sought the
lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was
without the camp
and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tabernacle
that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and
looked after moses until he was gone into the tabernacle
and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle the
cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and
the lord talked with moses
and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
door and all the people rose up and worshipped every man in his tent
door
and the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh
unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant
joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the
tabernacle
and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up
this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with
me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found
grace in my sight
now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight
shew me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in
thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people
and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give
thee rest
and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us
not up hence
for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have
found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so
shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are
upon the face of the earth
and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that
thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know
thee by name
and he said i beseech thee shew me thy glory
and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i
will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious
to whom i will be gracious and will shew mercy on whom i will shew
mercy
and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man
see me and live
and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou
shalt stand upon a rock  and it shall come to pass while my
glory passeth by that i will put thee in a clift of the rock and
will cover thee with my hand while i pass by  and i will take
away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall
not be seen
and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like
unto the first and i will write upon these tables the words that were
in the first tables which thou brakest
and be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto
mount sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount
and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen
throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before
that mount
and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses
rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount sinai as the
lord had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stone
and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there
and proclaimed the name of the lord
and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed the lord the
lord god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in
goodness and truth  keeping mercy for thousands forgiving
iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear
the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
and upon the childrens children unto the third and to the fourth
generation
and moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and
worshipped
and he said if now i have found grace in thy sight o lord let
my lord i pray thee go among us for it is a stiffnecked people and
pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance
and he said behold i make a covenant before all thy people i
will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in
any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work
of the lord for it is a terrible thing that i will do with thee
observe thou that which i command thee this day behold i drive
out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and
the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite
take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the
inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest it be for a snare in
the midst of thee  but ye shall destroy their altars break
their images and cut down their groves  for thou shalt worship
no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and
they go a whoring after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods
and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice  and thou take
of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go a whoring
after their gods and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods
thou shalt make thee no molten gods
the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep seven days thou
shalt eat unleavened bread as i commanded thee in the time of the
month abib for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt
all that openeth the matrix is mine and every firstling among
thy cattle whether ox or sheep that is male
but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and
if thou redeem him not then shalt thou break his neck all the
firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem and none shall appear before
me empty
six days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt
rest in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest
and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks of the firstfruits of
wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the years end
thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the
lord god the god of israel
for i will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy
borders neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shalt go up
to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven
neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto
the morning
the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
the house of the lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in his
mothers milk
and the lord said unto moses write thou these words for after
the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with
israel
and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights he
did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables
the words of the covenant the ten commandments
and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with
the two tables of testimony in moses hand when he came down from the
mount that moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he
talked with him
and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses behold
the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh him
and moses called unto them and aaron and all the rulers of the
congregation returned unto him and moses talked with them
and afterward all the children of israel came nigh and he gave
them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount
sinai
and till moses had done speaking with them he put a vail on his
face
but when moses went in before the lord to speak with him he
took the vail off until he came out and he came out and spake unto
the children of israel that which he was commanded
and the children of israel saw the face of moses that the skin
of moses face shone and moses put the vail upon his face again
until he went in to speak with him
and moses gathered all the congregation of the children of israel
together and said unto them these are the words which the lord hath
commanded that ye should do them
six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall
be to you an holy day a sabbath of rest to the lord whosoever doeth
work therein shall be put to death
ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
sabbath day

israel saying this is the thing which the lord commanded saying

the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the

of the lord filled the tabernacle
and moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
congregation because the cloud abode thereon and the glory of the
lord filled the tabernacle
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle the
children of israel went onward in all their journeys  but if the
cloud were not taken up then they journeyed not till the day that it
was taken up

fire was on it by night in the sight of all the house of israel
throughout all their journeys

him the blood which he sprinkled round about upon the altar
and they presented the burnt offering unto him with the pieces
thereof and the head and he burnt them upon the altar
and he did wash the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the
burnt offering on the altar
and he brought the peoples offering and took the goat which
was the sin offering for the people and slew it and offered it for
sin as the first
and he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to
the manner
and he brought the meat offering and took an handful thereof
and burnt it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the
morning
he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
offerings which was for the people and aarons sons presented unto
him the blood which he sprinkled upon the altar round about  and
the fat of the bullock and of the ram the rump and that which
covereth the inwards and the kidneys and the caul above the liver
and they put the fat upon the breasts and he burnt the fat upon
the altar  and the breasts and the right shoulder aaron waved for
a wave offering before the lord as moses commanded
and aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them
and came down from offering of the sin offering and the burnt
offering and peace offerings
and moses and aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation
and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the lord
appeared unto all the people
and there came a fire out from before the lord and consumed upon
the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people
saw they shouted and fell on their faces
and nadab and abihu the sons of aaron took either of them his
censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered
strange fire before the lord which he commanded them not
and there went out fire from the lord and devoured them and
they died before the lord
then moses said unto aaron this is it that the lord spake
saying i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before all
the people i will be glorified and aaron held his peace
and moses called mishael and elzaphan the sons of uzziel the
uncle of aaron and said unto them come near carry your brethren
from before the sanctuary out of the camp
so they went near and carried them in their coats out of the
camp as moses had said
and moses said unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his
sons uncover not your heads neither rend your clothes lest ye die
and lest wrath come upon all the people but let your brethren the
whole house of israel bewail the burning which the lord hath kindled
and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation lest ye die for the anointing oil of the lord is upon
you and they did according to the word of moses
and the lord spake unto aaron saying  do not drink wine nor
strong drink thou nor thy sons with thee when ye go into the
tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die it shall be a statute for
ever throughout your generations  and that ye may put difference
between holy and unholy and between unclean and clean  and that
ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which the lord
hath spoken unto them by the hand of moses
and moses spake unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar
his sons that were left take the meat offering that remaineth of the
offerings of the lord made by fire and eat it without leaven beside
the altar for it is most holy  and ye shall eat it in the holy
place because it is thy due and thy sons due of the sacrifices of
the lord made by fire for so i am commanded
and the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
place thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee for they be
thy due and thy sons due which are given out of the sacrifices of
peace offerings of the children of israel
the heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the
offerings made by fire of the fat to wave it for a wave offering
before the lord and it shall be thine and thy sons with thee by a
statute for ever as the lord hath commanded
and moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering and
behold it was burnt and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar the
sons of aaron which were left alive saying  wherefore have ye
not eaten the sin offering in the holy place seeing it is most holy
and god hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation to
make atonement for them before the lord   behold the blood of
it was not brought in within the holy place ye should indeed have
eaten it in the holy place as i commanded
and aaron said unto moses behold this day have they offered
their sin offering and their burnt offering before the lord and such
things have befallen me and if i had eaten the sin offering to day
should it have been accepted in the sight of the lord   and when
moses heard that he was content
and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron saying unto them
speak unto the children of israel saying these are the beasts
which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth
whatsoever parteth the hoof and is clovenfooted and cheweth the
cud among the beasts that shall ye eat

two young pigeons and bring them unto the priest to the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the
other for a burnt offering and the priest shall make an atonement for
her before the lord for the issue of her uncleanness
thus shall ye separate the children of israel from their
uncleanness that they die not in their uncleanness when they defile
my tabernacle that is among them
this is the law of him that hath an issue and of him whose seed
goeth from him and is defiled therewith  and of her that is
sick of her flowers and of him that hath an issue of the man and of
the woman and of him that lieth with her that is unclean
and the lord spake unto moses after the death of the two sons of
aaron when they offered before the lord and died  and the lord
said unto moses speak unto aaron thy brother that he come not at all
times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat which
is upon the ark that he die not for i will appear in the cloud upon
the mercy seat
thus shall aaron come into the holy place with a young bullock
for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering
he shall put on the holy linen coat and he shall have the linen
breeches upon his flesh and shall be girded with a linen girdle and
with the linen mitre shall he be attired these are holy garments
therefore shall he wash his flesh in water and so put them on
and he shall take of the congregation of the children of israel
two kids of the goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt
offering
and aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering which is
for himself and make an atonement for himself and for his house
and he shall take the two goats and present them before the lord
at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats one lot for the
lord and the other lot for the scapegoat
and aaron shall bring the goat upon which the lords lot fell
and offer him for a sin offering
but the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall
be presented alive before the lord to make an atonement with him and
to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness
and aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering which is
for himself and shall make an atonement for himself and for his
house and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for
himself  and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of
fire from off the altar before the lord and his hands full of sweet
incense beaten small and bring it within the vail  and he shall
put the incense upon the fire before the lord that the cloud of the
incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony that he
die not  and he shall take of the blood of the bullock and
sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward and before
the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven
times
then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the
people and bring his blood within the vail and do with that blood as
he did with the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it upon the mercy
seat and before the mercy seat  and he shall make an atonement
for the holy place because of the uncleanness of the children of
israel and because of their transgressions in all their sins and so
shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth
among them in the midst of their uncleanness
and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation
when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place until he come
out and have made an atonement for himself and for his household
and for all the congregation of israel
and he shall go out unto the altar that is before the lord and
make an atonement for it and shall take of the blood of the bullock
and of the blood of the goat and put it upon the horns of the altar
round about
and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven
times and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleanness of the
children of israel
and when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place and
the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar he shall bring the
live goat  and aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of
the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
of israel and all their transgressions in all their sins putting
them upon the head of the goat and shall send him away by the hand of
a fit man into the wilderness  and the goat shall bear upon him
all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited and he shall let go
the goat in the wilderness
and aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation
and shall put off the linen garments which he put on when he went
into the holy place and shall leave them there  and he shall
wash his flesh with water in the holy place and put on his garments
and come forth and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering
of the people and make an atonement for himself and for the people
and the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar
and he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
clothes and bathe his flesh in water and afterward come into the
camp
and the bullock for the sin offering and the goat for the sin
offering whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy
place shall one carry forth without the camp and they shall burn in
the fire their skins and their flesh and their dung
and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes and bathe his
flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp
and this shall be a statute for ever unto you that in the
seventh month on the tenth day of the month ye shall afflict your
souls and do no work at all whether it be one of your own country
or a stranger that sojourneth among you  for on that day shall
the priest make an atonement for you to cleanse you that ye may be
clean from all your sins before the lord
it shall be a sabbath of rest unto you and ye shall afflict
your souls by a statute for ever
and the priest whom he shall anoint and whom he shall
consecrate to minister in the priests office in his fathers stead
shall make the atonement and shall put on the linen clothes even the
holy garments  and he shall make an atonement for the holy
sanctuary and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
congregation and for the altar and he shall make an atonement for
the priests and for all the people of the congregation
and this shall be an everlasting statute unto you to make an
atonement for the children of israel for all their sins once a year
and he did as the lord commanded moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto aaron and
unto his sons and unto all the children of israel and say unto them
this is the thing which the lord hath commanded saying  what man
soever there be of the house of israel that killeth an ox or lamb
or goat in the camp or that killeth it out of the camp  and
bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
to offer an offering unto the lord before the tabernacle of the lord
blood shall be imputed unto that man he hath shed blood and that man
shall be cut off from among his people  to the end that the
children of israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the
open field even that they may bring them unto the lord unto the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation unto the priest and offer them
for peace offerings unto the lord
and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and burn the
fat for a sweet savour unto the lord
and they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils after
whom they have gone a whoring this shall be a statute for ever unto
them throughout their generations
and thou shalt say unto them whatsoever man there be of the
house of israel or of the strangers which sojourn among you that
offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice  and bringeth it not unto
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation to offer it unto the
lord even that man shall be cut off from among his people
and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel or of the
strangers that sojourn among you that eateth any manner of blood i
will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will
cut him off from among his people
for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given it
to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is
the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul
therefore i said unto the children of israel no soul of you
shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you
eat blood
and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel or of the
strangers that sojourn among you which hunteth and catcheth any beast
or fowl that may be eaten he shall even pour out the blood thereof
and cover it with dust
for it is the life of all flesh the blood of it is for the life
thereof therefore i said unto the children of israel ye shall eat
the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the
blood thereof whosoever eateth it shall be cut off
and every soul that eateth that which died of itself or that
which was torn with beasts whether it be one of your own country or
a stranger he shall both wash his clothes and bathe himself in
water and be unclean until the even then shall he be clean
but if he wash them not nor bathe his flesh then he shall bear
his iniquity
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the
children of israel and say unto them i am the lord your god

not do and after the doings of the land of canaan whither i bring
you shall ye not do neither shall ye walk in their ordinances

and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto aaron
saying whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any
blemish let him not approach to offer the bread of his god

the holy
only he shall not go in unto the vail nor come nigh unto the
altar because he hath a blemish that he profane not my sanctuaries
for i the lord do sanctify them
and moses told it unto aaron and to his sons and unto all the
children of israel
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto aaron and
to his sons that they separate themselves from the holy things of the
children of israel and that they profane not my holy name in those
things which they hallow unto me i am the lord
say unto them whosoever he be of all your seed among your
generations that goeth unto the holy things which the children of
israel hallow unto the lord having his uncleanness upon him that

running issue he shall not eat of the holy things until he be clean
and whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead or a man
whose seed goeth from him  or whosoever toucheth any creeping

uncleanness whatsoever uncleanness he hath  the soul which hath
touched any such shall be unclean until even and shall not eat of the
holy things unless he wash his flesh with water
and when the sun is down he shall be clean and shall afterward
eat of the holy things because it is his food

with the holy thing
and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
israel which they offer unto the lord  or suffer them to bear
the iniquity of trespass when they eat their holy things for i the
lord do sanctify them
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto aaron
and to his sons and unto all the children of israel and say unto

lord
and the lord spake unto moses saying  command the children
of israel that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the
light to cause the lamps to burn continually
without the vail of the testimony in the tabernacle of the

and the son of an israelitish woman whose father was an
egyptian went out among the children of israel and this son of the
israelitish woman and a man of israel strove together in the camp
and the israelitish womans son blasphemed the name of the lord
and cursed and they brought him unto moses and his mothers name
was shelomith the daughter of dibri of the tribe of dan  and
they put him in ward that the mind of the lord might be shewed them
and the lord spake unto moses saying  bring forth him
that hath cursed without the camp and let all that heard him lay
their hands upon his head and let all the congregation stone him
and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying
whosoever curseth his god shall bear his sin
and he that blasphemeth the name of the lord he shall surely be
put to death and all the congregation shall certainly stone him as
well the stranger as he that is born in the land when he blasphemeth
the name of the lord shall be put to death
and he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death
and he that killeth a beast shall make it good beast for beast
and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour as he hath done
so shall it be done to him  breach for breach eye for eye
tooth for tooth as he hath caused a blemish in a man so shall it be
done to him again
and he that killeth a beast he shall restore it and he that
killeth a man he shall be put to death
ye shall have one manner of law as well for the stranger as
for one of your own country for i am the lord your god
and moses spake to the children of israel that they should
bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp and stone him with
stones and the children of israel did as the lord commanded moses
and the lord spake unto moses in mount sinai saying  speak
unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the
land which i give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the
lord
six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt
prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof  but in the
seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for
the lord thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard
that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
not reap neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed for it is a
year of rest unto the land
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and
for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for
thy stranger that sojourneth with thee
and for thy cattle and for the beast that are in thy land shall
all the increase thereof be meat
and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven
times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall
be unto thee forty and nine years
then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the
tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make
the trumpet sound throughout all your land
and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty
throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be
a jubile unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession
and ye shall return every man unto his family
a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow
neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes
in it of thy vine undressed
for it is the jubile it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat
the increase thereof out of the field
in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
possession
and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour or buyest ought of
thy neighbours hand ye shall not oppress one another
according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of
thy neighbour and according unto the number of years of the fruits he
shall sell unto thee  according to the multitude of years thou
shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of
years thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number
of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee
ye shall not therefore oppress one another but thou shalt fear
thy godfor i am the lord your god
wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do
them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety
and the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your fill
and dwell therein in safety
and if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold
we shall not sow nor gather in our increase  then i will
command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring
forth fruit for three years
and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until
the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old
store
the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for
ye are strangers and sojourners with me
and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
redemption for the land
if thy brother be waxen poor and hath sold away some of his
possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he
redeem that which his brother sold
and if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to
redeem it  then let him count the years of the sale thereof and
restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may
return unto his possession
but if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is
sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the
year of jubile and in the jubile it shall go out and he shall return
unto his possession
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city then he may
redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year may
he redeem it
and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then
the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to
him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go out in
the jubile
but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be
redeemed and they shall go out in the jubile
notwithstanding the cities of the levites and the houses of the
cities of their possession may the levites redeem at any time
and if a man purchase of the levites then the house that was
sold and the city of his possession shall go out in the year of
jubile for the houses of the cities of the levites are their
possession among the children of israel
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold
for it is their perpetual possession
and if thy brother be waxen poor and fallen in decay with thee
then thou shalt relieve him yea though he be a stranger or a
sojourner that he may live with thee
take thou no usury of him or increase but fear thy god that
thy brother may live with thee
thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury nor lend him thy
victuals for increase
i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land
of egypt to give you the land of canaan and to be your god
and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor and be
sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant
but as an hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with
thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile
and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children
with him and shall return unto his own family and unto the
possession of his fathers shall he return
for they are my servants which i brought forth out of the land
of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen
thou shalt not rule over him with rigour but shalt fear thy
god
both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids which thou shalt have
shall be of the heathen that are round about you of them shall ye buy
bondmen and bondmaids
moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among
you of them shall ye buy and of their families that are with you
which they begat in your land and they shall be your possession
and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after
you to inherit them for a possession they shall be your bondmen for
ever but over your brethren the children of israel ye shall not rule
one over another with rigour
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee and thy brother
that dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or
sojourner by thee or to the stock of the strangers family
after that he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his brethren
may redeem him  either his uncle or his uncles son may redeem
him or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him
or if he be able he may redeem himself
and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that
he was sold to him unto the year of jubile and the price of his sale
shall be according unto the number of years according to the time of
an hired servant shall it be with him
if there be yet many years behind according unto them he shall
give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was
bought for
and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile then
he shall count with him and according unto his years shall he give
him again the price of his redemption
and as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him and the
other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight
and if he be not redeemed in these years then he shall go out
in the year of jubile both he and his children with him
for unto me the children of israel are servants they are my
servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt i am the lord
your god
ye shall make you no idols nor graven image neither rear you up
a standing image neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your
land to bow down unto it for i am the lord your god
ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary i am the
lord
if ye walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them
then i will give you rain in due season and the land shall yield
her increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit
and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage and the vintage
shall reach unto the sowing time and ye shall eat your bread to the
full and dwell in your land safely
and i will give peace in the land and ye shall lie down and
none shall make you afraid and i will rid evil beasts out of the
land neither shall the sword go through your land
and ye shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you
by the sword
and five of you shall chase an hundred and an hundred of you
shall put ten thousand to flight and your enemies shall fall before
you by the sword
for i will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and
multiply you and establish my covenant with you
and ye shall eat old store and bring forth the old because of
the new
and i set my tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor
you
and i will walk among you and will be your god and ye shall be
my people
i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land
of egypt that ye should not be their bondmen and i have broken the
bands of your yoke and made you go upright
but if ye will not hearken unto me and will not do all these
commandments  and if ye shall despise my statutes or if your
soul abhor my judgments so that ye will not do all my commandments
but that ye break my covenant  i also will do this unto you i
will even appoint over you terror consumption and the burning ague
that shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart and ye shall
sow your seed in vain for your enemies shall eat it
and i will set my face against you and ye shall be slain before
your enemies they that hate you shall reign over you and ye shall
flee when none pursueth you
and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me then i will
punish you seven times more for your sins
and i will break the pride of your power and i will make your
heaven as iron and your earth as brass  and your strength shall
be spent in vain for your land shall not yield her increase neither
shall the trees of the land yield their fruits
and if ye walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me i
will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins
i will also send wild beasts among you which shall rob you of
your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number
and your high ways shall be desolate
and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things but will
walk contrary unto me  then will i also walk contrary unto you
and will punish you yet seven times for your sins
and i will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel
of my covenant and when ye are gathered together within your cities
i will send the pestilence among you and ye shall be delivered into
the hand of the enemy
and when i have broken the staff of your bread ten women shall
bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliver you your bread
again by weight and ye shall eat and not be satisfied
and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me but walk
contrary unto me  then i will walk contrary unto you also in
fury and i even i will chastise you seven times for your sins
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your
daughters shall ye eat
and i will destroy your high places and cut down your images
and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols and my soul
shall abhor you
and i will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries
unto desolation and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odours
and i will bring the land into desolation and your enemies
which dwell therein shall be astonished at it
and i will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a
sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your cities
waste
then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths as long as it lieth
desolate and ye be in your enemies land even then shall the land
rest and enjoy her sabbaths
as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest because it did not
rest in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it
and upon them that are left alive of you i will send a faintness
into their hearts in the lands of their enemies and the sound of a
shaken leaf shall chase them and they shall flee as fleeing from a
sword and they shall fall when none pursueth
and they shall fall one upon another as it were before a sword
when none pursueth and ye shall have no power to stand before your
enemies
and ye shall perish among the heathen and the land of your
enemies shall eat you up
and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity
in your enemies lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers
shall they pine away with them
if they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their
fathers with their trespass which they trespassed against me and
that also they have walked contrary unto me  and that i also
have walked contrary unto them and have brought them into the land of
their enemies if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they
then accept of the punishment of their iniquity  then will i
remember my covenant with jacob and also my covenant with isaac and
also my covenant with abraham will i remember and i will remember the
land
the land also shall be left of them and shall enjoy her
sabbaths while she lieth desolate without them and they shall accept
of the punishment of their iniquity because even because they
despised my judgments and because their soul abhorred my statutes
and yet for all that when they be in the land of their enemies
i will not cast them away neither will i abhor them to destroy them
utterly and to break my covenant with them for i am the lord their
god
but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
ancestors whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight
of the heathen that i might be their god i am the lord
these are the statutes and judgments and laws which the lord
made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand
of moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the
children of israel and say unto them when a man shall make a
singular vow the persons shall be for the lord by thy estimation
and thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old
even unto sixty years old even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels
of silver after the shekel of the sanctuary

himself before the priest and the priest shall value him according
to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him
and if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto the
lord all that any man giveth of such unto the lord shall be holy
he shall not alter it nor change it a good for a bad or a bad
for a good and if he shall at all change beast for beast then it and
the exchange thereof shall be holy
and if it be any unclean beast of which they do not offer a
sacrifice unto the lord then he shall present the beast before the
priest  and the priest shall value it whether it be good or
bad as thou valuest it who art the priest so shall it be
but if he will at all redeem it then he shall add a fifth part
thereof unto thy estimation
and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the

of his possession then thy estimation shall be according to the seed
thereof an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of
silver

thy estimation it shall stand
but if he sanctify his field after the jubile then the priest
shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain
even unto the year of the jubile and it shall be abated from thy
estimation
and if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it
then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
it and it shall be assured to him
and if he will not redeem the field or if he have sold the
field to another man it shall not be redeemed any more
but the field when it goeth out in the jubile shall be holy
unto the lord as a field devoted the possession thereof shall be the
priests
and if a man sanctify unto the lord a field which he hath
bought which is not of the fields of his possession  then the
priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation even unto
the year of the jubile and he shall give thine estimation in that
day as a holy thing unto the lord
in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of
whom it was bought even to him to whom the possession of the land did
belong
and all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the
sanctuary twenty gerahs shall be the shekel
only the firstling of the beasts which should be the lords
firstling no man shall sanctify it whether it be ox or sheep it is
the lords
and if it be of an unclean beast then he shall redeem it
according to thine estimation and shall add a fifth part of it
thereto or if it be not redeemed then it shall be sold according to
thy estimation
notwithstanding no devoted thing that a man shall devote unto
the lord of all that he hath both of man and beast and of the field
of his possession shall be sold or redeemed every devoted thing is
most holy unto the lord
none devoted which shall be devoted of men shall be redeemed
but shall surely be put to death
and all the tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land
or of the fruit of the tree is the lords it is holy unto the lord
and if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes he shall
add thereto the fifth part thereof
and concerning the tithe of the herd or of the flock even of
whatsoever passeth under the rod the tenth shall be holy unto the
lord
he shall not search whether it be good or bad neither shall he
change it and if he change it at all then both it and the change
thereof shall be holy it shall not be redeemed
these are the commandments which the lord commanded moses for
the children of israel in mount sinai

tabernacle of the congregation on the first day of the second month

and the lord spake unto moses saying  command the children of
israel that they put out of the camp every leper and every one that
hath an issue and whosoever is defiled by the dead  both male and
female shall ye put out without the camp shall ye put them that they
defile not their camps in the midst whereof i dwell
and the children of israel did so and put them out without the
camp as the lord spake unto moses so did the children of israel
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the children
of israel when a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit
to do a trespass against the lord and that person be guilty  then
they shall confess their sin which they have done and he shall
recompense his trespass with the principal thereof and add unto it
the fifth part thereof and give it unto him against whom he hath
trespassed
but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto
let the trespass be recompensed unto the lord even to the priest
beside the ram of the atonement whereby an atonement shall be made
for him
and every offering of all the holy things of the children of
israel which they bring unto the priest shall be his
and every mans hallowed things shall be his whatsoever any man
giveth the priest it shall be his
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the
children of israel and say unto them if any mans wife go aside and
commit a trespass against him  and a man lie with her carnally
and it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept close and she
be defiled and there be no witness against her neither she be taken
with the manner  and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he
be jealous of his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit of
jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be not
defiled  then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest and
he shall bring her offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of
barley meal he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense
thereon for it is an offering of jealousy an offering of memorial
bringing iniquity to remembrance
and the priest shall bring her near and set her before the lord
and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel and of
the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take
and put it into the water  and the priest shall set the woman
before the lord and uncover the womans head and put the offering of
memorial in her hands which is the jealousy offering and the priest
shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse
and the priest shall charge her by an oath and say unto the woman if
no man have lain with thee and if thou hast not gone aside to
uncleanness with another instead of thy husband be thou free from
this bitter water that causeth the curse  but if thou hast gone
aside to another instead of thy husband and if thou be defiled and
some man have lain with thee beside thine husband  then the
priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing and the priest
shall say unto the woman the lord make thee a curse and an oath among
thy people when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to
swell  and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy
bowels to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot and the
woman shall say amen amen
and the priest shall write these curses in a book and he shall
blot them out with the bitter water  and he shall cause the woman
to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse and the water that
causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
womans hand and shall wave the offering before the lord and offer
it upon the altar  and the priest shall take an handful of the
offering even the memorial thereof and burn it upon the altar and
afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water
and when he hath made her to drink the water then it shall come
to pass that if she be defiled and have done trespass against her
husband that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her
and become bitter and her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot
and the woman shall be a curse among her people
and if the woman be not defiled but be clean then she shall be
free and shall conceive seed
this is the law of jealousies when a wife goeth aside to another
instead of her husband and is defiled  or when the spirit of
jealousy cometh upon him and he be jealous over his wife and shall
set the woman before the lord and the priest shall execute upon her
all this law
then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity and this woman
shall bear her iniquity
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the children
of israel and say unto them when either man or woman shall separate
themselves to vow a vow of a nazarite to separate themselves unto the
lord  he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and
shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither
shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made
of the vine tree from the kernels even to the husk
all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor
come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he
separateth himself unto the lord he shall be holy and shall let the
locks of the hair of his head grow
all the days that he separateth himself unto the lord he shall
come at no dead body
he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his
mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because the
consecration of his god is upon his head
all the days of his separation he is holy unto the lord
and if any man die very suddenly by him and he hath defiled the
head of his consecration then he shall shave his head in the day of
his cleansing on the seventh day shall he shave it
and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles or two young
pigeons to the priest to the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation  and the priest shall offer the one for a sin
offering and the other for a burnt offering and make an atonement
for him for that he sinned by the dead and shall hallow his head
that same day
and he shall consecrate unto the lord the days of his separation
and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering but
the days that were before shall be lost because his separation was
defiled
and this is the law of the nazarite when the days of his
separation are fulfilled he shall be brought unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation  and he shall offer his offering
unto the lord one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a
burnt offering and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for
a sin offering and one ram without blemish for peace offerings
and a basket of unleavened bread cakes of fine flour mingled with
oil and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil and their meat
offering and their drink offerings
and the priest shall bring them before the lord and shall offer
his sin offering and his burnt offering  and he shall offer the
ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord with the basket
of unleavened bread the priest shall offer also his meat offering
and his drink offering
and the nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation and shall take the hair of
the head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the
sacrifice of the peace offerings
and the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram and one
unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and shall
put them upon the hands of the nazarite after the hair of his
separation is shaven  and the priest shall wave them for a wave
offering before the lord this is holy for the priest with the wave
breast and heave shoulder and after that the nazarite may drink wine
this is the law of the nazarite who hath vowed and of his
offering unto the lord for his separation beside that that his hand
shall get according to the vow which he vowed so he must do after
the law of his separation
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto aaron and
unto his sons saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of
israel saying unto them  the lord bless thee and keep thee
the lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto
thee  the lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee
peace
and they shall put my name upon the children of israel and i
will bless them

silver vessels weighed two thousand and four hundred shekels after
the shekel of the sanctuary  the golden spoons were twelve full
of incense weighing ten shekels apiece after the shekel of the
sanctuary all the gold of the spoons was an hundred and twenty
shekels
all the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks the
rams twelve the lambs of the first year twelve with their meat
offering and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve
and all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were
twenty and four bullocks the rams sixty the he goats sixty the
lambs of the first year sixty this was the dedication of the altar
after that it was anointed
and when moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation
to speak with him then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him
from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony from
between the two cherubims and he spake unto him
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto aaron and
say unto him when thou lightest the lamps the seven lamps shall give
light over against the candlestick
and aaron did so he lighted the lamps thereof over against the
candlestick as the lord commanded moses
and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold unto the
shaft thereof unto the flowers thereof was beaten work according
unto the pattern which the lord had shewed moses so he made the
candlestick
and the lord spake unto moses saying  take the levites from
among the children of israel and cleanse them
and thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them sprinkle water
of purifying upon them and let them shave all their flesh and let
them wash their clothes and so make themselves clean
then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering even
fine flour mingled with oil and another young bullock shalt thou take
for a sin offering
and thou shalt bring the levites before the tabernacle of the
congregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children
of israel together  and thou shalt bring the levites before the
lord and the children of israel shall put their hands upon the
levites  and aaron shall offer the levites before the lord for an
offering of the children of israel that they may execute the service
of the lord
and the levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
bullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and the
other for a burnt offering unto the lord to make an atonement for
the levites
and thou shalt set the levites before aaron and before his sons
and offer them for an offering unto the lord
thus shalt thou separate the levites from among the children of
israel and the levites shall be mine
and after that shall the levites go in to do the service of the
tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt cleanse them and offer
them for an offering
for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
israel instead of such as open every womb even instead of the
firstborn of all the children of israel have i taken them unto me
for all the firstborn of the children of israel are mine both
man and beast on the day that i smote every firstborn in the land of
egypt i sanctified them for myself
and i have taken the levites for all the firstborn of the
children of israel
and i have given the levites as a gift to aaron and to his sons
from among the children of israel to do the service of the children
of israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make an
atonement for the children of israel that there be no plague among
the children of israel when the children of israel come nigh unto the
sanctuary
and moses and aaron and all the congregation of the children of
israel did to the levites according unto all that the lord commanded
moses concerning the levites so did the children of israel unto them
and the levites were purified and they washed their clothes and
aaron offered them as an offering before the lord and aaron made an
atonement for them to cleanse them
and after that went the levites in to do their service in the
tabernacle of the congregation before aaron and before his sons as
the lord had commanded moses concerning the levites so did they unto
them
and the lord spake unto moses saying  this is it that
belongeth unto the levites from twenty and five years old and upward
they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation  and from the age of fifty years they shall cease
waiting upon the service thereof and shall serve no more  but
shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the
congregation to keep the charge and shall do no service thus shalt
thou do unto the levites touching their charge
and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai in the
first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of
egypt saying  let the children of israel also keep the passover
at his appointed season
in the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in
his appointed season according to all the rites of it and according
to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it
and moses spake unto the children of israel that they should keep
the passover
and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
month at even in the wilderness of sinai according to all that the
lord commanded moses so did the children of israel
and there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a
man that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came
before moses and before aaron on that day  and those men said unto
him we are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept
back that we may not offer an offering of the lord in his appointed
season among the children of israel   and moses said unto them
stand still and i will hear what the lord will command concerning
you
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the
children of israel saying if any man of you or of your posterity
shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar
off yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord
the fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
they shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break any bone
of it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep
it
but the man that is clean and is not in a journey and
forbeareth to keep the passover even the same soul shall be cut off
from among his people because he brought not the offering of the lord
in his appointed season that man shall bear his sin
and if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the
passover unto the lord according to the ordinance of the passover
and according to the manner thereof so shall he do ye shall have one
ordinance both for the stranger and for him that was born in the
land
and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even
there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until
the morning
so it was alway the cloud covered it by day and the appearance
of fire by night
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then after
that the children of israel journeyed and in the place where the
cloud abode there the children of israel pitched their tents
at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyed
and at the commandment of the lord they pitched as long as the cloud
abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents
and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days
then the children of israel kept the charge of the lord and journeyed
not
and so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle
according to the commandment of the lord they abode in their tents
and according to the commandment of the lord they journeyed
and so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morning
and that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed
whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up they
journeyed
or whether it were two days or a month or a year that the
cloud tarried upon the tabernacle remaining thereon the children of
israel abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was taken
up they journeyed
at the commandment of the lord they rested in the tents and at
the commandment of the lord they journeyed they kept the charge of
the lord at the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying  make thee two
trumpets of silver of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thou
mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the
journeying of the camps
and when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall
assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation
and if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes which
are heads of the thousands of israel shall gather themselves unto
thee
when ye blow an alarm then the camps that lie on the east parts
shall go forward
when ye blow an alarm the second time then the camps that lie on
the south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm for
their journeys
but when the congregation is to be gathered together ye shall
blow but ye shall not sound an alarm
and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets
and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your
generations
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
oppresseth you then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and ye
shall be remembered before the lord your god and ye shall be saved
from your enemies
also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and
in the beginnings of your months ye shall blow with the trumpets over
your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings
that they may be to you for a memorial before your god i am the lord
your god
and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month in
the second year that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle
of the testimony
and the children of israel took their journeys out of the
wilderness of sinai and the cloud rested in the wilderness of paran
and they first took their journey according to the commandment
of the lord by the hand of moses
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children
of judah according to their armies and over his host was nahshon the
son of amminadab
and over the host of the tribe of the children of issachar was
nethaneel the son of zuar
and over the host of the tribe of the children of zebulun was
eliab the son of helon
and the tabernacle was taken down and the sons of gershon and
the sons of merari set forward bearing the tabernacle
and the standard of the camp of reuben set forward according to
their armies and over his host was elizur the son of shedeur
and over the host of the tribe of the children of simeon was
shelumiel the son of zurishaddai
and over the host of the tribe of the children of gad was
eliasaph the son of deuel
and the kohathites set forward bearing the sanctuary and the
other did set up the tabernacle against they came
and the standard of the camp of the children of ephraim set
forward according to their armies and over his host was elishama the
son of ammihud
and over the host of the tribe of the children of manasseh was
gamaliel the son of pedahzur
and over the host of the tribe of the children of benjamin was
abidan the son of gideoni
and the standard of the camp of the children of dan set forward
which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts and
over his host was ahiezer the son of ammishaddai
and over the host of the tribe of the children of asher was
pagiel the son of ocran
and over the host of the tribe of the children of naphtali was
ahira the son of enan
thus were the journeyings of the children of israel according to
their armies when they set forward
and moses said unto hobab the son of raguel the midianite
moses father in law we are journeying unto the place of which the
lord said i will give it you come thou with us and we will do thee
good for the lord hath spoken good concerning israel
and he said unto him i will not go but i will depart to mine
own land and to my kindred
and he said leave us not i pray thee forasmuch as thou
knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou mayest be to
us instead of eyes
and it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that what
goodness the lord shall do unto us the same will we do unto thee
and they departed from the mount of the lord three days
journey and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them in
the three days journey to search out a resting place for them
and the cloud of the lord was upon them by day when they went
out of the camp
and it came to pass when the ark set forward that moses said
rise up lord and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that
hate thee flee before thee
and when it rested he said return o lord unto the many
thousands of israel
and when the people complained it displeased the lord and the
lord heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the lord
burnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts
of the camp
and the people cried unto moses and when moses prayed unto the
lord the fire was quenched
and he called the name of the place taberah because the fire of
the lord burnt among them
and the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting and
the children of israel also wept again and said who shall give us
flesh to eat   we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt
freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions
and the garlick  but now our soul is dried away there is nothing
at all beside this manna before our eyes
and the manna was as coriander seed and the colour thereof as
the colour of bdellium
and the people went about and gathered it and ground it in
mills or beat it in a mortar and baked it in pans and made cakes of
it and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil
and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell
upon it
then moses heard the people weep throughout their families
every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the lord was
kindled greatly moses also was displeased
and moses said unto the lord wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
servant and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight that thou
layest the burden of all this people upon me   have i conceived
all this people have i begotten them that thou shouldest say unto
me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the sucking
child unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers
whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep
unto me saying give us flesh that we may eat
i am not able to bear all this people alone because it is too
heavy for me
and if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out of
hand if i have found favour in thy sight and let me not see my
wretchedness
and the lord said unto moses gather unto me seventy men of the
elders of israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people
and officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle of the
congregation that they may stand there with thee
and i will come down and talk with thee there and i will take
of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they
shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not
thyself alone
and say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against to
morrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the
lord saying who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with us
in egypt therefore the lord will give you flesh and ye shall eat
ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither
ten days nor twenty days  but even a whole month until it come
out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye
have despised the lord which is among you and have wept before him
saying why came we forth out of egypt   and moses said the
people among whom i am are six hundred thousand footmen and thou
hast said i will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month
shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice
them  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them
to suffice them   and the lord said unto moses is the lords
hand waxed short thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to
pass unto thee or not
and moses went out and told the people the words of the lord
and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them
round about the tabernacle
and the lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took
of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders
and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they
prophesied and did not cease
but there remained two of the men in the camp the name of the
one was eldad and the name of the other medad and the spirit rested
upon them and they were of them that were written but went not out
unto the tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp
and there ran a young man and told moses and said eldad and
medad do prophesy in the camp
and joshua the son of nun the servant of moses one of his
young men answered and said my lord moses forbid them
and moses said unto him enviest thou for my sake would god
that all the lords people were prophets and that the lord would put
his spirit upon them   and moses gat him into the camp he and
the elders of israel
and there went forth a wind from the lord and brought quails
from the sea and let them fall by the camp as it were a days
journey on this side and as it were a days journey on the other
side round about the camp and as it were two cubits high upon the
face of the earth
and the people stood up all that day and all that night and
all the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered least
gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves
round about the camp
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was
chewed the wrath of the lord was kindled against the people and the
lord smote the people with a very great plague
and he called the name of that place kibrothhattaavah because
there they buried the people that lusted
and the people journeyed from kibrothhattaavah unto hazeroth
and abode at hazeroth
and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopian
woman whom he had married for he had married an ethiopian woman
and they said hath the lord indeed spoken only by moses hath he
not spoken also by us and the lord heard it
now the man moses was very meek above all the men which were
upon the face of the earth   and the lord spake suddenly unto
moses and unto aaron and unto miriam come out ye three unto the
tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out
and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in
the door of the tabernacle and called aaron and miriam and they both
came forth
and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you
i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak
unto him in a dream
my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house
with him will i speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in
dark speeches and the similitude of the lord shall he behold
wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses
and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he
departed
and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and behold
miriam became leprous white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam
and behold she was leprous
and aaron said unto moses alas my lord i beseech thee lay
not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we
have sinned
let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed
when he cometh out of his mothers womb
and moses cried unto the lord saying heal her now o god i
beseech thee
and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her
face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from
the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again
and miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people
journeyed not till miriam was brought in again
and afterward the people removed from hazeroth and pitched in
the wilderness of paran
and the lord spake unto moses saying  send thou men that
they may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children of
israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one
a ruler among them
and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from the
wilderness of paran all those men were heads of the children of
israel
and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua the
son of zaccur
of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori
of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh
of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph
of the tribe of ephraim oshea the son of nun
of the tribe of benjamin palti the son of raphu
of the tribe of zebulun gaddiel the son of sodi
of the tribe of joseph namely of the tribe of manasseh gaddi
the son of susi
of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli
of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael
of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi
of the tribe of gad geuel the son of machi
these are the names of the men which moses sent to spy out the
land
and moses called oshea the son of nun jehoshua
and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto
them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain
and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth
therein whether they be strong or weak few or many  and what
the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what
cities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strong
holds  and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether
there be wood therein or not and be ye of good courage and bring of
the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the firstripe
grapes
so they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of
zin unto rehob as men come to hamath
and they ascended by the south and came unto hebron where
ahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were now hebron
was built seven years before zoan in egypt   and they came unto
the brook of eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with one
cluster of grapes and they bare it between two upon a staff and they
brought of the pomegranates and of the figs
the place was called the brook eshcol because of the cluster of
grapes which the children of israel cut down from thence
and they returned from searching of the land after forty days
and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the
congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran
to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the
congregation and shewed them the fruit of the land
and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou
sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the
fruit of it
nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and
the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the
children of anak there
the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites
and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the
canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan
and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go
up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it
but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up
against the people for they are stronger than we
and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which
we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great
stature
and there we saw the giants the sons of anak which come of the
giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were
in their sight
and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and
the people wept that night
and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against
aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we
had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in this
wilderness   and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this
land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be
a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt   and they
said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into
egypt
then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly
of the congregation of the children of israel
and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which
were of them that searched the land rent their clothes  and they
spake unto all the company of the children of israel saying the
land which we passed through to search it is an exceeding good land
if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land
and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey
only rebel not ye against the lord neither fear ye the people of
the land for they are bread for us their defence is departed from
them and the lord is with us fear them not
but all the congregation bade stone them with stones and the
glory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation
before all the children of israel
and the lord said unto moses how long will this people provoke
me  and how long will it be ere they believe me for all the signs
which i have shewed among them   i will smite them with the
pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a greater
nation and mightier than they
and moses said unto the lord then the egyptians shall hear it
for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them
and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they
have heard that thou lord art among this people that thou lord art
seen face to face and that thy cloud standeth over them and that
thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a
pillar of fire by night
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the
nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying
because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which
he sware unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness
and now i beseech thee let the power of my lord be great
according as thou hast spoken saying  the lord is
longsuffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity and
transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation
pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of this people according
unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this
people from egypt even until now
and the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word
but as truly as i live all the earth shall be filled with the glory
of the lord
because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles
which i did in egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now
these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice  surely they
shall not see the land which i sware unto their fathers neither shall
any of them that provoked me see it  but my servant caleb
because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully
him will i bring into the land whereinto he went and his seed shall
possess it
now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valley
tomorrow turn you and get you into the wilderness by the way of the
red sea
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying  how
long shall i bear with this evil congregation which murmur against
me i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which they
murmur against me
say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord as ye have
spoken in mine ears so will i do to you  your carcases shall
fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according
to your whole number from twenty years old and upward which have
murmured against me
doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which i
sware to make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jephunneh and
joshua the son of nun
but your little ones which ye said should be a prey them will
i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despised
but as for you your carcases they shall fall in this
wilderness
and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years
and bear your whoredoms until your carcases be wasted in the
wilderness
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land even
forty days each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities even
forty years and ye shall know my breach of promise
i the lord have said i will surely do it unto all this evil
congregation that are gathered together against me in this
wilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall die
and the men which moses sent to search the land who returned
and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a
slander upon the land  even those men that did bring up the evil
report upon the land died by the plague before the lord
but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which
were of the men that went to search the land lived still
and moses told these sayings unto all the children of israel
and the people mourned greatly
and they rose up early in the morning and gat them up into the
top of the mountain saying lo we be here and will go up unto the
place which the lord hath promised for we have sinned
and moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
of the lord but it shall not prosper
go not up for the lord is not among you that ye be not smitten
before your enemies
for the amalekites and the canaanites are there before you and
ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the lord
therefore the lord will not be with you
but they presumed to go up unto the hill top nevertheless the
ark of the covenant of the lord and moses departed not out of the
camp
then the amalekites came down and the canaanites which dwelt in
that hill and smote them and discomfited them even unto hormah
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the
children of israel and say unto them when ye be come into the land
of your habitations which i give unto you  and will make an
offering by fire unto the lord a burnt offering or a sacrifice in
performing a vow or in a freewill offering or in your solemn feasts
to make a sweet savour unto the lord of the herd or of the flock
then shall he that offereth his offering unto the lord bring a
meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of
an hin of oil
and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt
thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lamb
or for a ram thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil
and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an
hin of wine for a sweet savour unto the lord
and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering or for a
sacrifice in performing a vow or peace offerings unto the lord
then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth
deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil
and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine
for an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord
thus shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for a
lamb or a kid
according to the number that ye shall prepare so shall ye do to
every one according to their number
all that are born of the country shall do these things after
this manner in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet savour
unto the lord
and if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoever be among you in
your generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet
savour unto the lord as ye do so he shall do
one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation and
also for the stranger that sojourneth with you an ordinance for ever
in your generations as ye are so shall the stranger be before the
lord
one law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger
that sojourneth with you
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the
children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land
whither i bring you  then it shall be that when ye eat of the
bread of the land ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the lord
ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave
offering as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor so shall
ye heave it
of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the lord an heave
offering in your generations
and if ye have erred and not observed all these commandments
which the lord hath spoken unto moses  even all that the lord
hath commanded you by the hand of moses from the day that the lord
commanded moses and henceforward among your generations  then
it shall be if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge
of the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one young
bullock for a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the lord with
his meat offering and his drink offering according to the manner
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering
and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation
of the children of israel and it shall be forgiven them for it is
ignorance and they shall bring their offering a sacrifice made by
fire unto the lord and their sin offering before the lord for their
ignorance  and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the
children of israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them
seeing all the people were in ignorance
and if any soul sin through ignorance then he shall bring a she
goat of the first year for a sin offering
and the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth
ignorantly when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord to make an
atonement for him and it shall be forgiven him
ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance
both for him that is born among the children of israel and for the
stranger that sojourneth among them
but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously whether he be born
in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the lord and that
soul shall be cut off from among his people
because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken
his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity
shall be upon him
and while the children of israel were in the wilderness they
found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day
and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses
and aaron and unto all the congregation
and they put him in ward because it was not declared what
should be done to him
and the lord said unto moses the man shall be surely put to
death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the
camp
and all the congregation brought him without the camp and
stoned him with stones and he died as the lord commanded moses
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the
children of israel and bid them that they make them fringes in the
borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they
put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue  and it
shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember
all the commandments of the lord and do them and that ye seek not
after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to go a
whoring  that ye may remember and do all my commandments and
be holy unto your god
i am the lord your god which brought you out of the land of
egypt to be your god i am the lord your god
now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi
and dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of peleth
sons of reuben took men  and they rose up before moses with
certain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty princes of
the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown  and they
gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron and said
unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are
holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then
lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord   and
when moses heard it he fell upon his face  and he spake unto
korah and unto all his company saying even to morrow the lord will
shew who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near
unto him even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto
him
this do take you censers korah and all his company  and
put fire therein and put incense in them before the lord to morrow
and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose he shall be
holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi
and moses said unto korah hear i pray you ye sons of levi
seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the god of israel
hath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near
to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to
stand before the congregation to minister unto them   and he
hath brought thee near to him and all thy brethren the sons of levi
with thee and seek ye the priesthood also   for which cause
both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the lord
and what is aaron that ye murmur against him   and moses sent
to call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab which said we will not
come up  is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of
a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness
except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us   moreover
thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey
or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the
eyes of these men we will not come up
and moses was very wroth and said unto the lord respect not
thou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have
i hurt one of them
and moses said unto korah be thou and all thy company before
the lord thou and they and aaron to morrow  and take every
man his censer and put incense in them and bring ye before the lord
every man his censer two hundred and fifty censers thou also and
aaron each of you his censer
and they took every man his censer and put fire in them and
laid incense thereon and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation with moses and aaron
and korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the lord
appeared unto all the congregation
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying
separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume
them in a moment
and they fell upon their faces and said o god the god of the
spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with
all the congregation   and the lord spake unto moses saying
speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about the
tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram
and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the
elders of israel followed him
and he spake unto the congregation saying depart i pray you
from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest
ye be consumed in all their sins
so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram
on every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood in the door
of their tents and their wives and their sons and their little
children
and moses said hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me
to do all these works for i have not done them of mine own mind
if these men die the common death of all men or if they be
visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent
me
but if the lord make a new thing and the earth open her mouth
and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go
down quick into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have
provoked the lord
and it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these
words that the ground clave asunder that was under them  and
the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses
and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods
they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the
pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the
congregation
and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of
them for they said lest the earth swallow us up also
and there came out a fire from the lord and consumed the two
hundred and fifty men that offered incense
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto eleazar
the son of aaron the priest that he take up the censers out of the
burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are hallowed
the censers of these sinners against their own souls let them
make them broad plates for a covering of the altar for they offered
them before the lord therefore they are hallowed and they shall be a
sign unto the children of israel
and eleazar the priest took the brasen censers wherewith they
that were burnt had offered and they were made broad plates for a
covering of the altar  to be a memorial unto the children of
israel that no stranger which is not of the seed of aaron come near
to offer incense before the lord that he be not as korah and as his
company as the lord said to him by the hand of moses
but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel
murmured against moses and against aaron saying ye have killed the
people of the lord
and it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against
moses and against aaron that they looked toward the tabernacle of the
congregation and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the
lord appeared
and moses and aaron came before the tabernacle of the
congregation
and the lord spake unto moses saying  get you up from
among this congregation that i may consume them as in a moment and
they fell upon their faces
and moses said unto aaron take a censer and put fire therein
from off the altar and put on incense and go quickly unto the
congregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath gone
out from the lord the plague is begun
and aaron took as moses commanded and ran into the midst of the
congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and
he put on incense and made an atonement for the people
and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was
stayed
now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
seven hundred beside them that died about the matter of korah
and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation and the plague was stayed
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the
children of israel and take of every one of them a rod according to
the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the
house of their fathers twelve rods write thou every mans name upon
his rod
and thou shalt write aarons name upon the rod of levi for one
rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers
and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation
before the testimony where i will meet with you
and it shall come to pass that the mans rod whom i shall
choose shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmurings
of the children of israel whereby they murmur against you
and moses spake unto the children of israel and every one of
their princes gave him a rod apiece for each prince one according to
their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was
among their rods
and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle of
witness
and it came to pass that on the morrow moses went into the
tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of aaron for the house of
levi was budded and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and
yielded almonds
and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all
the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod
and the lord said unto moses bring aarons rod again before the
testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt
quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not
and moses did so as the lord commanded him so did he
and the children of israel spake unto moses saying behold we
die we perish we all perish
whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord
shall die shall we be consumed with dying   and the lord said
unto aaron thou and thy sons and thy fathers house with thee shall
bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee
shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood
and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi the tribe of thy
father bring thou with thee that they may be joined unto thee and
minister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister
before the tabernacle of witness
and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the
tabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary
and the altar that neither they nor ye also die
and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the
tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacle
and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you
and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of
the altar that there be no wrath any more upon the children of
israel
and i behold i have taken your brethren the levites from among
the children of israel to you they are given as a gift for the lord
to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priests
office for everything of the altar and within the vail and ye shall
serve i have given your priests office unto you as a service of
gift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death
and the lord spake unto aaron behold i also have given thee the
charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the
children of israel unto thee have i given them by reason of the
anointing and to thy sons by an ordinance for ever
this shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the
fire every oblation of theirs every meat offering of theirs and
every sin offering of theirs and every trespass offering of theirs
which they shall render unto me shall be most holy for thee and for
thy sons
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it every male shall eat
it it shall be holy unto thee
and this is thine the heave offering of their gift with all
the wave offerings of the children of israel i have given them unto
thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee by a statute for
ever every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it
all the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of
the wheat the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the
lord them have i given thee
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land which they shall bring
unto the lord shall be thine every one that is clean in thine house
shall eat of it
every thing devoted in israel shall be thine
every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh which they
bring unto the lord whether it be of men or beasts shall be thine
nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem and the
firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem
and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
redeem according to thine estimation for the money of five shekels
after the shekel of the sanctuary which is twenty gerahs
but the firstling of a cow or the firstling of a sheep or the
firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem they are holy thou shalt
sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shalt burn their fat for an
offering made by fire for a sweet savour unto the lord
and the flesh of them shall be thine as the wave breast and as
the right shoulder are thine
all the heave offerings of the holy things which the children
of israel offer unto the lord have i given thee and thy sons and thy
daughters with thee by a statute for ever it is a covenant of salt
for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee
and the lord spake unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in
their land neither shalt thou have any part among them i am thy part
and thine inheritance among the children of israel
and behold i have given the children of levi all the tenth in
israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even
the service of the tabernacle of the congregation
neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh the
tabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and die
but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a
statute for ever throughout your generations that among the children
of israel they have no inheritance
but the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as an
heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherit
therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they
shall have no inheritance
and the lord spake unto moses saying  thus speak unto the
levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the
tithes which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye
shall offer up an heave offering of it for the lord even a tenth part
of the tithe
and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as
though it were the corn of the threshingfloor and as the fulness of
the winepress
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all
your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and ye shall
give thereof the lords heave offering to aaron the priest
out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the
lord of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of
it
therefore thou shalt say unto them when ye have heaved the best
thereof from it then it shall be counted unto the levites as the
increase of the threshingfloor and as the increase of the winepress
and ye shall eat it in every place ye and your households for
it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the
congregation
and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it when ye have heaved
from it the best of it neither shall ye pollute the holy things of
the children of israel lest ye die
and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying  this
is the ordinance of the law which the lord hath commanded saying
speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer
without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke
and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest that he may bring
her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face
and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger
and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the
congregation seven times  and one shall burn the heifer in his
sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he
burn  and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and
scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer
then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his
flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the
priest shall be unclean until the even
and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and
bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the even
and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer
and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be
kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of
separation it is a purification for sin
and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the
children of israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them
for a statute for ever
he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven
days
he shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the
seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third
day then the seventh day he shall not be clean
whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead and
purifieth not himself defileth the tabernacle of the lord and that
soul shall be cut off from israel because the water of separation was
not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet
upon him
this is the law when a man dieth in a tent all that come into
the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days
and every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is
unclean
and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the
open fields or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be
unclean seven days
and for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the
burnt heifer of purification for sin and running water shall be put
thereto in a vessel  and a clean person shall take hyssop and
dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the
vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon him that
touched a bone or one slain or one dead or a grave  and the
clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on
the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify himself and
wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at
even
but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself
that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation because he
hath defiled the sanctuary of the lord the water of separation hath
not been sprinkled upon him he is unclean
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them that he that
sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes and he that
toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even
and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and
the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even
then came the children of israel even the whole congregation
into the desert of zin in the first month and the people abode in
kadesh and miriam died there and was buried there
and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered
themselves together against moses and against aaron
and the people chode with moses and spake saying would god
that we had died when our brethren died before the lord   and why
have ye brought up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness
that we and our cattle should die there   and wherefore have ye
made us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto this evil place
it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates
neither is there any water to drink
and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon
their faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them
and the lord spake unto moses saying  take the rod and
gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother and
speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his
water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so
thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink
and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him
and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before
the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels must we fetch
you water out of this rock   and moses lifted up his hand and
with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out
abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron because ye believed me
not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore
ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have given
them
this is the water of meribah because the children of israel
strove with the lord and he was sanctified in them
and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom
thus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath
befallen us  how our fathers went down into egypt and we have
dwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians vexed us and our
fathers  and when we cried unto the lord he heard our voice
and sent an angel and hath brought us forth out of egypt and
behold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border
let us pass i pray thee through thy country we will not pass
through the fields or through the vineyards neither will we drink of
the water of the wells we will go by the kings high way we will not
turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy
borders
and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass by me lest i come
out against thee with the sword
and the children of israel said unto him we will go by the high
way and if i and my cattle drink of thy water then i will pay for
it i will only without doing anything else go through on my feet
and he said thou shalt not go through and edom came out
against him with much people and with a strong hand
thus edom refused to give israel passage through his border
wherefore israel turned away from him
and the children of israel even the whole congregation
journeyed from kadesh and came unto mount hor
and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the
coast of the land of edom saying  aaron shall be gathered unto
his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given
unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at
the water of meribah
take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount
hor  and strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar
his son and aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die
there
and moses did as the lord commanded and they went up into mount
hor in the sight of all the congregation
and moses stripped aaron of his garments and put them upon
eleazar his son and aaron died there in the top of the mount and
moses and eleazar came down from the mount
and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead they
mourned for aaron thirty days even all the house of israel
and when king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south heard
tell that israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against
israel and took some of them prisoners
and israel vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt
indeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroy
their cities
and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered up
the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and
he called the name of the place hormah
and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea to
compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much
discouraged because of the way
and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore
have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there
is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this
light bread
and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit
the people and much people of israel died
therefore the people came to moses and said we have sinned for
we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lord
that he take away the serpents from us and moses prayed for the
people
and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set
it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is
bitten when he looketh upon it shall live
and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it
came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the
serpent of brass he lived
and the children of israel set forward and pitched in oboth
and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ijeabarim in the
wilderness which is before moab toward the sunrising
from thence they removed and pitched in the valley of zared
from thence they removed and pitched on the other side of
arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the
amorites for arnon is the border of moab between moab and the
amorites
wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord what
he did in the red sea and in the brooks of arnon  and at the
stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar and lieth
upon the border of moab
and from thence they went to beer that is the well whereof the
lord spake unto moses gather the people together and i will give
them water
then israel sang this song spring up o well sing ye unto it
the princes digged the well the nobles of the people digged it
by the direction of the lawgiver with their staves and from the
wilderness they went to mattanah  and from mattanah to nahaliel
and from nahaliel to bamoth  and from bamoth in the valley that
is in the country of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh toward
jeshimon
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites
saying  let me pass through thy land we will not turn into the
fields or into the vineyards we will not drink of the waters of the
well but we will go along by the kings high way until we be past
thy borders
and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border
but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against
israel into the wilderness and he came to jahaz and fought against
israel
and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed
his land from arnon unto jabbok even unto the children of ammon for
the border of the children of ammon was strong
and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the
cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the villages thereof
for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who
had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out
of his hand even unto arnon
wherefore they that speak in proverbs say come into heshbon
let the city of sihon be built and prepared  for there is a fire
gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath consumed
ar of moab and the lords of the high places of arnon
woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hath
given his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity unto
sihon king of the amorites
we have shot at them heshbon is perished even unto dibon and
we have laid them waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba
thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites
and moses sent to spy out jaazer and they took the villages
thereof and drove out the amorites that were there
and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the
king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to the
battle at edrei
and the lord said unto moses fear him not for i have delivered
him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do
to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at
heshbon
so they smote him and his sons and all his people until there
was none left him alive and they possessed his land
and the children of israel set forward and pitched in the plains
of moab on this side jordan by jericho
and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the
amorites
and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many
and moab was distressed because of the children of israel
and moab said unto the elders of midian now shall this company
lick up all that are round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of
the field
and balak the son of zippor was king of the moabites at that time
he sent messengers therefore unto balaam the son of beor to
pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of his
people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from
egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over
against me  come now therefore i pray thee curse me this
people for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevail
that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for
i wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest
is cursed
and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the
rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam and
spake unto him the words of balak
and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring
you word again as the lord shall speak unto me and the princes of
moab abode with balaam
and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee
and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab
hath sent unto me saying  behold there is a people come out of
egypt which covereth the face of the earth come now curse me them
peradventure i shall be able to overcome them and drive them out
and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou
shalt not curse the people for they are blessed
and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of
balak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave
to go with you
and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and
said balaam refuseth to come with us
and balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than
they
and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak the
son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto
me  for i will promote thee unto very great honour and i will
do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore i pray thee curse
me this people
and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if
balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go
beyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more
now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i
may know what the lord will say unto me more
and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men
come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which i
shall say unto thee that shalt thou do
and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went
with the princes of moab
and gods anger was kindled because he went and the angel of
the lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was
riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him
and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and
his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way
and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into
the way
but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards a
wall being on this side and a wall on that side
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she thrust herself
unto the wall and crushed balaams foot against the wall and he
smote her again
and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow
place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the
left
and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she fell down under
balaam and balaams anger was kindled and he smote the ass with a
staff
and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto
balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these
three times   and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast
mocked me i would there were a sword in mine hand for now would i
kill thee
and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon which
thou hast ridden ever since i was thine unto this day was i ever wont
to do so unto thee and he said nay
then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of
the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he
bowed down his head and fell flat on his face
and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thou
smitten thine ass these three times behold i went out to withstand
thee because thy way is perverse before me  and the ass saw me
and turned from me these three times unless she had turned from me
surely now also i had slain thee and saved her alive
and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned for i
knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if
it displease thee i will get me back again
and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men but
only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak so
balaam went with the princes of balak
and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet
him unto a city of moab which is in the border of arnon which is in
the utmost coast
and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestly send unto thee
to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeed
to promote thee to honour   and balaam said unto balak lo i am
come unto thee have i now any power at all to say any thing the word
that god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak
and balaam went with balak and they came unto kirjathhuzoth
and balak offered oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to the
princes that were with him
and it came to pass on the morrow that balak took balaam and
brought him up into the high places of baal that thence he might see
the utmost part of the people
and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and
prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams
and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered
on every altar a bullock and a ram
and balaam said unto balak stand by thy burnt offering and i
will go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he
sheweth me i will tell thee and he went to an high place
and god met balaam and he said unto him i have prepared seven
altars and i have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram
and the lord put a word in balaams mouth and said return unto
balak and thus thou shalt speak
and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt
sacrifice he and all the princes of moab
and he took up his parable and said balak the king of moab hath
brought me from aram out of the mountains of the east saying come
curse me jacob and come defy israel
how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed or how shall i defy
whom the lord hath not defied   for from the top of the rocks i
see him and from the hills i behold him lo the people shall dwell
alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations
who can count the dust of jacob and the number of the fourth
part of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let my last
end be like his   and balak said unto balaam what hast thou
done unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou
hast blessed them altogether
and he answered and said must i not take heed to speak that
which the lord hath put in my mouth   and balak said unto him
come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest
see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not
see them all and curse me them from thence
and he brought him into the field of zophim to the top of
pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on
every altar
and he said unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering while
i meet the lord yonder
and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said
go again unto balak and say thus
and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering
and the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what hath
the lord spoken   and he took up his parable and said rise up
balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of zippor  god is not
a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should
repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and
shall he not make it good   behold i have received commandment
to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it
he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath he seen
perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shout of
a king is among them
god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strength
of an unicorn
surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither is there
any divination against israel according to this time it shall be said
of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought   behold the
people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young
lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the
blood of the slain
and balak said unto balaam neither curse them at all nor bless
them at all
but balaam answered and said unto balak told not i thee
saying all that the lord speaketh that i must do   and balak
said unto balaam come i pray thee i will bring thee unto another
place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them
from thence
and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor that looketh
toward jeshimon
and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and
prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams
and balak did as balaam had said and offered a bullock and a
ram on every altar
and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he
went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his
face toward the wilderness
and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel abiding in his
tents according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him
and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath
said and the man whose eyes are open hath said  he hath said
which heard the words of god which saw the vision of the almighty
falling into a trance but having his eyes open  how goodly are
thy tents o jacob and thy tabernacles o israel   as the
valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the rivers side as the
trees of lign aloes which the lord hath planted and as cedar trees
beside the waters
he shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be
in many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and his
kingdom shall be exalted
god brought him forth out of egypt he hath as it were the
strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies and
shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows
he couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shall
stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that
curseth thee
and balaks anger was kindled against balaam and he smote his
hands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to curse
mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these
three times
therefore now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote thee
unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour
and balaam said unto balak spake i not also to thy messengers
which thou sentest unto me saying  if balak would give me his
house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the commandment of
the lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the lord
saith that will i speak   and now behold i go unto my people
come therefore and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to
thy people in the latter days
and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor
hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said  he hath
said which heard the words of god and knew the knowledge of the most
high which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but
having his eyes open  i shall see him but not now i shall
behold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of jacob and a
sceptre shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab
and destroy all the children of sheth
and edom shall be a possession seir also shall be a possession
for his enemies and israel shall do valiantly
out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shall
destroy him that remaineth of the city
and when he looked on amalek he took up his parable and said
amalek was the first of the nations but his latter end shall be that
he perish for ever
and he looked on the kenites and took up his parable and said
strong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rock
nevertheless the kenite shall be wasted until asshur shall
carry thee away captive
and he took up his parable and said alas who shall live when
god doeth this   and ships shall come from the coast of chittim
and shall afflict asshur and shall afflict eber and he also shall
perish for ever
and balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and
balak also went his way
and israel abode in shittim and the people began to commit
whoredom with the daughters of moab
and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and
the people did eat and bowed down to their gods
and israel joined himself unto baalpeor and the anger of the
lord was kindled against israel
and the lord said unto moses take all the heads of the people
and hang them up before the lord against the sun that the fierce
anger of the lord may be turned away from israel
and moses said unto the judges of israel slay ye every one his
men that were joined unto baalpeor
and behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto
his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in the
sight of all the congregation of the children of israel who were
weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
and when phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the
priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a
javelin in his hand  and he went after the man of israel into the
tent and thrust both of them through the man of israel and the
woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of
israel
and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand
and the lord spake unto moses saying  phinehas the son
of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away
from the children of israel while he was zealous for my sake among
them that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy
wherefore say behold i give unto him my covenant of peace
and he shall have it and his seed after him even the covenant
of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his god and
made an atonement for the children of israel
now the name of the israelite that was slain even that was
slain with the midianitish woman was zimri the son of salu a prince
of a chief house among the simeonites
and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain was cozbi
the daughter of zur he was head over a people and of a chief house
in midian
and the lord spake unto moses saying  vex the midianites
and smite them  for they vex you with their wiles wherewith
they have beguiled you in the matter of peor and in the matter of
cozbi the daughter of a prince of midian their sister which was
slain in the day of the plague for peors sake
and it came to pass after the plague that the lord spake unto
moses and unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest saying  take
the sum of all the congregation of the children of israel from twenty
years old and upward throughout their fathers house all that are
able to go to war in israel

these are they that were numbered by moses and eleazar the
priest who numbered the children of israel in the plains of moab by
jordan near jericho
but among these there was not a man of them whom moses and aaron
the priest numbered when they numbered the children of israel in the

and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying if a
man die and have no son then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass
unto his daughter

abarim and see the land which i have given unto the children of

the strife of the congregation to sanctify me at the water before
their eyes that is the water of meribah in kadesh in the wilderness
of zin
and moses spake unto the lord saying  let the lord the
god of the spirits of all flesh set a man over the congregation
which may go out before them and which may go in before them
and which may lead them out and which may bring them in that the
congregation of the lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd

and all the children of israel with him even all the congregation

they have bound their souls shall stand against her
and if she vowed in her husbands house or bound her soul by a
bond with an oath  and her husband heard it and held his peace
at her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and
every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
but if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
heard them then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her
vows or concerning the bond of her soul shall not stand her husband
hath made them void and the lord shall forgive her
every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul her
husband may establish it or her husband may make it void
but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to
day then he establisheth all her vows or all her bonds which are
upon her he confirmeth them because he held his peace at her in the
day that he heard them
but if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard
them then he shall bear her iniquity
these are the statutes which the lord commanded moses between
a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in
her youth in her fathers house
and the lord spake unto moses saying  avenge the children
of israel of the midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy
people
and moses spake unto the people saying arm some of yourselves
unto the war and let them go against the midianites and avenge the
lord of midian
of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of israel
shall ye send to the war
so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel a
thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war
and moses sent them to the war a thousand of every tribe them
and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the war with the holy
instruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand
and they warred against the midianites as the lord commanded
moses and they slew all the males
and they slew the kings of midian beside the rest of them that
were slain namely evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba five
kings of midian balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword
and the children of israel took all the women of midian captives
and their little ones and took the spoil of all their cattle and all
their flocks and all their goods
and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and all
their goodly castles with fire
and they took all the spoil and all the prey both of men and
of beasts
and they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto
moses and eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the
children of israel unto the camp at the plains of moab which are by
jordan near jericho
and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the
congregation went forth to meet them without the camp
and moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the
captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from
the battle
and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive
behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel
of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor
and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord
now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill
every woman that hath known man by lying with him
but all the women children that have not known a man by lying
with him keep alive for yourselves
and do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hath
killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify both
yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day
and purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins and
all work of goats hair and all things made of wood
and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to
the battle this is the ordinance of the law which the lord commanded
moses  only the gold and the silver the brass the iron the
tin and the lead  every thing that may abide the fire ye shall
make it go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it
shall be purified with the water of separation and all that abideth
not the fire ye shall make go through the water
and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall
be clean and afterward ye shall come into the camp
and the lord spake unto moses saying  take the sum of the
prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and eleazar the
priest and the chief fathers of the congregation  and divide
the prey into two parts between them that took the war upon them who
went out to battle and between all the congregation  and levy a
tribute unto the lord of the men of war which went out to battle one
soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of
the asses and of the sheep  take it of their half and give it
unto eleazar the priest for an heave offering of the lord
and of the children of israels half thou shalt take one
portion of fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of
the flocks of all manner of beasts and give them unto the levites
which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord
and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded
moses
and the booty being the rest of the prey which the men of war
had caught was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five
thousand sheep  and threescore and twelve thousand beeves
and threescore and one thousand asses  and thirty and two
thousand persons in all of women that had not known man by lying with
him
and the half which was the portion of them that went out to
war was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty
thousand and five hundred sheep  and the lords tribute of the
sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen
and the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the lords
tribute was threescore and twelve
and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which
the lords tribute was threescore and one
and the persons were sixteen thousand of which the lords
tribute was thirty and two persons
and moses gave the tribute which was the lords heave offering
unto eleazar the priest as the lord commanded moses
and of the children of israels half which moses divided from
the men that warred  now the half that pertained unto the
congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven
thousand and five hundred sheep  and thirty and six thousand
beeves  and thirty thousand asses and five hundred  and
sixteen thousand persons  even of the children of israels
half moses took one portion of fifty both of man and of beast and
gave them unto the levites which kept the charge of the tabernacle of
the lord as the lord commanded moses
and the officers which were over thousands of the host the
captains of thousands and captains of hundreds came near unto moses
and they said unto moses thy servants have taken the sum of the
men of war which are under our charge and there lacketh not one man
of us
we have therefore brought an oblation for the lord what every
man hath gotten of jewels of gold chains and bracelets rings
earrings and tablets to make an atonement for our souls before the
lord
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all
wrought jewels
and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the
lord of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds
was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels
for the men of war had taken spoil every man for himself
and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains
of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle of
the congregation for a memorial for the children of israel before the
lord
now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very
great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and
the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle
the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spake
unto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the
congregation saying  ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrah
and heshbon and elealeh and shebam and nebo and beon  even
the country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is
a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle  wherefore said
they if we have found grace in thy sight let this land be given unto
thy servants for a possession and bring us not over jordan
and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of
reuben shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit here
and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of israel from
going over into the land which the lord hath given them   thus
did your fathers when i sent them from kadeshbarnea to see the land
for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw the
land they discouraged the heart of the children of israel that they
should not go into the land which the lord had given them
and the lords anger was kindled the same time and he sware
saying  surely none of the men that came up out of egypt from
twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i sware unto
abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly
followed me  save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite and
joshua the son of nun for they have wholly followed the lord
and the lords anger was kindled against israel and he made
them wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generation
that had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed
and behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead an increase
of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward
israel
for if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them
in the wilderness and ye shall destroy all this people
and they came near unto him and said we will build sheepfolds
here for our cattle and cities for our little ones  but we
ourselves will go ready armed before the children of israel until we
have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in
the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land
we will not return unto our houses until the children of israel
have inherited every man his inheritance
for we will not inherit with them on yonder side jordan or
forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side jordan
eastward
and moses said unto them if ye will do this thing if ye will
go armed before the lord to war  and will go all of you armed
over jordan before the lord until he hath driven out his enemies from
before him  and the land be subdued before the lord then
afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the lord and
before israel and this land shall be your possession before the lord
but if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against the
lord and be sure your sin will find you out
build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep
and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth
and the children of gad and the children of reuben spake unto
moses saying thy servants will do as my lord commandeth
our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle
shall be there in the cities of gilead  but thy servants will
pass over every man armed for war before the lord to battle as my
lord saith
so concerning them moses commanded eleazar the priest and
joshua the son of nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of the
children of israel  and moses said unto them if the children of
gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over jordan every
man armed to battle before the lord and the land shall be subdued
before you then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a
possession  but if they will not pass over with you armed they
shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan
and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered
saying as the lord hath said unto thy servants so will we do
we will pass over armed before the lord into the land of canaan
that the possession of our inheritance on this side jordan may be
ours
and moses gave unto them even to the children of gad and to
the children of reuben and unto half the tribe of manasseh the son of
joseph the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites and the kingdom of
og king of bashan the land with the cities thereof in the coasts
even the cities of the country round about
and the children of gad built dibon and ataroth and aroer
and atroth shophan and jaazer and jogbehah  and
bethnimrah and bethharan fenced cities and folds for sheep
and the children of reuben built heshbon and elealeh and
kirjathaim  and nebo and baalmeon their names being changed
and shibmah and gave other names unto the cities which they builded
and the children of machir the son of manasseh went to gilead
and took it and dispossessed the amorite which was in it
and moses gave gilead unto machir the son of manasseh and he
dwelt therein
and jair the son of manasseh went and took the small towns
thereof and called them havothjair
and nobah went and took kenath and the villages thereof and
called it nobah after his own name
these are the journeys of the children of israel which went
forth out of the land of egypt with their armies under the hand of
moses and aaron
and moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by
the commandment of the lord and these are their journeys according to
their goings out
and they departed from rameses in the first month on the
fifteenth day of the first month on the morrow after the passover the
children of israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the
egyptians
for the egyptians buried all their firstborn which the lord had
smitten among them upon their gods also the lord executed judgments
and the children of israel removed from rameses and pitched in
succoth
and they departed from succoth and pitched in etham which is in
the edge of the wilderness
and they removed from etham and turned again unto pihahiroth
which is before baalzephon and they pitched before migdol
and they departed from before pihahiroth and passed through the
midst of the sea into the wilderness and went three days journey in
the wilderness of etham and pitched in marah

twelve fountains of water and threescore and ten palm trees and they
pitched there

wilderness of sin
and they took their journey out of the wilderness of sin and
encamped in dophkah
and they departed from dophkah and encamped in alush
and they removed from alush and encamped at rephidim where was
no water for the people to drink
and they departed from rephidim and pitched in the wilderness
of sinai
and they removed from the desert of sinai and pitched at
kibrothhattaavah
and they departed from kibrothhattaavah and encamped at
hazeroth
and they departed from hazeroth and pitched in rithmah
and they departed from rithmah and pitched at rimmonparez
and they departed from rimmonparez and pitched in libnah
and they removed from libnah and pitched at rissah
and they journeyed from rissah and pitched in kehelathah
and they went from kehelathah and pitched in mount shapher
and they removed from mount shapher and encamped in haradah
and they removed from haradah and pitched in makheloth
and they removed from makheloth and encamped at tahath
and they departed from tahath and pitched at tarah
and they removed from tarah and pitched in mithcah
and they went from mithcah and pitched in hashmonah
and they departed from hashmonah and encamped at moseroth
and they departed from moseroth and pitched in benejaakan
and they removed from benejaakan and encamped at horhagidgad
and they went from horhagidgad and pitched in jotbathah
and they removed from jotbathah and encamped at ebronah
and they departed from ebronah and encamped at eziongaber
and they removed from eziongaber and pitched in the wilderness
of zin which is kadesh
and they removed from kadesh and pitched in mount hor in the
edge of the land of edom
and aaron the priest went up into mount hor at the commandment
of the lord and died there in the fortieth year after the children
of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the first day of the
fifth month
and aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he
died in mount hor
and king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south in the
land of canaan heard of the coming of the children of israel
and they departed from mount hor and pitched in zalmonah
and they departed from zalmonah and pitched in punon
and they departed from punon and pitched in oboth
and they departed from oboth and pitched in ijeabarim in the
border of moab
and they departed from iim and pitched in dibongad
and they removed from dibongad and encamped in almondiblathaim
and they removed from almondiblathaim and pitched in the
mountains of abarim before nebo
and they departed from the mountains of abarim and pitched in
the plains of moab by jordan near jericho
and they pitched by jordan from bethjesimoth even unto
abelshittim in the plains of moab
and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan
near jericho saying  speak unto the children of israel and say
unto them when ye are passed over jordan into the land of canaan
then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from
before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their
molten images and quite pluck down all their high places  and
ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein
for i have given you the land to possess it
and ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among
your families and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance and
to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance every mans
inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to
the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit
but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from
before you then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain
of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and
shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell
moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you as i
thought to do unto them
and the lord spake unto moses saying  command the children
of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land of canaan
this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance even
the land of canaan with the coasts thereof  then your south
quarter shall be from the wilderness of zin along by the coast of
edom and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea
eastward  and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent
of akrabbim and pass on to zin and the going forth thereof shall be
from the south to kadeshbarnea and shall go on to hazaraddar and
pass on to azmon  and the border shall fetch a compass from azmon
unto the river of egypt and the goings out of it shall be at the sea
and as for the western border ye shall even have the great sea
for a border this shall be your west border
and this shall be your north border from the great sea ye shall
point out for you mount hor  from mount hor ye shall point out
your border unto the entrance of hamath and the goings forth of the
border shall be to zedad  and the border shall go on to ziphron
and the goings out of it shall be at hazarenan this shall be your
north border
and ye shall point out your east border from hazarenan to
shepham  and the coast shall go down from shepham to riblah on
the east side of ain and the border shall descend and shall reach
unto the side of the sea of chinnereth eastward  and the border
shall go down to jordan and the goings out of it shall be at the salt
sea this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about
and moses commanded the children of israel saying this is the
land which ye shall inherit by lot which the lord commanded to give
unto the nine tribes and to the half tribe  for the tribe of
the children of reuben according to the house of their fathers and
the tribe of the children of gad according to the house of their
fathers have received their inheritance and half the tribe of
manasseh have received their inheritance  the two tribes and the
half tribe have received their inheritance on this side jordan near
jericho eastward toward the sunrising
and the lord spake unto moses saying  these are the names
of the men which shall divide the land unto you eleazar the priest
and joshua the son of nun
and ye shall take one prince of every tribe to divide the land
by inheritance
and the names of the men are these of the tribe of judah caleb
the son of jephunneh
and of the tribe of the children of simeon shemuel the son of
ammihud
of the tribe of benjamin elidad the son of chislon
and the prince of the tribe of the children of dan bukki the
son of jogli
the prince of the children of joseph for the tribe of the
children of manasseh hanniel the son of ephod
and the prince of the tribe of the children of ephraim kemuel
the son of shiphtan
and the prince of the tribe of the children of zebulun
elizaphan the son of parnach
and the prince of the tribe of the children of issachar paltiel
the son of azzan
and the prince of the tribe of the children of asher ahihud the
son of shelomi
and the prince of the tribe of the children of naphtali pedahel
the son of ammihud
these are they whom the lord commanded to divide the inheritance
unto the children of israel in the land of canaan
and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan
near jericho saying  command the children of israel that they
give unto the levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to
dwell in and ye shall give also unto the levites suburbs for the
cities round about them
and the cities shall they have to dwell in and the suburbs of
them shall be for their cattle and for their goods and for all their
beasts
and the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give unto the
levites shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand
cubits round about
and ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two
thousand cubits and on the south side two thousand cubits and on the
west side two thousand cubits and on the north side two thousand
cubits and the city shall be in the midst this shall be to them the
suburbs of the cities
and among the cities which ye shall give unto the levites there
shall be six cities for refuge which ye shall appoint for the
manslayer that he may flee thither and to them ye shall add forty
and two cities
so all the cities which ye shall give to the levites shall be
forty and eight cities them shall ye give with their suburbs
and the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of
the children of israel from them that have many ye shall give many
but from them that have few ye shall give few every one shall give of
his cities unto the levites according to his inheritance which he
inheriteth
and the lord spake unto moses saying  speak unto the
children of israel and say unto them when ye be come over jordan
into the land of canaan  then ye shall appoint you cities to be
cities of refuge for you that the slayer may flee thither which
killeth any person at unawares
and they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger
that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation in
judgment
and of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have
for refuge
ye shall give three cities on this side jordan and three cities
shall ye give in the land of canaan which shall be cities of refuge
these six cities shall be a refuge both for the children of
israel and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them that
every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither
and if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die
he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death
and if he smite him with throwing a stone wherewith he may die
and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to
death
or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood wherewith he may
die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to
death
the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer when he
meeteth him he shall slay him
but if he thrust him of hatred or hurl at him by laying of
wait that he die  or in enmity smite him with his hand that he
die he that smote him shall surely be put to death for he is a
murderer the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he
meeteth him
but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity or have cast upon
him any thing without laying of wait  or with any stone
wherewith a man may die seeing him not and cast it upon him that he
die and was not his enemy neither sought his harm  then the
congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood
according to these judgments  and the congregation shall deliver
the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood and the
congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge whither he
was fled and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest
which was anointed with the holy oil
but if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of
the city of his refuge whither he was fled  and the revenger of
blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge and the
revenger of blood kill the slayer he shall not be guilty of blood
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until
the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest
the slayer shall return into the land of his possession
so these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you
throughout your generations in all your dwellings
whoso killeth any person the murderer shall be put to death by
the mouth of witnesses but one witness shall not testify against any
person to cause him to die
moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a
murderer which is guilty of death but he shall be surely put to
death
and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the
city of his refuge that he should come again to dwell in the land
until the death of the priest
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it
defileth the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that
is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it
defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit wherein i
dwell for i the lord dwell among the children of israel
and the chief fathers of the families of the children of gilead
the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of the sons of
joseph came near and spake before moses and before the princes the
chief fathers of the children of israel  and they said the lord
commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the
children of israel and my lord was commanded by the lord to give the
inheritance of zelophehad our brother unto his daughters
and if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of
the children of israel then shall their inheritance be taken from the
inheritance of our fathers and shall be put to the inheritance of the
tribe whereunto they are received so shall it be taken from the lot
of our inheritance
and when the jubile of the children of israel shall be then
shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe
whereunto they are received so shall their inheritance be taken away
from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers
and moses commanded the children of israel according to the word
of the lord saying the tribe of the sons of joseph hath said well
this is the thing which the lord doth command concerning the
daughters of zelophehad saying let them marry to whom they think
best only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they
marry
so shall not the inheritance of the children of israel remove
from tribe to tribe for every one of the children of israel shall
keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers
and every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe
of the children of israel shall be wife unto one of the family of the
tribe of her father that the children of israel may enjoy every man
the inheritance of his fathers
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another
tribe but every one of the tribes of the children of israel shall
keep himself to his own inheritance
even as the lord commanded moses so did the daughters of
zelophehad  for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and
noah the daughters of zelophehad were married unto their fathers
brothers sons  and they were married into the families of the
sons of manasseh the son of joseph and their inheritance remained in
the tribe of the family of their father
these are the commandments and the judgments which the lord
commanded by the hand of moses unto the children of israel in the
plains of moab by jordan near jericho
the fifth book of moses  called deuteronomy
these be the words which moses spake unto all israel on this side
jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the red sea
between paran and tophel and laban and hazeroth and dizahab
there are eleven days journey from horeb by the way of mount
seir unto kadeshbarnea   and it came to pass in the fortieth
year in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that moses
spake unto the children of israel according unto all that the lord
had given him in commandment unto them  after he had slain sihon
the king of the amorites which dwelt in heshbon and og the king of
bashan which dwelt at astaroth in edrei  on this side jordan in
the land of moab began moses to declare this law saying  the
lord our god spake unto us in horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough
in this mount  turn you and take your journey and go to the
mount of the amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto in the
plain in the hills and in the vale and in the south and by the sea
side to the land of the canaanites and unto lebanon unto the great
river the river euphrates
behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the land
which the lord sware unto your fathers abraham isaac and jacob to
give unto them and to their seed after them
and i spake unto you at that time saying i am not able to bear
you myself alone  the lord your god hath multiplied you and
behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude
the lord god of your fathers make you a thousand times so many
more as ye are and bless you as he hath promised you   how can
i myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife
take you wise men and understanding and known among your
tribes and i will make them rulers over you
and ye answered me and said the thing which thou hast spoken is
good for us to do
so i took the chief of your tribes wise men and known and made
them heads over you captains over thousands and captains over
hundreds and captains over fifties and captains over tens and
officers among your tribes
and i charged your judges at that time saying hear the causes
between your brethren and judge righteously between every man and his
brother and the stranger that is with him
ye shall not respect persons in judgment but ye shall hear the
small as well as the great ye shall not be afraid of the face of man
for the judgment is gods and the cause that is too hard for you
bring it unto me and i will hear it
and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should
do
and when we departed from horeb we went through all that great
and terrible wilderness which ye saw by the way of the mountain of
the amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came to
kadeshbarnea
and i said unto you ye are come unto the mountain of the
amorites which the lord our god doth give unto us
behold the lord thy god hath set the land before thee go up and
possess it as the lord god of thy fathers hath said unto thee fear
not neither be discouraged
and ye came near unto me every one of you and said we will send
men before us and they shall search us out the land and bring us
word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall
come
and the saying pleased me well and i took twelve men of you one
of a tribe  and they turned and went up into the mountain and
came unto the valley of eshcol and searched it out
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and
brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said it is a
good land which the lord our god doth give us
notwithstanding ye would not go up but rebelled against the
commandment of the lord your god  and ye murmured in your tents
and said because the lord hated us he hath brought us forth out of
the land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to
destroy us
whither shall we go up our brethren have discouraged our heart
saying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are great
and walled up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of the
anakims there
then i said unto you dread not neither be afraid of them
the lord your god which goeth before you he shall fight for you
according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes
and in the wilderness where thou hast seen how that the lord thy god
bare thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that ye went
until ye came into this place
yet in this thing ye did not believe the lord your god  who
went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your
tents in in fire by night to shew you by what way ye should go and
in a cloud by day
and the lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and
sware saying  surely there shall not one of these men of this
evil generation see that good land which i sware to give unto your
fathers
save caleb the son of jephunneh he shall see it and to him will
i give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his children
because he hath wholly followed the lord
also the lord was angry with me for your sakes saying thou also
shalt not go in thither
but joshua the son of nun which standeth before thee he shall
go in thither encourage him for he shall cause israel to inherit it
moreover your little ones which ye said should be a prey and
your children which in that day had no knowledge between good and
evil they shall go in thither and unto them will i give it and they
shall possess it
but as for you turn you and take your journey into the
wilderness by the way of the red sea
then ye answered and said unto me we have sinned against the
lord we will go up and fight according to all that the lord our god
commanded us
and when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war ye were ready
to go up into the hill
and the lord said unto me say unto them go not up neither
fight for i am not among you lest ye be smitten before your enemies
so i spake unto you and ye would not hear but rebelled against
the commandment of the lord and went presumptuously up into the hill
and the amorites which dwelt in that mountain came out against
you and chased you as bees do and destroyed you in seir even unto
hormah
and ye returned and wept before the lord but the lord would not
hearken to your voice nor give ear unto you
so ye abode in kadesh many days according unto the days that ye
abode there
then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the
way of the red sea as the lord spake unto me and we compassed mount
seir many days
and the lord spake unto me saying  ye have compassed this
mountain long enough turn you northward
and command thou the people saying ye are to pass through the
coast of your brethren the children of esau which dwell in seir and
they shall be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves
therefore  meddle not with them for i will not give you of their
land no not so much as a foot breadth because i have given mount
seir unto esau for a possession
ye shall buy meat of them for money that ye may eat and ye shall
also buy water of them for money that ye may drink
for the lord thy god hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
hand he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness these
forty years the lord thy god hath been with thee thou hast lacked
nothing
and when we passed by from our brethren the children of esau
which dwelt in seir through the way of the plain from elath and from
eziongaber we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of moab
and the lord said unto me distress not the moabites neither
contend with them in battle for i will not give thee of their land
for a possession because i have given ar unto the children of lot for
a possession
the emims dwelt therein in times past a people great and many
and tall as the anakims  which also were accounted giants as
the anakims but the moabites called them emims
the horims also dwelt in seir beforetime but the children of
esau succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before them
and dwelt in their stead as israel did unto the land of his
possession which the lord gave unto them
now rise up said i and get you over the brook zered and we
went over the brook zered
and the space in which we came from kadeshbarnea until we were
come over the brook zered was thirty and eight years until all the
generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host as
the lord sware unto them
for indeed the hand of the lord was against them to destroy them
from among the host until they were consumed
so it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed and
dead from among the people  that the lord spake unto me saying
thou art to pass over through ar the coast of moab this day
and when thou comest nigh over against the children of ammon
distress them not nor meddle with them for i will not give thee of
the land of the children of ammon any possession because i have given
it unto the children of lot for a possession
that also was accounted a land of giants giants dwelt therein
in old time and the ammonites call them zamzummims  a people
great and many and tall as the anakims but the lord destroyed them
before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead
as he did to the children of esau which dwelt in seir when he
destroyed the horims from before them and they succeeded them and
dwelt in their stead even unto this day  and the avims which
dwelt in hazerim even unto azzah the caphtorims which came forth
out of caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead   rise
ye up take your journey and pass over the river arnon behold i
have given into thine hand sihon the amorite king of heshbon and his
land begin to possess it and contend with him in battle
this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hear
report of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee
and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto
sihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying  let me pass
through thy land i will go along by the high way i will neither turn
unto the right hand nor to the left
thou shalt sell me meat for money that i may eat and give me
water for money that i may drink only i will pass through on my
feet  as the children of esau which dwell in seir and the
moabites which dwell in ar did unto me until i shall pass over
jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us
but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him for the
lord thy god hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that
he might deliver him into thy hand as appeareth this day
and the lord said unto me behold i have begun to give sihon and
his land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit his
land
then sihon came out against us he and all his people to fight
at jahaz
and the lord our god delivered him before us and we smote him
and his sons and all his people
and we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed
the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left
none to remain  only the cattle we took for a prey unto
ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we took
from aroer which is by the brink of the river of arnon and from
the city that is by the river even unto gilead there was not one
city too strong for us the lord our god delivered all unto us
only unto the land of the children of ammon thou camest not nor unto
any place of the river jabbok nor unto the cities in the mountains
nor unto whatsoever the lord our god forbad us
then we turned and went up the way to bashan and og the king of
bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at edrei
and the lord said unto me fear him not for i will deliver him
and all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt do
unto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at
heshbon
so the lord our god delivered into our hands og also the king of
bashan and all his people and we smote him until none was left to
him remaining
and we took all his cities at that time there was not a city
which we took not from them threescore cities all the region of
argob the kingdom of og in bashan
all these cities were fenced with high walls gates and bars
beside unwalled towns a great many
and we utterly destroyed them as we did unto sihon king of
heshbon utterly destroying the men women and children of every
city
but all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a
prey to ourselves
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the
amorites the land that was on this side jordan from the river of
arnon unto mount hermon  which hermon the sidonians call sirion
and the amorites call it shenir  all the cities of the plain
and all gilead and all bashan unto salchah and edrei cities of the
kingdom of og in bashan
for only og king of bashan remained of the remnant of giants
behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in rabbath of
the children of ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and four
cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a man
and this land which we possessed at that time from aroer which
is by the river arnon and half mount gilead and the cities thereof
gave i unto the reubenites and to the gadites
and the rest of gilead and all bashan being the kingdom of og
gave i unto the half tribe of manasseh all the region of argob with
all bashan which was called the land of giants
jair the son of manasseh took all the country of argob unto the
coasts of geshuri and maachathi and called them after his own name
bashanhavothjair unto this day
and i gave gilead unto machir
and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i gave from gilead
even unto the river arnon half the valley and the border even unto
the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon
the plain also and jordan and the coast thereof from chinnereth
even unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea under ashdothpisgah
eastward
and i commanded you at that time saying the lord your god hath
given you this land to possess it ye shall pass over armed before
your brethren the children of israel all that are meet for the war
but your wives and your little ones and your cattle for i
know that ye have much cattle shall abide in your cities which i
have given you  until the lord have given rest unto your
brethren as well as unto you and until they also possess the land
which the lord your god hath given them beyond jordan and then shall
ye return every man unto his possession which i have given you
and i commanded joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen
all that the lord your god hath done unto these two kings so shall
the lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest
ye shall not fear them for the lord your god he shall fight for
you
and i besought the lord at that time saying  o lord god
thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty
hand for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do
according to thy works and according to thy might   i pray thee
let me go over and see the good land that is beyond jordan that
goodly mountain and lebanon
but the lord was wroth with me for your sakes and would not hear
me and the lord said unto me let it suffice thee speak no more unto
me of this matter
get thee up into the top of pisgah and lift up thine eyes
westward and northward and southward and eastward and behold it
with thine eyes for thou shalt not go over this jordan
but charge joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he
shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inherit
the land which thou shalt see
so we abode in the valley over against bethpeor
now therefore hearken o israel unto the statutes and unto the
judgments which i teach you for to do them that ye may live and go
in and possess the land which the lord god of your fathers giveth you
ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall
ye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the commandments of the
lord your god which i command you
your eyes have seen what the lord did because of baalpeor for all
the men that followed baalpeor the lord thy god hath destroyed them
from among you
but ye that did cleave unto the lord your god are alive every one
of you this day
behold i have taught you statutes and judgments even as the lord
my god commanded me that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to
possess it
keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your
understanding in the sight of the nations which shall hear all these
statutes and say surely this great nation is a wise and
understanding people
for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them
as the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for
and what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so
righteous as all this law which i set before you this day   only
take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget
the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy
heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons
sons  specially the day that thou stoodest before the lord thy
god in horeb when the lord said unto me gather me the people
together and i will make them hear my words that they may learn to
fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth and that
they may teach their children
and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain
burned with fire unto the midst of heaven with darkness clouds and
thick darkness
and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire ye
heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude only ye heard a
voice
and he declared unto you his covenant which he commanded you to
perform even ten commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of
stone
and the lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
judgments that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to
possess it
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner
of similitude on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out of
the midst of the fire  lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a
graven image the similitude of any figure the likeness of male or
female  the likeness of any beast that is on the earth the
likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air  the likeness
of any thing that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fish
that is in the waters beneath the earth  and lest thou lift up
thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and
the stars even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship
them and serve them which the lord thy god hath divided unto all
nations under the whole heaven
but the lord hath taken you and brought you forth out of the
iron furnace even out of egypt to be unto him a people of
inheritance as ye are this day
furthermore the lord was angry with me for your sakes and sware
that i should not go over jordan and that i should not go in unto
that good land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
but i must die in this land i must not go over jordan but ye
shall go over and possess that good land
take heed unto yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of the
lord your god which he made with you and make you a graven image or
the likeness of any thing which the lord thy god hath forbidden thee
for the lord thy god is a consuming fire even a jealous god
when thou shalt beget children and childrens children and ye
shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves
and make a graven image or the likeness of any thing and shall do
evil in the sight of the lord thy god to provoke him to anger  i
call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that ye shall
soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan to
possess it ye shall not prolong your days upon it but shall utterly
be destroyed
and the lord shall scatter you among the nations and ye shall be
left few in number among the heathen whither the lord shall lead you
and there ye shall serve gods the work of mens hands wood and
stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell
but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god thou shalt
find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul
when thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon
thee even in the latter days if thou turn to the lord thy god and
shalt be obedient unto his voice  for the lord thy god is a
merciful god he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor
forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them
for ask now of the days that are past which were before thee
since the day that god created man upon the earth and ask from the
one side of heaven unto the other whether there hath been any such
thing as this great thing is or hath been heard like it   did
ever people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the
fire as thou hast heard and live   or hath god assayed to go
and take him a nation from the midst of another nation by
temptations by signs and by wonders and by war and by a mighty
hand and by a stretched out arm and by great terrors according to
all that the lord your god did for you in egypt before your eyes
unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord he
is god there is none else beside him
out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might
instruct thee and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire and thou
heardest his words out of the midst of the fire
and because he loved thy fathers therefore he chose their seed
after them and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power
out of egypt  to drive out nations from before thee greater and
mightier than thou art to bring thee in to give thee their land for
an inheritance as it is this day
know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that the
lord he is god in heaven above and upon the earth beneath there is
none else
thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments
which i command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with
thy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon
the earth which the lord thy god giveth thee for ever
then moses severed three cities on this side jordan toward the
sunrising  that the slayer might flee thither which should kill
his neighbour unawares and hated him not in times past and that
fleeing unto one of these cities he might live  namely bezer in
the wilderness in the plain country of the reubenites and ramoth in
gilead of the gadites and golan in bashan of the manassites
and this is the law which moses set before the children of
israel  these are the testimonies and the statutes and the
judgments which moses spake unto the children of israel after they
came forth out of egypt
on this side jordan in the valley over against bethpeor in the
land of sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon whom moses
and the children of israel smote after they were come forth out of
egypt  and they possessed his land and the land of og king of
bashan two kings of the amorites which were on this side jordan
toward the sunrising  from aroer which is by the bank of the
river arnon even unto mount sion which is hermon  and all the
plain on this side jordan eastward even unto the sea of the plain
under the springs of pisgah
and moses called all israel and said unto them hear o israel
the statutes and judgments which i speak in your ears this day that
ye may learn them and keep and do them
the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb
the lord made not this covenant with our fathers but with us
even us who are all of us here alive this day
the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the
midst of the fire  i stood between the lord and you at that time
to shew you the word of the lord for ye were afraid by reason of the
fire and went not up into the mount saying  i am the lord thy
god which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house of
bondage
thou shalt have none other gods before me
thou shalt not make thee any graven image or any likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or
that is in the waters beneath the earth  thou shalt not bow down
thyself unto them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous
god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the
third and fourth generation of them that hate me  and shewing
mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments
thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the
lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
keep the sabbath day to sanctify it as the lord thy god hath
commanded thee
six days thou shalt labour and do all thy work  but the
seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not
do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant
nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy
cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant
and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou
and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and
that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand
and by a stretched out arm therefore the lord thy god commanded thee
to keep the sabbath day
honour thy father and thy mother as the lord thy god hath
commanded thee that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go
well with thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
thou shalt not kill
neither shalt thou commit adultery
neither shalt thou steal
neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour
neither shalt thou desire thy neighbours wife neither shalt
thou covet thy neighbours house his field or his manservant or his
maidservant his ox or his ass or any thing that is thy neighbours
these words the lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount
out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness
with a great voice and he added no more and he wrote them in two
tables of stone and delivered them unto me
and it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of
the darkness for the mountain did burn with fire that ye came near
unto me even all the heads of your tribes and your elders  and
ye said behold the lord our god hath shewed us his glory and his
greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire
we have seen this day that god doth talk with man and he liveth
now therefore why should we die for this great fire will consume
us if we hear the voice of the lord our god any more then we shall
die
for who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the
living god speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have and
lived   go thou near and hear all that the lord our god shall
say and speak thou unto us all that the lord our god shall speak unto
thee and we will hear it and do it
and the lord heard the voice of your words when ye spake unto
me and the lord said unto me i have heard the voice of the words of
this people which they have spoken unto thee they have well said all
that they have spoken
o that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me
and keep all my commandments always that it might be well with them
and with their children for ever   go say to them get you into
your tents again
but as for thee stand thou here by me and i will speak unto
thee all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which
thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which i give
them to possess it
ye shall observe to do therefore as the lord your god hath
commanded you ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the
left
ye shall walk in all the ways which the lord your god hath
commanded you that ye may live and that it may be well with you and
that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess
now these are the commandments the statutes and the judgments
which the lord your god commanded to teach you that ye might do them
in the land whither ye go to possess it  that thou mightest fear
the lord thy god to keep all his statutes and his commandments which
i command thee thou and thy son and thy sons son all the days of
thy life and that thy days may be prolonged
hear therefore o israel and observe to do it that it may be
well with thee and that ye may increase mightily as the lord god of
thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and
honey
hear o israel the lord our god is one lord  and thou shalt
love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and
with all thy might
and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine
heart  and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and
shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou
walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up
and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they
shall be as frontlets between thine eyes
and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy
gates
and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee
into the land which he sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac
and to jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou
buildedst not  and houses full of all good things which thou
filledst not and wells digged which thou diggedst not vineyards and
olive trees which thou plantedst not when thou shalt have eaten and
be full  then beware lest thou forget the lord which brought
thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage
thou shalt fear the lord thy god and serve him and shalt swear
by his name
ye shall not go after other gods of the gods of the people which
are round about you  for the lord thy god is a jealous god among
you lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindled against thee and
destroy thee from off the face of the earth
ye shall not tempt the lord your god as ye tempted him in
massah
ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your god
and his testimonies and his statutes which he hath commanded thee
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of
the lord that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go in
and possess the good land which the lord sware unto thy fathers
to cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the lord hath
spoken
and when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what mean
the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the lord
our god hath commanded you   then thou shalt say unto thy son we
were pharaohs bondmen in egypt and the lord brought us out of egypt
with a mighty hand  and the lord shewed signs and wonders great
and sore upon egypt upon pharaoh and upon all his household before
our eyes  and he brought us out from thence that he might bring
us in to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers
and the lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the
lord our god for our good always that he might preserve us alive as
it is at this day
and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these
commandments before the lord our god as he hath commanded us
when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou
goest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before thee the
hittites and the girgashites and the amorites and the canaanites
and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites seven nations
greater and mightier than thou  and when the lord thy god shall
deliver them before thee thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy
them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor shew mercy unto them
neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter thou
shalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy
son
for they will turn away thy son from following me that they may
serve other gods so will the anger of the lord be kindled against
you and destroy thee suddenly
but thus shall ye deal with them ye shall destroy their altars
and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their
graven images with fire
for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy
god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all
people that are upon the face of the earth
the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because ye
were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all
people  but because the lord loved you and because he would keep
the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the lord brought
you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of
bondmen from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt
know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god
which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his
commandments to a thousand generations  and repayeth them that
hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slack to him
that hateth him he will repay him to his face
thou shalt therefore keep the commandments and the statutes and
the judgments which i command thee this day to do them
wherefore it shall come to pass if ye hearken to these
judgments and keep and do them that the lord thy god shall keep
unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers
and he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee he will
also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land thy corn
and thy wine and thine oil the increase of thy kine and the flocks
of thy sheep in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give
thee
thou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be male
or female barren among you or among your cattle
and the lord will take away from thee all sickness and will put
none of the evil diseases of egypt which thou knowest upon thee but
will lay them upon all them that hate thee
and thou shalt consume all the people which the lord thy god
shall deliver thee thine eye shall have no pity upon them neither
shalt thou serve their gods for that will be a snare unto thee
if thou shalt say in thine heart these nations are more than i
how can i dispossess them   thou shalt not be afraid of them but
shalt well remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto
all egypt  the great temptations which thine eyes saw and the
signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out
arm whereby the lord thy god brought thee out so shall the lord thy
god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid
moreover the lord thy god will send the hornet among them until
they that are left and hide themselves from thee be destroyed
thou shalt not be affrighted at them for the lord thy god is
among you a mighty god and terrible
and the lord thy god will put out those nations before thee by
little and little thou mayest not consume them at once lest the
beasts of the field increase upon thee
but the lord thy god shall deliver them unto thee and shall
destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand and thou shalt
destroy their name from under heaven there shall no man be able to
stand before thee until thou have destroyed them
the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire thou
shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto
thee lest thou be snared therin for it is an abomination to the lord
thy god
neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house lest
thou be a cursed thing like it but thou shalt utterly detest it and
thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is a cursed thing
all the commandments which i command thee this day shall ye
observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess
the land which the lord sware unto your fathers
and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led
thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove
thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his
commandments or no
and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee
with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that
he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live
thy raiment waxed not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell
these forty years
thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth
his son so the lord thy god chasteneth thee
therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god to
walk in his ways and to fear him
for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good land a land of
brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys
and hills  a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees
and pomegranates a land of oil olive and honey  a land wherein
thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack any thing
in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou
mayest dig brass
when thou hast eaten and art full then thou shalt bless the lord
thy god for the good land which he hath given thee
beware that thou forget not the lord thy god in not keeping his
commandments and his judgments and his statutes which i command
thee this day  lest when thou hast eaten and art full and hast
built goodly houses and dwelt therein  and when thy herds and
thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied and
all that thou hast is multiplied  then thine heart be lifted up
and thou forget the lord thy god which brought thee forth out of the
land of egypt from the house of bondage  who led thee through
that great and terrible wilderness wherein were fiery serpents and
scorpions and drought where there was no water who brought thee
forth water out of the rock of flint  who fed thee in the
wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not that he might
humble thee and that he might prove thee to do thee good at thy
latter end  and thou say in thine heart my power and the might
of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth
but thou shalt remember the lord thy god for it is he that
giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant
which he sware unto thy fathers as it is this day
and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord thy god and
walk after other gods and serve them and worship them i testify
against you this day that ye shall surely perish
as the nations which the lord destroyeth before your face so
shall ye perish because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of
the lord your god
hear o israel thou art to pass over jordan this day to go in to
possess nations greater and mightier than thyself cities great and
fenced up to heaven  a people great and tall the children of the
anakims whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say who can
stand before the children of anak   understand therefore this day
that the lord thy god is he which goeth over before thee as a
consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down
before thy face so shalt thou drive them out and destroy them
quickly as the lord hath said unto thee
speak not thou in thine heart after that the lord thy god hath
cast them out from before thee saying for my righteousness the lord
hath brought me in to possess this land but for the wickedness of
these nations the lord doth drive them out from before thee
not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart
dost thou go to possess their land but for the wickedness of these
nations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee and
that he may perform the word which the lord sware unto thy fathers
abraham isaac and jacob
understand therefore that the lord thy god giveth thee not this
good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art a
stiffnecked people
remember and forget not how thou provokedst the lord thy god to
wrath in the wilderness from the day that thou didst depart out of
the land of egypt until ye came unto this place ye have been
rebellious against the lord
also in horeb ye provoked the lord to wrath so that the lord was
angry with you to have destroyed you
when i was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone
even the tables of the covenant which the lord made with you then i
abode in the mount forty days and forty nights i neither did eat
bread nor drink water  and the lord delivered unto me two tables
of stone written with the finger of god and on them was written
according to all the words which the lord spake with you in the mount
out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly
and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights
that the lord gave me the two tables of stone even the tables of the
covenant
and the lord said unto me arise get thee down quickly from
hence for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of egypt have
corrupted themselves they are quickly turned aside out of the way
which i commanded them they have made them a molten image
furthermore the lord spake unto me saying i have seen this
people and behold it is a stiffnecked people  let me alone
that i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven
and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they
so i turned and came down from the mount and the mount burned
with fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands
and i looked and behold ye had sinned against the lord your
god and had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out
of the way which the lord had commanded you
and i took the two tables and cast them out of my two hands and
brake them before your eyes
and i fell down before the lord as at the first forty days and
forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all
your sins which ye sinned in doing wickedly in the sight of the lord
to provoke him to anger
for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith the
lord was wroth against you to destroy you but the lord hearkened unto
me at that time also
and the lord was very angry with aaron to have destroyed him and
i prayed for aaron also the same time
and i took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt it
with fire and stamped it and ground it very small even until it was
as small as dust and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that
descended out of the mount
and at taberah and at massah and at kibrothhattaavah ye
provoked the lord to wrath
likewise when the lord sent you from kadeshbarnea saying go up
and possess the land which i have given you then ye rebelled against
the commandment of the lord your god and ye believed him not nor
hearkened to his voice
ye have been rebellious against the lord from the day that i knew
you
thus i fell down before the lord forty days and forty nights as
i fell down at the first because the lord had said he would destroy
you
i prayed therefore unto the lord and said o lord god destroy
not thy people and thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed through
thy greatness which thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a
mighty hand
remember thy servants abraham isaac and jacob look not unto
the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their
sin  lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say because the
lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them
and because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them in
the wilderness
yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou
broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm
at that time the lord said unto me hew thee two tables of stone
like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee
an ark of wood
and i will write on the tables the words that were in the first
tables which thou brakest and thou shalt put them in the ark
and i made an ark of shittim wood and hewed two tables of stone
like unto the first and went up into the mount having the two tables
in mine hand
and he wrote on the tables according to the first writing the
ten commandments which the lord spake unto you in the mount out of
the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the lord gave
them unto me
and i turned myself and came down from the mount and put the
tables in the ark which i had made and there they be as the lord
commanded me
and the children of israel took their journey from beeroth of the
children of jaakan to mosera there aaron died and there he was
buried and eleazar his son ministered in the priests office in his
stead
from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah and from gudgodah to
jotbath a land of rivers of waters
at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi to bear the
ark of the covenant of the lord to stand before the lord to minister
unto him and to bless in his name unto this day
wherefore levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren
the lord is his inheritance according as the lord thy god promised
him
and i stayed in the mount according to the first time forty
days and forty nights and the lord hearkened unto me at that time
also and the lord would not destroy thee
and the lord said unto me arise take thy journey before the
people that they may go in and possess the land which i sware unto
their fathers to give unto them
and now israel what doth the lord thy god require of thee but
to fear the lord thy god to walk in all his ways and to love him
and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy
soul  to keep the commandments of the lord and his statutes
which i command thee this day for thy good   behold the heaven
and the heaven of heavens is the lords thy god the earth also with
all that therein is
only the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and he
chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this
day
circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more
stiffnecked
for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords a great
god a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh
reward  he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and
widow and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment
love ye therefore the stranger for ye were strangers in the
land of egypt
thou shalt fear the lord thy god him shalt thou serve and to
him shalt thou cleave and swear by his name
he is thy praise and he is thy god that hath done for thee
these great and terrible things which thine eyes have seen
thy fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten
persons and now the lord thy god hath made thee as the stars of
heaven for multitude
therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god and keep his charge
and his statutes and his judgments and his commandments alway
and know ye this day for i speak not with your children which
have not known and which have not seen the chastisement of the lord
your god his greatness his mighty hand and his stretched out arm
and his miracles and his acts which he did in the midst of
egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all his land  and
what he did unto the army of egypt unto their horses and to their
chariots how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as
they pursued after you and how the lord hath destroyed them unto this
day  and what he did unto you in the wilderness until ye came
into this place  and what he did unto dathan and abiram the sons
of eliab the son of reuben how the earth opened her mouth and
swallowed them up and their households and their tents and all the
substance that was in their possession in the midst of all israel
but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the lord which he
did
therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which i command you
this day that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land
whither ye go to possess it  and that ye may prolong your days in
the land which the lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and
to their seed a land that floweth with milk and honey
for the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the
land of egypt from whence ye came out where thou sowedst thy seed
and wateredst it with thy foot as a garden of herbs  but the
land whither ye go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and
drinketh water of the rain of heaven  a land which the lord thy
god careth for the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it from
the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year
and it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto
my commandments which i command you this day to love the lord your
god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul
that i will give you the rain of your land in his due season
the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy
corn and thy wine and thine oil
and i will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle that thou
mayest eat and be full
take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye
turn aside and serve other gods and worship them  and then the
lords wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that
there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit and lest ye
perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you
therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in
your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be
as frontlets between your eyes
and ye shall teach them your children speaking of them when
thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way when
thou liest down and when thou risest up
and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house
and upon thy gates  that your days may be multiplied and the
days of your children in the land which the lord sware unto your
fathers to give them as the days of heaven upon the earth
for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which i
command you to do them to love the lord your god to walk in all his
ways and to cleave unto him  then will the lord drive out all
these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater nations
and mightier than yourselves
every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be
yours from the wilderness and lebanon from the river the river
euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be
there shall no man be able to stand before you for the lord
your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the
land that ye shall tread upon as he hath said unto you
behold i set before you this day a blessing and a curse
a blessing if ye obey the commandments of the lord your god which i
command you this day  and a curse if ye will not obey the
commandments of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which
i command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not
known
and it shall come to pass when the lord thy god hath brought
thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it that thou
shalt put the blessing upon mount gerizim and the curse upon mount
ebal
are they not on the other side jordan by the way where the sun
goeth down in the land of the canaanites which dwell in the
champaign over against gilgal beside the plains of moreh   for
ye shall pass over jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord
your god giveth you and ye shall possess it and dwell therein
and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which
i set before you this day
these are the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to
do in the land which the lord god of thy fathers giveth thee to
possess it all the days that ye live upon the earth
ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations
which ye shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and
upon the hills and under every green tree  and ye shall
overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves
with fire and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and
destroy the names of them out of that place
ye shall not do so unto the lord your god
but unto the place which the lord your god shall choose out of
all your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation shall
ye seek and thither thou shalt come  and thither ye shall bring
your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and heave
offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings
and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks  and there ye
shall eat before the lord your god and ye shall rejoice in all that
ye put your hand unto ye and your households wherein the lord thy
god hath blessed thee
ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day
every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes
for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance
which the lord your god giveth you
but when ye go over jordan and dwell in the land which the lord
your god giveth you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from all
your enemies round about so that ye dwell in safety  then there
shall be a place which the lord your god shall choose to cause his
name to dwell there thither shall ye bring all that i command you
your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the heave
offering of your hand and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the
lord  and ye shall rejoice before the lord your god ye and
your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your
maidservants and the levite that is within your gates forasmuch as
he hath no part nor inheritance with you
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in
every place that thou seest  but in the place which the lord
shall choose in one of thy tribes there thou shalt offer thy burnt
offerings and there thou shalt do all that i command thee
notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after according to the blessing of the
lord thy god which he hath given thee the unclean and the clean may
eat thereof as of the roebuck and as of the hart
only ye shall not eat the blood ye shall pour it upon the earth
as water
thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or
of thy wine or of thy oil or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy
flock nor any of thy vows which thou vowest nor thy freewill
offerings or heave offering of thine hand  but thou must eat
them before the lord thy god in the place which the lord thy god shall
choose thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and
thy maidservant and the levite that is within thy gates and thou
shalt rejoice before the lord thy god in all that thou puttest thine
hands unto
take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as
thou livest upon the earth
when the lord thy god shall enlarge thy border as he hath
promised thee and thou shalt say i will eat flesh because thy soul
longeth to eat flesh thou mayest eat flesh whatsoever thy soul
lusteth after
if the place which the lord thy god hath chosen to put his name
there be too far from thee then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of
thy flock which the lord hath given thee as i have commanded thee
and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after
even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten so thou shalt eat
them the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike
only be sure that thou eat not the blood for the blood is the
life and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh
thou shalt not eat it thou shalt pour it upon the earth as
water
thou shalt not eat it that it may go well with thee and with
thy children after thee when thou shalt do that which is right in the
sight of the lord
only thy holy things which thou hast and thy vows thou shalt
take and go unto the place which the lord shall choose  and
thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings the flesh and the blood upon
the altar of the lord thy god and the blood of thy sacrifices shall
be poured out upon the altar of the lord thy god and thou shalt eat
the flesh
observe and hear all these words which i command thee that it
may go well with thee and with thy children after thee for ever when
thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the lord thy
god
when the lord thy god shall cut off the nations from before
thee whither thou goest to possess them and thou succeedest them
and dwellest in their land  take heed to thyself that thou be
not snared by following them after that they be destroyed from before
thee and that thou enquire not after their gods saying how did
these nations serve their gods even so will i do likewise
thou shalt not do so unto the lord thy god for every
abomination to the lord which he hateth have they done unto their
gods for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the
fire to their gods
what thing soever i command you observe to do it thou shalt
not add thereto nor diminish from it
if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and
giveth thee a sign or a wonder  and the sign or the wonder come
to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other
gods which thou hast not known and let us serve them  thou
shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of
dreams for the lord your god proveth you to know whether ye love the
lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul
ye shall walk after the lord your god and fear him and keep his
commandments and obey his voice and ye shall serve him and cleave
unto him
and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to
death because he hath spoken to turn you away from the lord your god
which brought you out of the land of egypt and redeemed you out of
the house of bondage to thrust thee out of the way which the lord thy
god commanded thee to walk in so shalt thou put the evil away from
the midst of thee
if thy brother the son of thy mother or thy son or thy
daughter or the wife of thy bosom or thy friend which is as thine
own soul entice thee secretly saying let us go and serve other
gods which thou hast not known thou nor thy fathers  namely
of the gods of the people which are round about you nigh unto thee
or far off from thee from the one end of the earth even unto the
other end of the earth  thou shalt not consent unto him nor
hearken unto him neither shall thine eye pity him neither shalt thou
spare neither shalt thou conceal him  but thou shalt surely kill
him thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death and
afterwards the hand of all the people
and thou shalt stone him with stones that he die because he
hath sought to thrust thee away from the lord thy god which brought
thee out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage
and all israel shall hear and fear and shall do no more any
such wickedness as this is among you
if thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities which the lord thy
god hath given thee to dwell there saying  certain men the
children of belial are gone out from among you and have withdrawn
the inhabitants of their city saying let us go and serve other gods
which ye have not known  then shalt thou enquire and make
search and ask diligently and behold if it be truth and the thing
certain that such abomination is wrought among you  thou shalt
surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword
destroying it utterly and all that is therein and the cattle
thereof with the edge of the sword
and thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the
street thereof and shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil
thereof every whit for the lord thy god and it shall be an heap for
ever it shall not be built again
and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand
that the lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger and shew thee
mercy and have compassion upon thee and multiply thee as he hath
sworn unto thy fathers  when thou shalt hearken to the voice of
the lord thy god to keep all his commandments which i command thee
this day to do that which is right in the eyes of the lord thy god
ye are the children of the lord your god ye shall not cut
yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead
for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord
hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the
nations that are upon the earth
thou shalt not eat any abominable thing
these are the beasts which ye shall eat the ox the sheep and
the goat  the hart and the roebuck and the fallow deer and the
wild goat and the pygarg and the wild ox and the chamois
and every beast that parteth the hoof and cleaveth the cleft
into two claws and cheweth the cud among the beasts that ye shall
eat
nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud or
of them that divide the cloven hoof as the camel and the hare and
the coney for they chew the cud but divide not the hoof therefore
they are unclean unto you
and the swine because it divideth the hoof yet cheweth not the
cud it is unclean unto you ye shall not eat of their flesh nor
touch their dead carcase
these ye shall eat of all that are in the waters all that have
fins and scales shall ye eat  and whatsoever hath not fins and
scales ye may not eat it is unclean unto you

but these are they of which ye shall not eat the eagle and the
ossifrage and the ospray  and the glede and the kite and the
vulture after his kind  and every raven after his kind
and the owl and the night hawk and the cuckow and the hawk after
his kind  the little owl and the great owl and the swan
and the pelican and the gier eagle and the cormorant  and the
stork and the heron after her kind and the lapwing and the bat
and every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you they
shall not be eaten
but of all clean fowls ye may eat

give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates that he may eat it or
thou mayest sell it unto an alien for thou art an holy people unto
the lord thy god

field bringeth forth year by year
and thou shalt eat before the lord thy god in the place which
he shall choose to place his name there the tithe of thy corn of thy
wine and of thine oil and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy
flocks that thou mayest learn to fear the lord thy god always
and if the way be too long for thee so that thou art not able
to carry it or if the place be too far from thee which the lord thy
god shall choose to set his name there when the lord thy god hath
blessed thee  then shalt thou turn it into money and bind up
the money in thine hand and shalt go unto the place which the lord
thy god shall choose  and thou shalt bestow that money for
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after for oxen or for sheep or for
wine or for strong drink or for whatsoever thy soul desireth and
thou shalt eat there before the lord thy god and thou shalt rejoice
thou and thine household  and the levite that is within thy
gates thou shalt not forsake him for he hath no part nor inheritance
with thee
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe
of thine increase the same year and shalt lay it up within thy gates

thee and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow which are
within thy gates shall come and shall eat and be satisfied that the
lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou
doest
at the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release
and this is the manner of the release every creditor that
lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it he shall not exact
it of his neighbour or of his brother because it is called the
lords release
of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again but that which is
thine with thy brother thine hand shall release  save when there
shall be no poor among you for the lord shall greatly bless thee in
the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to
possess it  only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the
lord thy god to observe to do all these commandments which i command
thee this day
for the lord thy god blesseth thee as he promised thee and thou
shalt lend unto many nations but thou shalt not borrow and thou
shalt reign over many nations but they shall not reign over thee
if there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within
any of thy gates in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou
shalt not harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor
brother  but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him and shalt
surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth
beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart saying
the seventh year the year of release is at hand and thine eye be
evil against thy poor brother and thou givest him nought and he cry
unto the lord against thee and it be sin unto thee

when thou givest unto him because that for this thing the lord thy
god shall bless thee in all thy works and in all that thou puttest
thine hand unto

command thee saying thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy
brother to thy poor and to thy needy in thy land

unto thee and serve thee six years then in the seventh year thou
shalt let him go free from thee

flock and out of thy floor and out of thy winepress of that
wherewith the lord thy god hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him
and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of
egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee therefore i command thee
this thing to day
and it shall be if he say unto thee i will not go away from
thee because he loveth thee and thine house because he is well with
thee  then thou shalt take an aul and thrust it through his ear
unto the door and he shall be thy servant for ever and also unto thy
maidservant thou shalt do likewise
it shall not seem hard unto thee when thou sendest him away
free from thee for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee
in serving thee six years and the lord thy god shall bless thee in
all that thou doest

choose to place his name there

in the sight of the lord thy god in transgressing his covenant
and hath gone and served other gods and worshipped them either the
sun or moon or any of the host of heaven which i have not
commanded  and it be told thee and thou hast heard of it and

unto thy gates even that man or that woman and shalt stone them with
stones till they die

death and afterward the hands of all the people so thou shalt put
the evil away from among you
if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment between
blood and blood between plea and plea and between stroke and stroke
being matters of controversy within thy gates then shalt thou arise
and get thee up into the place which the lord thy god shall choose
and thou shalt come unto the priests the levites and unto the
judge that shall be in those days and enquire and they shall shew
thee the sentence of judgment  and thou shalt do according to
the sentence which they of that place which the lord shall choose
shall shew thee and thou shalt observe to do according to all that
they inform thee  according to the sentence of the law which
they shall teach thee and according to the judgment which they shall
tell thee thou shalt do thou shalt not decline from the sentence
which they shall shew thee to the right hand nor to the left
and the man that will do presumptuously and will not hearken
unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the lord thy
god or unto the judge even that man shall die and thou shalt put
away the evil from israel
and all the people shall hear and fear and do no more
presumptuously
when thou art come unto the land which the lord thy god giveth
thee and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein and shalt say i
will set a king over me like as all the nations that are about me
thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the lord thy
god shall choose one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over
thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy
brother
but he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the
people to return to egypt to the end that he should multiply horses
forasmuch as the lord hath said unto you ye shall henceforth return
no more that way
neither shall he multiply wives to himself that his heart turn
not away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and
gold
and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom
that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which
is before the priests the levites  and it shall be with him and
he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to
fear the lord his god to keep all the words of this law and these
statutes to do them  that his heart be not lifted up above his
brethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the
right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in
his kingdom he and his children in the midst of israel
the priests the levites and all the tribe of levi shall have no
part nor inheritance with israel they shall eat the offerings of the
lord made by fire and his inheritance
therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren
the lord is their inheritance as he hath said unto them
and this shall be the priests due from the people from them
that offer a sacrifice whether it be ox or sheep and they shall give
unto the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the maw
the firstfruit also of thy corn of thy wine and of thine oil
and the first of the fleece of thy sheep shalt thou give him
for the lord thy god hath chosen him out of all thy tribes to
stand to minister in the name of the lord him and his sons for ever
and if a levite come from any of thy gates out of all israel
where he sojourned and come with all the desire of his mind unto the
place which the lord shall choose  then he shall minister in the
name of the lord his god as all his brethren the levites do which
stand there before the lord
they shall have like portions to eat beside that which cometh of
the sale of his patrimony
when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god giveth
thee thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those
nations
there shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son
or his daughter to pass through the fire or that useth divination or
an observer of times or an enchanter or a witch
or a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard
or a necromancer
for all that do these things are an abomination unto the lord
and because of these abominations the lord thy god doth drive them out
from before thee
thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy god
for these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto
observers of times and unto diviners but as for thee the lord thy
god hath not suffered thee so to do
the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the
midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shall
hearken  according to all that thou desiredst of the lord thy
god in horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again
the voice of the lord my god neither let me see this great fire any
more that i die not
and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they
have spoken
i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like
unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto
them all that i shall command him
and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto
my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him
but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name
which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the
name of other gods even that prophet shall die
and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which
the lord hath not spoken   when a prophet speaketh in the name
of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the
thing which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it
presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him
when the lord thy god hath cut off the nations whose land the
lord thy god giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwellest in
their cities and in their houses  thou shalt separate three
cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the lord thy god
giveth thee to possess it
thou shalt prepare thee a way and divide the coasts of thy land
which the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit into three parts that
every slayer may flee thither
and this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither
that he may live whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly whom he
hated not in time past  as when a man goeth into the wood with
his neighbour to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe
to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and
lighteth upon his neighbour that he die he shall flee unto one of
those cities and live  lest the avenger of the blood pursue the
slayer while his heart is hot and overtake him because the way is
long and slay him whereas he was not worthy of death inasmuch as he
hated him not in time past
wherefore i command thee saying thou shalt separate three
cities for thee
and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast as he hath sworn unto
thy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto
thy fathers  if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do
them which i command thee this day to love the lord thy god and to
walk ever in his ways then shalt thou add three cities more for thee
beside these three  that innocent blood be not shed in thy land
which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and so blood be
upon thee
but if any man hate his neighbour and lie in wait for him and
rise up against him and smite him mortally that he die and fleeth
into one of these cities  then the elders of his city shall send
and fetch him thence and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of
blood that he may die
thine eye shall not pity him but thou shalt put away the guilt
of innocent blood from israel that it may go well with thee
thou shalt not remove thy neighbours landmark which they of
old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in
the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it
one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or
for any sin in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of two
witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be
established
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against
him that which is wrong  then both the men between whom the
controversy is shall stand before the lord before the priests and
the judges which shall be in those days  and the judges shall
make diligent inquisition and behold if the witness be a false
witness and hath testified falsely against his brother  then
shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother
so shalt thou put the evil away from among you
and those which remain shall hear and fear and shall
henceforth commit no more any such evil among you
and thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eye
for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and seest
horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of
them for the lord thy god is with thee which brought thee up out of
the land of egypt
and it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battle that the
priest shall approach and speak unto the people  and shall say
unto them hear o israel ye approach this day unto battle against
your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble
neither be ye terrified because of them  for the lord your god is
he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save
you
and the officers shall speak unto the people saying what man is
there that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it let him
go and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man
dedicate it
and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not yet
eaten of it let him also go and return unto his house lest he die in
the battle and another man eat of it
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not
taken her let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the
battle and another man take her
and the officers shall speak further unto the people and they
shall say what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted let him
go and return unto his house lest his brethrens heart faint as well
as his heart
and it shall be when the officers have made an end of speaking
unto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead
the people
when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it then
proclaim peace unto it
and it shall be if it make thee answer of peace and open unto
thee then it shall be that all the people that is found therein
shall be tributaries unto thee and they shall serve thee
and if it will make no peace with thee but will make war
against thee then thou shalt besiege it  and when the lord thy
god hath delivered it into thine hands thou shalt smite every male
thereof with the edge of the sword  but the women and the
little ones and the cattle and all that is in the city even all the
spoil thereof shalt thou take unto thyself and thou shalt eat the
spoil of thine enemies which the lord thy god hath given thee
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off
from thee which are not of the cities of these nations
but of the cities of these people which the lord thy god doth
give thee for an inheritance thou shalt save alive nothing that
breatheth  but thou shalt utterly destroy them namely the
hittites and the amorites the canaanites and the perizzites the
hivites and the jebusites as the lord thy god hath commanded thee
that they teach you not to do after all their abominations
which they have done unto their gods so should ye sin against the
lord your god
when thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war
against it to take it thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by
forcing an axe against them for thou mayest eat of them and thou
shalt not cut them down for the tree of the field is mans life to
employ them in the siege  only the trees which thou knowest that
they be not trees for meat thou shalt destroy and cut them down and
thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee
until it be subdued
if one be found slain in the land which the lord thy god giveth
thee to possess it lying in the field and it be not known who hath
slain him  then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth and
they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is
slain  and it shall be that the city which is next unto the
slain man even the elders of that city shall take an heifer which
hath not been wrought with and which hath not drawn in the yoke
and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough
valley which is neither eared nor sown and shall strike off the
heifers neck there in the valley  and the priests the sons of
levi shall come near for them the lord thy god hath chosen to
minister unto him and to bless in the name of the lord and by their
word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried  and all
the elders of that city that are next unto the slain man shall wash
their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley  and
they shall answer and say our hands have not shed this blood neither
have our eyes seen it
be merciful o lord unto thy people israel whom thou hast
redeemed and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of israels
charge and the blood shall be forgiven them
so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among
you when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord
when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies and the lord
thy god hath delivered them into thine hands and thou hast taken them
captive  and seest among the captives a beautiful woman and
hast a desire unto her that thou wouldest have her to thy wife
then thou shalt bring her home to thine house and she shall shave her
head and pare her nails  and she shall put the raiment of her
captivity from off her and shall remain in thine house and bewail
her father and her mother a full month and after that thou shalt go
in unto her and be her husband and she shall be thy wife
and it shall be if thou have no delight in her then thou shalt
let her go whither she will but thou shalt not sell her at all for
money thou shalt not make merchandise of her because thou hast
humbled her
if a man have two wives one beloved and another hated and
they have born him children both the beloved and the hated and if
the firstborn son be hers that was hated  then it shall be when
he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath that he may not make
the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is
indeed the firstborn  but he shall acknowledge the son of the
hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he
hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the
firstborn is his
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey
the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when
they have chastened him will not hearken unto them  then shall
his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the
elders of his city and unto the gate of his place  and they
shall say unto the elders of his city this our son is stubborn and
rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a
drunkard
and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he
die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all israel shall
hear and fear
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be to
be put to death and thou hang him on a tree  his body shall not
remain all night upon the tree but thou shalt in any wise bury him
that day for he that is hanged is accursed of god that thy land be
not defiled which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
thou shalt not see thy brothers ox or his sheep go astray and
hide thyself from them thou shalt in any case bring them again unto
thy brother
and if thy brother be not nigh unto thee or if thou know him
not then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house and it shall be
with thee until thy brother seek after it and thou shalt restore it
to him again
in like manner shalt thou do with his ass and so shalt thou do
with his raiment and with all lost thing of thy brothers which he
hath lost and thou hast found shalt thou do likewise thou mayest
not hide thyself

way and hide thyself from them thou shalt surely help him to lift

mother take and bring forth the tokens of the damsels virginity unto
the elders of the city in the gate  and the damsels father
shall say unto the elders i gave my daughter unto this man to wife
and he hateth her  and lo he hath given occasions of speech
against her saying i found not thy daughter a maid and yet these
are the tokens of my daughters virginity and they shall spread the
cloth before the elders of the city
and the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise
him  and they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver
and give them unto the father of the damsel because he hath brought
up an evil name upon a virgin of israel and she shall be his wife he
may not put her away all his days
but if this thing be true and the tokens of virginity be not
found for the damsel  then they shall bring out the damsel to
the door of her fathers house and the men of her city shall stone
her with stones that she die because she hath wrought folly in
israel to play the whore in her fathers house so shalt thou put
evil away from among you

city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbours wife so

force her and lie with her then the man only that lay with her shall
die

her in the field and the betrothed damsel cried and there was none
to save her

hindmost of thee even all that were feeble behind thee when thou
wast faint and weary and he feared not god

blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven thou shalt not
forget it
and it shall be when thou art come in unto the land which the

dwellest therein  that thou shalt take of the first of all the
fruit of the earth which thou shalt bring of thy land that the lord
thy god giveth thee and shalt put it in a basket and shalt go unto

lord god of our fathers the lord heard our voice and looked on our
affliction and our labour and our oppression  and the lord
brought us forth out of egypt with a mighty hand and with an
outstretched arm and with great terribleness and with signs and
with wonders  and he hath brought us into this place and hath

which thou o lord hast given me and thou shalt set it before the
lord thy god and worship before the lord thy god  and thou

it unto the levite the stranger the fatherless and the widow that
they may eat within thy gates and be filled  then thou shalt
say before the lord thy god i have brought away the hallowed things
out of mine house and also have given them unto the levite and unto
the stranger to the fatherless and to the widow according to all
thy commandments which thou hast commanded me i have not transgressed
thy commandments neither have i forgotten them

judgments and to hearken unto his voice  and the lord hath

name and in honour and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the
lord thy god as he hath spoken
and moses with the elders of israel commanded the people saying
keep all the commandments which i command you this day
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over jordan unto
the land which the lord thy god giveth thee that thou shalt set thee
up great stones and plaister them with plaister  and thou shalt
write upon them all the words of this law when thou art passed over
that thou mayest go in unto the land which the lord thy god giveth
thee a land that floweth with milk and honey as the lord god of thy
fathers hath promised thee
therefore it shall be when ye be gone over jordan that ye shall
set up these stones which i command you this day in mount ebal and
thou shalt plaister them with plaister
and there shalt thou build an altar unto the lord thy god an
altar of stones thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them
thou shalt build the altar of the lord thy god of whole stones
and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the lord thy god
and thou shalt offer peace offerings and shalt eat there and
rejoice before the lord thy god
and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law
very plainly
and moses and the priests the levites spake unto all israel
saying take heed and hearken o israel this day thou art become the
people of the lord thy god
thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the lord thy god and do
his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day
and moses charged the people the same day saying  these
shall stand upon mount gerizim to bless the people when ye are come
over jordan simeon and levi and judah and issachar and joseph
and benjamin  and these shall stand upon mount ebal to curse
reuben gad and asher and zebulun dan and naphtali
and the levites shall speak and say unto all the men of israel
with a loud voice  cursed be the man that maketh any graven or

the craftsman and putteth it in a secret place and all the people
shall answer and say amen

people shall say amen
cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person and
all the people shall say amen
cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do
them and all the people shall say amen
and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto
the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his
commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will
set thee on high above all nations of the earth  and all these
blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken
unto the voice of the lord thy god

thy god and walk in his ways

and the lord shall make thee plenteous in goods in the fruit of
thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy
ground in the land which the lord sware unto thy fathers to give
thee
the lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to
give the rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work

hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god which i command
thee this day to observe and to do them  and thou shalt not go
aside from any of the words which i command thee this day to the
right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them
but it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the

his statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses
shall come upon thee and overtake thee  cursed shalt thou be in
the city and cursed shalt thou be in the field

have consumed thee from off the land whither thou goest to possess
it

emerods and with the scab and with the itch whereof thou canst not
be healed

the lord shall smite thee in the knees and in the legs with a
sore botch that cannot be healed from the sole of thy foot unto the
top of thy head
the lord shall bring thee and thy king which thou shalt set

moreover all these curses shall come upon thee and shall pursue
thee and overtake thee till thou be destroyed because thou
hearkenedst not unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his
commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee  and they
shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder and upon thy seed for
ever
because thou servedst not the lord thy god with joyfulness and

against thee in hunger and in thirst and in nakedness and in want
of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck until he
have destroyed thee
the lord shall bring a nation against thee from far from the

land which the lord thy god hath given thee
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body the flesh of thy
sons and of thy daughters which the lord thy god hath given thee in
the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall
distress thee  so that the man that is tender among you and
very delicate his eye shall be evil toward his brother and toward
the wife of his bosom and toward the remnant of his children which he
shall leave  so that he will not give to any of them of the
flesh of his children whom he shall eat because he hath nothing left
him in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall
distress thee in all thy gates
the tender and delicate woman among you which would not
adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness
and tenderness her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom
and toward her son and toward her daughter  and toward her
young one that cometh out from between her feet and toward her
children which she shall bear for she shall eat them for want of all
things secretly in the siege and straitness wherewith thine enemy
shall distress thee in thy gates
if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that
are written in this book that thou mayest fear this glorious and
fearful name the lord thy god  then the lord will make thy
plagues wonderful and the plagues of thy seed even great plagues
and of long continuance and sore sicknesses and of long continuance
moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of egypt
which thou wast afraid of and they shall cleave unto thee
also every sickness and every plague which is not written in
the book of this law them will the lord bring upon thee until thou
be destroyed
and ye shall be left few in number whereas ye were as the stars
of heaven for multitude because thou wouldest not obey the voice of
the lord thy god
and it shall come to pass that as the lord rejoiced over you to
do you good and to multiply you so the lord will rejoice over you to
destroy you and to bring you to nought and ye shall be plucked from
off the land whither thou goest to possess it
and the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one
end of the earth even unto the other and there thou shalt serve other
gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even wood and
stone
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease neither shall
the sole of thy foot have rest but the lord shall give thee there a
trembling heart and failing of eyes and sorrow of mind  and
thy life shall hang in doubt before thee and thou shalt fear day and
night and shalt have none assurance of thy life  in the morning
thou shalt say would god it were even and at even thou shalt say
would god it were morning for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou
shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see
and the lord shall bring thee into egypt again with ships by
the way whereof i spake unto thee thou shalt see it no more again
and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and
bondwomen and no man shall buy you
these are the words of the covenant which the lord commanded
moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab beside
the covenant which he made with them in horeb
and moses called unto all israel and said unto them ye have
seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto
pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land  the
great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those
great miracles  yet the lord hath not given you an heart to
perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day
and i have led you forty years in the wilderness your clothes
are not waxen old upon you and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy
foot
ye have not eaten bread neither have ye drunk wine or strong
drink that ye might know that i am the lord your god
and when ye came unto this place sihon the king of heshbon and
og the king of bashan came out against us unto battle and we smote
them  and we took their land and gave it for an inheritance unto
the reubenites and to the gadites and to the half tribe of manasseh
keep therefore the words of this covenant and do them that ye
may prosper in all that ye do
ye stand this day all of you before the lord your god your
captains of your tribes your elders and your officers with all the
men of israel  your little ones your wives and thy stranger
that is in thy camp from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy
water  that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the lord thy
god and into his oath which the lord thy god maketh with thee this
day  that he may establish thee to day for a people unto
himself and that he may be unto thee a god as he hath said unto
thee and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and
to jacob
neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath
but with him that standeth here with us this day before the lord
our god and also with him that is not here with us this day
for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of egypt and how we came
through the nations which ye passed by  and ye have seen their
abominations and their idols wood and stone silver and gold which
were among them  lest there should be among you man or woman
or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the lord
our god to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should
be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood  and it come
to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he bless
himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the
imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst  the
lord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and his
jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are
written in this book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot out
his name from under heaven
and the lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes
of israel according to all the curses of the covenant that are
written in this book of the law  so that the generation to come
of your children that shall rise up after you and the stranger that
shall come from a far land shall say when they see the plagues of
that land and the sicknesses which the lord hath laid upon it
and that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burning
that it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth therein like
the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboim which the
lord overthrew in his anger and in his wrath  even all nations
shall say wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this land what
meaneth the heat of this great anger   then men shall say
because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord god of their
fathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the
land of egypt  for they went and served other gods and
worshipped them gods whom they knew not and whom he had not given
unto them  and the anger of the lord was kindled against this
land to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book
and the lord rooted them out of their land in anger and in
wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land as
it is this day
the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things
which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that
we may do all the words of this law
and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon
thee the blessing and the curse which i have set before thee and
thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the lord
thy god hath driven thee  and shalt return unto the lord thy god
and shalt obey his voice according to all that i command thee this
day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy
soul  that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity and
have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all
the nations whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee
if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven
from thence will the lord thy god gather thee and from thence will he
fetch thee  and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land
which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do
thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers
and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart and the heart
of thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with
all thy soul that thou mayest live
and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thine
enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee
and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord and do all
his commandments which i command thee this day
and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of
thine hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle
and in the fruit of thy land for good for the lord will again
rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers  if
thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his
commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the
law and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart and
with all thy soul
for this commandment which i command thee this day it is not
hidden from thee neither is it far off
it is not in heaven that thou shouldest say who shall go up
for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do
it   neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say who
shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear
it and do it   but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy
mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it
see i have set before thee this day life and good and death
and evil  in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy
god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his
statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and
the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to
possess it
but if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear but
shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them  i
denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye
shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over
jordan to go to possess it
i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i
have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore
choose life that both thou and thy seed may live  that thou
mayest love the lord thy god and that thou mayest obey his voice and
that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length
of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord sware
unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give them
and moses went and spake these words unto all israel
and he said unto them i am an hundred and twenty years old this
day i can no more go out and come in also the lord hath said unto
me thou shalt not go over this jordan
the lord thy god he will go over before thee and he will
destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them
and joshua he shall go over before thee as the lord hath said
and the lord shall do unto them as he did to sihon and to og
kings of the amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyed
and the lord shall give them up before your face that ye may do
unto them according unto all the commandments which i have commanded
you
be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them
for the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee he will not
fail thee nor forsake thee
and moses called unto joshua and said unto him in the sight of
all israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with
this people unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathers
to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it
and the lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be with
thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither
be dismayed
and moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the
sons of levi which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord and unto
all the elders of israel
and moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven
years in the solemnity of the year of release in the feast of
tabernacles  when all israel is come to appear before the lord
thy god in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this law
before all israel in their hearing
gather the people together men and women and children and thy
stranger that is within thy gates that they may hear and that they
may learn and fear the lord your god and observe to do all the words
of this law  and that their children which have not known any
thing may hear and learn to fear the lord your god as long as ye
live in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it
and the lord said unto moses behold thy days approach that
thou must die call joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacle
of the congregation that i may give him a charge and moses and
joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the
congregation
and the lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud
and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle
and the lord said unto moses behold thou shalt sleep with thy
fathers and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods
of the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them and
will forsake me and break my covenant which i have made with them
then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and i
will forsake them and i will hide my face from them and they shall
be devoured and many evils and troubles shall befall them so that
they will say in that day are not these evils come upon us because
our god is not among us   and i will surely hide my face in that
day for all the evils which they shall have wrought in that they are
turned unto other gods
now therefore write ye this song for you and teach it the
children of israel put it in their mouths that this song may be a
witness for me against the children of israel
for when i shall have brought them into the land which i sware
unto their fathers that floweth with milk and honey and they shall
have eaten and filled themselves and waxen fat then will they turn
unto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my
covenant
and it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are
befallen them that this song shall testify against them as a witness
for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for i
know their imagination which they go about even now before i have
brought them into the land which i sware
moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it the
children of israel
and he gave joshua the son of nun a charge and said be strong
and of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of israel
into the land which i sware unto them and i will be with thee
and it came to pass when moses had made an end of writing the
words of this law in a book until they were finished  that
moses commanded the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the
lord saying  take this book of the law and put it in the side
of the ark of the covenant of the lord your god that it may be there
for a witness against thee
for i know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while i am
yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the lord
and how much more after my death   gather unto me all the elders
of your tribes and your officers that i may speak these words in
their ears and call heaven and earth to record against them
for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
yourselves and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you
and evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will do evil
in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger through the work of
your hands
and moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of israel
the words of this song until they were ended
give ear o ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth the
words of my mouth
my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the
dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon
the grass  because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe
ye greatness unto our god
he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are
judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he
they have corrupted themselves their spot is not the spot of his
children they are a perverse and crooked generation
do ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and unwise is not
he thy father that hath bought thee hath he not made thee and
established thee   remember the days of old consider the years
of many generations ask thy father and he will shew thee thy
elders and they will tell thee
when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance when
he separated the sons of adam he set the bounds of the people
according to the number of the children of israel
for the lords portion is his people jacob is the lot of his
inheritance
he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling
wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the
apple of his eye
as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young
spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings
so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god
with him
he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might
eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of
the rock and oil out of the flinty rock  butter of kine and
milk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of bashan and
goats with the fat of kidneys of wheat and thou didst drink the pure
blood of the grape
but jeshurun waxed fat and kicked thou art waxen fat thou art
grown thick thou art covered with fatness then he forsook god which
made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation
they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods with
abominations provoked they him to anger
they sacrificed unto devils not to god to gods whom they knew
not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not
of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful and hast
forgotten god that formed thee
and when the lord saw it he abhorred them because of the
provoking of his sons and of his daughters
and he said i will hide my face from them i will see what
their end shall be for they are a very froward generation children
in whom is no faith
they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not god they
have provoked me to anger with their vanities and i will move them to
jealousy with those which are not a people i will provoke them to
anger with a foolish nation
for a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the
lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on
fire the foundations of the mountains
i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon
them
they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat
and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts upon
them with the poison of serpents of the dust
the sword without and terror within shall destroy both the
young man and the virgin the suckling also with the man of gray
hairs
i said i would scatter them into corners i would make the
remembrance of them to cease from among men  were it not that i
feared the wrath of the enemy lest their adversaries should behave
themselves strangely and lest they should say our hand is high and
the lord hath not done all this
for they are a nation void of counsel neither is there any
understanding in them
o that they were wise that they understood this that they
would consider their latter end   how should one chase a
thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had
sold them and the lord had shut them up   for their rock is not
as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges
for their vine is of the vine of sodom and of the fields of
gomorrah their grapes are grapes of gall their clusters are bitter
their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of
asps
is not this laid up in store with me and sealed up among my
treasures   to me belongeth vengeance and recompence their foot
shall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand and
the things that shall come upon them make haste
for the lord shall judge his people and repent himself for his
servants when he seeth that their power is gone and there is none
shut up or left
and he shall say where are their gods their rock in whom they
trusted  which did eat the fat of their sacrifices and drank
the wine of their drink offerings let them rise up and help you and
be your protection
see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i
kill and i make alive i wound and i heal neither is there any that
can deliver out of my hand
for i lift up my hand to heaven and say i live for ever
if i whet my glittering sword and mine hand take hold on
judgment i will render vengeance to mine enemies and will reward
them that hate me
i will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall
devour flesh and that with the blood of the slain and of the
captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy
rejoice o ye nations with his people for he will avenge the
blood of his servants and will render vengeance to his adversaries
and will be merciful unto his land and to his people
and moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears
of the people he and hoshea the son of nun
and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel
and he said unto them set your hearts unto all the words which
i testify among you this day which ye shall command your children to
observe to do all the words of this law
for it is not a vain thing for you because it is your life and
through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye
go over jordan to possess it
and the lord spake unto moses that selfsame day saying
get thee up into this mountain abarim unto mount nebo which is in
the land of moab that is over against jericho and behold the land of
canaan which i give unto the children of israel for a possession
and die in the mount whither thou goest up and be gathered unto
thy people as aaron thy brother died in mount hor and was gathered
unto his people  because ye trespassed against me among the
children of israel at the waters of meribahkadesh in the wilderness
of zin because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of
israel
yet thou shalt see the land before thee but thou shalt not go
thither unto the land which i give the children of israel
and this is the blessing wherewith moses the man of god blessed
the children of israel before his death
and he said the lord came from sinai and rose up from seir unto
them he shined forth from mount paran and he came with ten thousands
of saints from his right hand went a fiery law for them
yea he loved the people all his saints are in thy hand and
they sat down at thy feet every one shall receive of thy words
moses commanded us a law even the inheritance of the
congregation of jacob
and he was king in jeshurun when the heads of the people and the
tribes of israel were gathered together
let reuben live and not die and let not his men be few
and this is the blessing of judah and he said hear lord the
voice of judah and bring him unto his people let his hands be
sufficient for him and be thou an help to him from his enemies
and of levi he said let thy thummim and thy urim be with thy
holy one whom thou didst prove at massah and with whom thou didst
strive at the waters of meribah  who said unto his father and to
his mother i have not seen him neither did he acknowledge his
brethren nor knew his own children for they have observed thy word
and kept thy covenant
they shall teach jacob thy judgments and israel thy law they
shall put incense before thee and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine
altar
bless lord his substance and accept the work of his hands
smite through the loins of them that rise against him and of them
that hate him that they rise not again
and of benjamin he said the beloved of the lord shall dwell in
safety by him and the lord shall cover him all the day long and he
shall dwell between his shoulders
and of joseph he said blessed of the lord be his land for the
precious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that coucheth
beneath  and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun
and for the precious things put forth by the moon  and for the
chief things of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of
the lasting hills  and for the precious things of the earth and
fulness thereof and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush
let the blessing come upon the head of joseph and upon the top of the
head of him that was separated from his brethren
his glory is like the firstling of his bullock and his horns
are like the horns of unicorns with them he shall push the people
together to the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands of
ephraim and they are the thousands of manasseh
and of zebulun he said rejoice zebulun in thy going out and
issachar in thy tents
they shall call the people unto the mountain there they shall
offer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck of the
abundance of the seas and of treasures hid in the sand
and of gad he said blessed be he that enlargeth gad he
dwelleth as a lion and teareth the arm with the crown of the head
and he provided the first part for himself because there in a
portion of the lawgiver was he seated and he came with the heads of
the people he executed the justice of the lord and his judgments
with israel
and of dan he said dan is a lions whelp he shall leap from
bashan
and of naphtali he said o naphtali satisfied with favour and
full with the blessing of the lord possess thou the west and the
south
and of asher he said let asher be blessed with children let
him be acceptable to his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil
thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy days so shall thy
strength be
there is none like unto the god of jeshurun who rideth upon the
heaven in thy help and in his excellency on the sky
the eternal god is thy refuge and underneath are the
everlasting arms and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee
and shall say destroy them
israel then shall dwell in safety alone the fountain of jacob
shall be upon a land of corn and wine also his heavens shall drop
down dew
happy art thou o israel who is like unto thee o people saved
by the lord the shield of thy help and who is the sword of thy
excellency and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee and thou
shalt tread upon their high places
and moses went up from the plains of moab unto the mountain of
nebo to the top of pisgah that is over against jericho and the lord
shewed him all the land of gilead unto dan  and all naphtali
and the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah unto
the utmost sea  and the south and the plain of the valley of
jericho the city of palm trees unto zoar
and the lord said unto him this is the land which i sware unto
abraham unto isaac and unto jacob saying i will give it unto thy
seed i have caused thee to see it with thine eyes but thou shalt not
go over thither
so moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab
according to the word of the lord
and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab over against
bethpeor but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day
and moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died his
eye was not dim nor his natural force abated
and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab
thirty days so the days of weeping and mourning for moses were ended
and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for
moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of israel
hearkened unto him and did as the lord commanded moses
and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moses
whom the lord knew face to face  in all the signs and the
wonders which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to
pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land  and in
all that mighty hand and in all the great terror which moses shewed
in the sight of all israel
the book of joshua
now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to
pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister
saying  moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over
this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give
to them even to the children of israel
every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have
i given unto you as i said unto moses
from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river
the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great
sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days
of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not
fail thee nor forsake thee
be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou
divide for an inheritance the land which i sware unto their fathers
to give them
only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe
to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee
turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest
prosper withersoever thou goest
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou
shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do
according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy
way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success
have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not
afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee
whithersoever thou goest
then joshua commanded the officers of the people saying
pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you
victuals for within three days ye shall pass over this jordan to go
in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you to possess
it
and to the reubenites and to the gadites and to half the tribe
of manasseh spake joshua saying  remember the word which moses
the servant of the lord commanded you saying the lord your god hath
given you rest and hath given you this land
your wives your little ones and your cattle shall remain in
the land which moses gave you on this side jordan but ye shall pass
before your brethren armed all the mighty men of valour and help
them  until the lord have given your brethren rest as he hath
given you and they also have possessed the land which the lord your
god giveth them then ye shall return unto the land of your
possession and enjoy it which moses the lords servant gave you on
this side jordan toward the sunrising
and they answered joshua saying all that thou commandest us we
will do and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go
according as we hearkened unto moses in all things so will we
hearken unto thee only the lord thy god be with thee as he was with
moses
whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment and will
not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him he shall
be put to death only be strong and of a good courage
and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men to spy
secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and
came into an harlots house named rahab and lodged there
and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came
men in hither to night of the children of israel to search out the
country
and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the
men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for
they be come to search out all the country
and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there
came men unto me but i wist not whence they were  and it came to
pass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark that
the men went out whither the men went i wot not pursue after them
quickly for ye shall overtake them
but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them
with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof
and the men pursued after them the way to jordan unto the fords
and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut
the gate
and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the
roof  and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given
you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all the
inhabitants of the land faint because of you
for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea
for you when ye came out of egypt and what ye did unto the two kings
of the amorites that were on the other side jordan sihon and og
whom ye utterly destroyed
and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt
neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you
for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth
beneath
now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i
have shewed you kindness that ye will also shew kindness unto my
fathers house and give me a true token  and that ye will save
alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and
all that they have and deliver our lives from death
and the men answered her our life for yours if ye utter not
this our business and it shall be when the lord hath given us the
land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee
then she let them down by a cord through the window for her
house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall
and she said unto them get you to the mountain lest the
pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the
pursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your way
and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine
oath which thou hast made us swear
behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of
scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou
shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy
fathers household home unto thee
and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy
house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will
be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood
shall be on our head if any hand be upon him
and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of
thine oath which thou hast made us to swear
and she said according unto your words so be it and she sent
them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the
window
and they went and came unto the mountain and abode there three
days until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them
throughout all the way but found them not
so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and
passed over and came to joshua the son of nun and told him all
things that befell them  and they said unto joshua truly the
lord hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the
inhabitants of the country do faint because of us
and joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from
shittim and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and
lodged there before they passed over
and it came to pass after three days that the officers went
through the host  and they commanded the people saying when ye
see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests the
levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after
it
yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand
cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by
which ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore
and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for to
morrow the lord will do wonders among you
and joshua spake unto the priests saying take up the ark of the
covenant and pass over before the people and they took up the ark of
the covenant and went before the people
and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify
thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was
with moses so i will be with thee
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of
jordan ye shall stand still in jordan
and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hear
the words of the lord your god
and joshua said hereby ye shall know that the living god is
among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the
canaanites and the hittites and the hivites and the perizzites and
the girgashites and the amorites and the jebusites
behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth
passeth over before you into jordan
now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel
out of every tribe a man
and it shall come to pass as soon as the soles of the feet of
the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth
shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be
cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall
stand upon an heap
and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to
pass over jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant
before the people  and as they that bare the ark were come unto
jordan and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in
the brim of the water for jordan overfloweth all his banks all the
time of harvest  that the waters which came down from above
stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city adam that is
beside zaretan and those that came down toward the sea of the plain
even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed
over right against jericho
and the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord
stood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan and all the
israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed
clean over jordan
and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over
jordan that the lord spake unto joshua saying  take you twelve
men out of the people out of every tribe a man  and command ye
them saying take you hence out of the midst of jordan out of the
place where the priests feet stood firm twelve stones and ye shall
carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where
ye shall lodge this night
then joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the
children of israel out of every tribe a man  and joshua said unto
them pass over before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of
jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder
according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel
that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their
fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones
then ye shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off
before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over
jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be
for a memorial unto the children of israel for ever
and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up
twelve stones out of the midst of jordan as the lord spake unto
joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of
israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they
lodged and laid them down there
and joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of jordan in the
place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant
stood and they are there unto this day
for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of jordan
until everything was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speak
unto the people according to all that moses commanded joshua and the
people hasted and passed over
and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over
that the ark of the lord passed over and the priests in the presence
of the people
and the children of reuben and the children of gad and half the
tribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel as
moses spake unto them  about forty thousand prepared for war
passed over before the lord unto battle to the plains of jericho
on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israel
and they feared him as they feared moses all the days of his life
and the lord spake unto joshua saying  command the priests
that bear the ark of the testimony that they come up out of jordan
joshua therefore commanded the priests saying come ye up out of
jordan
and it came to pass when the priests that bare the ark of the
covenant of the lord were come up out of the midst of jordan and the
soles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry land that the
waters of jordan returned unto their place and flowed over all his
banks as they did before
and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the
first month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho
and those twelve stones which they took out of jordan did
joshua pitch in gilgal
and he spake unto the children of israel saying when your
children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean
these stones   then ye shall let your children know saying
israel came over this jordan on dry land
for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before
you until ye were passed over as the lord your god did to the red
sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over
that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that
it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god for ever
and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which
were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the
canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up
the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were
passed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in them
any more because of the children of israel
at that time the lord said unto joshua make thee sharp knives
and circumcise again the children of israel the second time
and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of
israel at the hill of the foreskins
and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the people
that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died
in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt
now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the
people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth
out of egypt them they had not circumcised
for the children of israel walked forty years in the wilderness
till all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt
were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord unto
whom the lord sware that he would not shew them the land which the
lord sware unto their fathers that he would give us a land that
floweth with milk and honey
and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua
circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not
circumcised them by the way
and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the
people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were
whole
and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the
reproach of egypt from off you wherefore the name of the place is
called gilgal unto this day
and the children of israel encamped in gilgal and kept the
passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of
jericho
and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after
the passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day
and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
old corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna any
more but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year
and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted
up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against
him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and
said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries   and he
said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and
joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto
him what saith my lord unto his servant   and the captain of the
lords host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for
the place whereon thou standest is holy and joshua did so
now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
israel none went out and none came in
and the lord said unto joshua see i have given into thine hand
jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valour
and ye shall compass the city all ye men of war and go round
about the city once thus shalt thou do six days
and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
rams horns and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven
times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets
and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with
the rams horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the
people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall
fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight
before him
and joshua the son of nun called the priests and said unto them
take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven
trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the lord
and he said unto the people pass on and compass the city and
let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord
and it came to pass when joshua had spoken unto the people that
the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on
before the lord and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the
covenant of the lord followed them
and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
trumpets and the rereward came after the ark the priests going on
and blowing with the trumpets
and joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout
nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out
of your mouth until the day i bid you shout then shall ye shout
so the ark of the lord compassed the city going about it once
and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp
and joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the
ark of the lord
and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns before
the ark of the lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets
and the armed men went before them but the rereward came after the
ark of the lord the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets
and the second day they compassed the city once and returned
into the camp so they did six days
and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early
about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same
manner seven times only on that day they compassed the city seven
times
and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew
with the trumpets joshua said unto the people shout for the lord
hath given you the city
and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are
therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all
that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we
sent
and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest
ye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing and
make the camp of israel a curse and trouble it
but all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are
consecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the
lord
so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets
and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet
and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down
flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight
before him and they took the city
and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and
woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the
sword
but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
country go into the harlots house and bring out thence the woman
and all that she hath as ye sware unto her
and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rahab
and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she
had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the
camp of israel
and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only
the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they
put into the treasury of the house of the lord
and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive and her fathers
household and all that she had and she dwelleth in israel even unto
this day because she hid the messengers which joshua sent to spy out
jericho
and joshua adjured them at that time saying cursed be the man
before the lord that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho he
shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and in his youngest
son shall he set up the gates of it
so the lord was with joshua and his fame was noised throughout
all the country
but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursed
thing for achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of
zerah of the tribe of judah took of the accursed thing and the
anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel
and joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is beside bethaven
on the east of bethel and spake unto them saying go up and view the
country
and the men went up and viewed ai
and they returned to joshua and said unto him let not all the
people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite
ai and make not all the people to labour thither for they are but
few
so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men
and they fled before the men of ai
and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they
chased them from before the gate even unto shebarim and smote them in
the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became
as water
and joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face
before the ark of the lord until the eventide he and the elders of
israel and put dust upon their heads
and joshua said alas o lord god wherefore hast thou at all
brought this people over jordan to deliver us into the hand of the
amorites to destroy us would to god we had been content and dwelt
on the other side jordan   o lord what shall i say when israel
turneth their backs before their enemies   for the canaanites and
all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us
round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto
thy great name   and the lord said unto joshua get thee up
wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face   israel hath sinned and
they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them for
they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and
dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff
therefore the children of israel could not stand before their
enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they
were accursed neither will i be with you any more except ye destroy
the accursed from among you
up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against to
morrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there is an accursed
thing in the midst of thee o israel thou canst not stand before
thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you
in the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall
come according to the families thereof and the family which the lord
shall take shall come by households and the household which the lord
shall take shall come man by man
and it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing
shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath
transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he hath wrought
folly in israel
so joshua rose up early in the morning and brought israel by
their tribes and the tribe of judah was taken  and he brought
the family of judah and he took the family of the zarhites and he
brought the family of the zarhites man by man and zabdi was taken
and he brought his household man by man and achan the son of
carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was
taken
and joshua said unto achan my son give i pray thee glory to
the lord god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me now
what thou hast done hide it not from me
and achan answered joshua and said indeed i have sinned against
the lord god of israel and thus and thus have i done  when i saw
among the spoils a goodly babylonish garment and two hundred shekels
of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then i coveted
them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the
midst of my tent and the silver under it
so joshua sent messengers and they ran unto the tent and
behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it
and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them
unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and laid them out
before the lord
and joshua and all israel with him took achan the son of zerah
and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons
and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his
tent and all that he had and they brought them unto the valley of
achor
and joshua said why hast thou troubled us the lord shall
trouble thee this day and all israel stoned him with stones and
burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones
and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so
the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name
of that place was called the valley of achor unto this day
and the lord said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed
take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see i
have given into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his city
and his land  and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didst
unto jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle
thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush
for the city behind it
so joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against ai
and joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent
them away by night
and he commanded them saying behold ye shall lie in wait
against the city even behind the city go not very far from the city
but be ye all ready  and i and all the people that are with me
will approach unto the city and it shall come to pass when they come
out against us as at the first that we will flee before them
for they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the
city for they will say they flee before us as at the first
therefore we will flee before them
then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city
for the lord your god will deliver it into your hand
and it shall be when ye have taken the city that ye shall set
the city on fire according to the commandment of the lord shall ye
do see i have commanded you
joshua therefore sent them forth and they went to lie in ambush
and abode between bethel and ai on the west side of ai but joshua
lodged that night among the people
and joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the people
and went up he and the elders of israel before the people to ai
and all the people even the people of war that were with him
went up and drew nigh and came before the city and pitched on the
north side of ai now there was a valley between them and ai
and he took about five thousand men and set them to lie in
ambush between bethel and ai on the west side of the city
and when they had set the people even all the host that was on
the north of the city and their liers in wait on the west of the
city joshua went that night into the midst of the valley
and it came to pass when the king of ai saw it that they hasted
and rose up early and the men of the city went out against israel to
battle he and all his people at a time appointed before the plain
but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the
city
and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before
them and fled by the way of the wilderness
and all the people that were in ai were called together to pursue
after them and they pursued after joshua and were drawn away from
the city
and there was not a man left in ai or bethel that went not out
after israel and they left the city open and pursued after israel
and the lord said unto joshua stretch out the spear that is in
thy hand toward ai for i will give it into thine hand and joshua
stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place and they ran as
soon as he had stretched out his hand and they entered into the city
and took it and hasted and set the city on fire
and when the men of ai looked behind them they saw and behold
the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven and they had no power to
flee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wilderness
turned back upon the pursuers
and when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had taken the
city and that the smoke of the city ascended then they turned again
and slew the men of ai
and the other issued out of the city against them so they were
in the midst of israel some on this side and some on that side and
they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape
and the king of ai they took alive and brought him to joshua
and it came to pass when israel had made an end of slaying all
the inhabitants of ai in the field in the wilderness wherein they
chased them and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword
until they were consumed that all the israelites returned unto ai
and smote it with the edge of the sword
and so it was that all that fell that day both of men and
women were twelve thousand even all the men of ai
for joshua drew not his hand back wherewith he stretched out the
spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai
only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for a prey
unto themselves according unto the word of the lord which he
commanded joshua
and joshua burnt ai and made it an heap for ever even a
desolation unto this day
and the king of ai he hanged on a tree until eventide and as
soon as the sun was down joshua commanded that they should take his
carcase down from the tree and cast it at the entering of the gate of
the city and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remaineth
unto this day
then joshua built an altar unto the lord god of israel in mount
ebal  as moses the servant of the lord commanded the children of
israel as it is written in the book of the law of moses an altar of
whole stones over which no man hath lift up any iron and they
offered thereon burnt offerings unto the lord and sacrificed peace
offerings
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses
which he wrote in the presence of the children of israel
and all israel and their elders and officers and their judges
stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the
levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord as well the
stranger as he that was born among them half of them over against
mount gerizim and half of them over against mount ebal as moses the
servant of the lord had commanded before that they should bless the
people of israel
and afterward he read all the words of the law the blessings and
cursings according to all that is written in the book of the law
there was not a word of all that moses commanded which joshua
read not before all the congregation of israel with the women and
the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them
and it came to pass when all the kings which were on this side
jordan in the hills and in the valleys and in all the coasts of the
great sea over against lebanon the hittite and the amorite the
canaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite heard thereof
that they gathered themselves together to fight with joshua and
with israel with one accord
and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto
jericho and to ai  they did work wilily and went and made as if
they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and
wine bottles old and rent and bound up  and old shoes and
clouted upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread
of their provision was dry and mouldy
and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said unto
him and to the men of israel we be come from a far country now
therefore make ye a league with us
and the men of israel said unto the hivites peradventure ye dwell
among us and how shall we make a league with you   and they said
unto joshua we are thy servants and joshua said unto them who are
ye and from whence come ye   and they said unto him from a very
far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy
god for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in egypt
and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that were
beyond jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan
which was at ashtaroth
wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake
to us saying take victuals with you for the journey and go to meet
them and say unto them we are your servants therefore now make ye a
league with us
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on
the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and
it is mouldy  and these bottles of wine which we filled were
new and behold they be rent and these our garments and our shoes
are become old by reason of the very long journey
and the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the
mouth of the lord
and joshua made peace with them and made a league with them to
let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them
and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made
a league with them that they heard that they were their neighbours
and that they dwelt among them
and the children of israel journeyed and came unto their cities
on the third day now their cities were gibeon and chephirah and
beeroth and kirjathjearim
and the children of israel smote them not because the princes of
the congregation had sworn unto them by the lord god of israel and
all the congregation murmured against the princes
but all the princes said unto all the congregation we have sworn
unto them by the lord god of israel now therefore we may not touch
them
this we will do to them we will even let them live lest wrath
be upon us because of the oath which we sware unto them
and the princes said unto them let them live but let them be
hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as the
princes had promised them
and joshua called for them and he spake unto them saying
wherefore have ye beguiled us saying we are very far from you when
ye dwell among us   now therefore ye are cursed and there shall
none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and
drawers of water for the house of my god
and they answered joshua and said because it was certainly told
thy servants how that the lord thy god commanded his servant moses to
give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land
from before you therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of
you and have done this thing
and now behold we are in thine hand as it seemeth good and
right unto thee to do unto us do
and so did he unto them and delivered them out of the hand of
the children of israel that they slew them not
and joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water
for the congregation and for the altar of the lord even unto this
day in the place which he should choose
now it came to pass when adonizedec king of jerusalem had heard
how joshua had taken ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done
to jericho and her king so he had done to ai and her king and how
the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel and were among
them  that they feared greatly because gibeon was a great city
as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than ai and
all the men thereof were mighty
wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of
hebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king of
lachish and unto debir king of eglon saying  come up unto me
and help me that we may smite gibeon for it hath made peace with
joshua and with the children of israel
therefore the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem
the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish the king
of eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and all
their hosts and encamped before gibeon and made war against it
and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal
saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly
and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell
in the mountains are gathered together against us
so joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people of war
with him and all the mighty men of valour
and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i have
delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand
before thee
joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal
all night
and the lord discomfited them before israel and slew them with
a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth
up to bethhoron and smote them to azekah and unto makkedah
and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and were
in the going down to bethhoron that the lord cast down great stones
from heaven upon them unto azekah and they died they were more which
died with hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew with
the sword
then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered
up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the
sight of israel sun stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in
the valley of ajalon
and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people
had avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the
book of jasher so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and
hasted not to go down about a whole day
and there was no day like that before it or after it that the
lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for
israel
and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to
gilgal
but these five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at
makkedah
and it was told joshua saying the five kings are found hid in
a cave at makkedah
and joshua said roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave
and set men by it for to keep them  and stay ye not but pursue
after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not to
enter into their cities for the lord your god hath delivered them
into your hand
and it came to pass when joshua and the children of israel had
made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they
were consumed that the rest which remained of them entered into
fenced cities
and all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah in
peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel
then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring out
those five kings unto me out of the cave
and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out
of the cave the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of
jarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon
and it came to pass when they brought out those kings unto
joshua that joshua called for all the men of israel and said unto
the captains of the men of war which went with him come near put
your feet upon the necks of these kings and they came near and put
their feet upon the necks of them
and joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong
and of good courage for thus shall the lord do to all your enemies
against whom ye fight
and afterward joshua smote them and slew them and hanged them
on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening
and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun
that joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and cast
them into the cave wherein they had been hid and laid great stones in
the caves mouth which remain until this very day
and that day joshua took makkedah and smote it with the edge of
the sword and the king thereof he utterly destroyed them and all
the souls that were therein he let none remain and he did to the
king of makkedah as he did unto the king of jericho
then joshua passed from makkedah and all israel with him unto
libnah and fought against libnah  and the lord delivered it
also and the king thereof into the hand of israel and he smote it
with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he
let none remain in it but did unto the king thereof as he did unto
the king of jericho
and joshua passed from libnah and all israel with him unto
lachish and encamped against it and fought against it  and the
lord delivered lachish into the hand of israel which took it on the
second day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls
that were therein according to all that he had done to libnah
then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish and joshua
smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining
and from lachish joshua passed unto eglon and all israel with
him and they encamped against it and fought against it  and
they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword and
all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day
according to all that he had done to lachish
and joshua went up from eglon and all israel with him unto
hebron and they fought against it  and they took it and smote
it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof and all the
cities thereof and all the souls that were therein he left none
remaining according to all that he had done to eglon but destroyed
it utterly and all the souls that were therein
and joshua returned and all israel with him to debir and
fought against it  and he took it and the king thereof and all
the cities thereof and they smote them with the edge of the sword
and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein he left none
remaining as he had done to hebron so he did to debir and to the
king thereof as he had done also to libnah and to her king
so joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the south
and of the vale and of the springs and all their kings he left none
remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathed as the lord god of
israel commanded
and joshua smote them from kadeshbarnea even unto gaza and all
the country of goshen even unto gibeon
and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one time
because the lord god of israel fought for israel
and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to
gilgal
and it came to pass when jabin king of hazor had heard those
things that he sent to jobab king of madon and to the king of
shimron and to the king of achshaph  and to the kings that were
on the north of the mountains and of the plains south of chinneroth
and in the valley and in the borders of dor on the west  and to
the canaanite on the east and on the west and to the amorite and the
hittite and the perizzite and the jebusite in the mountains and to
the hivite under hermon in the land of mizpeh
and they went out they and all their hosts with them much
people even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude with
horses and chariots very many
and when all these kings were met together they came and pitched
together at the waters of merom to fight against israel
and the lord said unto joshua be not afraid because of them for
to morrow about this time will i deliver them up all slain before
israel thou shalt hough their horses and burn their chariots with
fire
so joshua came and all the people of war with him against them
by the waters of merom suddenly and they fell upon them
and the lord delivered them into the hand of israel who smote
them and chased them unto great zidon and unto misrephothmaim and
unto the valley of mizpeh eastward and they smote them until they
left them none remaining
and joshua did unto them as the lord bade him he houghed their
horses and burnt their chariots with fire
and joshua at that time turned back and took hazor and smote
the king thereof with the sword for hazor beforetime was the head of
all those kingdoms
and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of
the sword utterly destroying them there was not any left to breathe
and he burnt hazor with fire
and all the cities of those kings and all the kings of them
did joshua take and smote them with the edge of the sword and he
utterly destroyed them as moses the servant of the lord commanded
but as for the cities that stood still in their strength israel
burned none of them save hazor only that did joshua burn
and all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the children
of israel took for a prey unto themselves but every man they smote
with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them neither
left they any to breathe
as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses command
joshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone of all that the lord
commanded moses
so joshua took all that land the hills and all the south
country and all the land of goshen and the valley and the plain
and the mountain of israel and the valley of the same  even
from the mount halak that goeth up to seir even unto baalgad in the
valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he took and
smote them and slew them
joshua made war a long time with all those kings
there was not a city that made peace with the children of
israel save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon all other they
took in battle
for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they should
come against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly and
that they might have no favour but that he might destroy them as the
lord commanded moses
and at that time came joshua and cut off the anakims from the
mountains from hebron from debir from anab and from all the
mountains of judah and from all the mountains of israel joshua
destroyed them utterly with their cities
there was none of the anakims left in the land of the children
of israel only in gaza in gath and in ashdod there remained
so joshua took the whole land according to all that the lord
said unto moses and joshua gave it for an inheritance unto israel
according to their divisions by their tribes and the land rested from
war
now these are the kings of the land which the children of israel
smote and possessed their land on the other side jordan toward the
rising of the sun from the river arnon unto mount hermon and all the
plain on the east  sihon king of the amorites who dwelt in
heshbon and ruled from aroer which is upon the bank of the river
arnon and from the middle of the river and from half gilead even
unto the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon
and from the plain to the sea of chinneroth on the east and unto
the sea of the plain even the salt sea on the east the way to
bethjeshimoth and from the south under ashdothpisgah  and the
coast of og king of bashan which was of the remnant of the giants
that dwelt at ashtaroth and at edrei  and reigned in mount
hermon and in salcah and in all bashan unto the border of the
geshurites and the maachathites and half gilead the border of sihon
king of heshbon
them did moses the servant of the lord and the children of israel
smite and moses the servant of the lord gave it for a possession unto
the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh
and these are the kings of the country which joshua and the
children of israel smote on this side jordan on the west from baalgad
in the valley of lebanon even unto the mount halak that goeth up to
seir which joshua gave unto the tribes of israel for a possession
according to their divisions  in the mountains and in the
valleys and in the plains and in the springs and in the wilderness
and in the south country the hittites the amorites and the
canaanites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites  the
king of jericho one the king of ai which is beside bethel one
the king of jerusalem one the king of hebron one  the
king of jarmuth one the king of lachish one  the king of
eglon one the king of gezer one  the king of debir one the
king of geder one  the king of hormah one the king of arad
one  the king of libnah one the king of adullam one
the king of makkedah one the king of bethel one  the king of
tappuah one the king of hepher one  the king of aphek one
the king of lasharon one  the king of madon one the king of
hazor one  the king of shimronmeron one the king of achshaph
one  the king of taanach one the king of megiddo one
the king of kedesh one the king of jokneam of carmel one  the
king of dor in the coast of dor one the king of the nations of
gilgal one  the king of tirzah one all the kings thirty and
one
now joshua was old and stricken in years and the lord said unto
him thou art old and stricken in years and there remaineth yet very
much land to be possessed
this is the land that yet remaineth all the borders of the
philistines and all geshuri  from sihor which is before egypt
even unto the borders of ekron northward which is counted to the
canaanite five lords of the philistines the gazathites and the
ashdothites the eshkalonites the gittites and the ekronites also
the avites  from the south all the land of the canaanites and
mearah that is beside the sidonians unto aphek to the borders of the
amorites  and the land of the giblites and all lebanon toward
the sunrising from baalgad under mount hermon unto the entering into
hamath
all the inhabitants of the hill country from lebanon unto
misrephothmaim and all the sidonians them will i drive out from
before the children of israel only divide thou it by lot unto the
israelites for an inheritance as i have commanded thee
now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine
tribes and the half tribe of manasseh  with whom the reubenites
and the gadites have received their inheritance which moses gave
them beyond jordan eastward even as moses the servant of the lord
gave them  from aroer that is upon the bank of the river arnon
and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain of
medeba unto dibon  and all the cities of sihon king of the
amorites which reigned in heshbon unto the border of the children of
ammon  and gilead and the border of the geshurites and
maachathites and all mount hermon and all bashan unto salcah
all the kingdom of og in bashan which reigned in ashtaroth and in
edrei who remained of the remnant of the giants for these did moses
smite and cast them out
nevertheless the children of israel expelled not the geshurites
nor the maachathites but the geshurites and the maachathites dwell
among the israelites until this day
only unto the tribes of levi he gave none inheritance the
sacrifices of the lord god of israel made by fire are their
inheritance as he said unto them
and moses gave unto the tribe of the children of reuben
inheritance according to their families
and their coast was from aroer that is on the bank of the river
arnon and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the
plain by medeba  heshbon and all her cities that are in the
plain dibon and bamothbaal and bethbaalmeon  and jahaza and
kedemoth and mephaath  and kirjathaim and sibmah and
zarethshahar in the mount of the valley  and bethpeor and
ashdothpisgah and bethjeshimoth  and all the cities of the
plain and all the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites which
reigned in heshbon whom moses smote with the princes of midian evi
and rekem and zur and hur and reba which were dukes of sihon
dwelling in the country
balaam also the son of beor the soothsayer did the children of
israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them
and the border of the children of reuben was jordan and the
border thereof this was the inheritance of the children of reuben
after their families the cities and the villages thereof
and moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of gad even unto the
children of gad according to their families
and their coast was jazer and all the cities of gilead and
half the land of the children of ammon unto aroer that is before
rabbah  and from heshbon unto ramathmizpeh and betonim and
from mahanaim unto the border of debir  and in the valley
betharam and bethnimrah and succoth and zaphon the rest of the
kingdom of sihon king of heshbon jordan and his border even unto the
edge of the sea of chinnereth on the other side jordan eastward
this is the inheritance of the children of gad after their
families the cities and their villages
and moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of manasseh and
this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of manasseh
by their families
and their coast was from mahanaim all bashan all the kingdom
of og king of bashan and all the towns of jair which are in bashan
threescore cities  and half gilead and ashtaroth and edrei
cities of the kingdom of og in bashan were pertaining unto the
children of machir the son of manasseh even to the one half of the
children of machir by their families
these are the countries which moses did distribute for
inheritance in the plains of moab on the other side jordan by
jericho eastward
but unto the tribe of levi moses gave not any inheritance the
lord god of israel was their inheritance as he said unto them
and these are the countries which the children of israel
inherited in the land of canaan which eleazar the priest and joshua
the son of nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the
children of israel distributed for inheritance to them
by lot was their inheritance as the lord commanded by the hand
of moses for the nine tribes and for the half tribe
for moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
tribe on the other side jordan but unto the levites he gave none
inheritance among them
for the children of joseph were two tribes manasseh and ephraim
therefore they gave no part unto the levites in the land save cities
to dwell in with their suburbs for their cattle and for their
substance
as the lord commanded moses so the children of israel did and
they divided the land
then the children of judah came unto joshua in gilgal and caleb
the son of jephunneh the kenezite said unto him thou knowest the
thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and
thee in kadeshbarnea
forty years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me
from kadeshbarnea to espy out the land and i brought him word again
as it was in mine heart
nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of
the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god
and moses sware on that day saying surely the land whereon thy
feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy childrens for
ever because thou hast wholly followed the lord my god
and now behold the lord hath kept me alive as he said these
forty and five years even since the lord spake this word unto moses
while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo
i am this day fourscore and five years old
as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses
sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war
both to go out and to come in
now therefore give me this mountain whereof the lord spake in
that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were there
and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be
with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said
and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of jephunneh
hebron for an inheritance
hebron therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of
jephunneh the kenezite unto this day because that he wholly followed
the lord god of israel
and the name of hebron before was kirjatharba which arba was a
great man among the anakims and the land had rest from war
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of judah by
their families even to the border of edom the wilderness of zin
southward was the uttermost part of the south coast
and their south border was from the shore of the salt sea from
the bay that looketh southward  and it went out to the south side
to maalehacrabbim and passed along to zin and ascended up on the
south side unto kadeshbarnea and passed along to hezron and went up
to adar and fetched a compass to karkaa  from thence it passed
toward azmon and went out unto the river of egypt and the goings out
of that coast were at the sea this shall be your south coast
and the east border was the salt sea even unto the end of
jordan
and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at
the uttermost part of jordan  and the border went up to
bethhogla and passed along by the north of betharabah and the border
went up to the stone of bohan the son of reuben  and the border
went up toward debir from the valley of achor and so northward
looking toward gilgal that is before the going up to adummim which
is on the south side of the river and the border passed toward the
waters of enshemesh and the goings out thereof were at enrogel
and the border went up by the valley of the son of hinnom unto the
south side of the jebusite the same is jerusalem and the border went
up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of hinnom
westward which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward
and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
fountain of the water of nephtoah and went out to the cities of mount
ephron and the border was drawn to baalah which is kirjathjearim
and the border compassed from baalah westward unto mount seir
and passed along unto the side of mount jearim which is chesalon on
the north side and went down to bethshemesh and passed on to timnah
and the border went out unto the side of ekron northward and
the border was drawn to shicron and passed along to mount baalah and
went out unto jabneel and the goings out of the border were at the
sea
and the west border was to the great sea and the coast thereof
this is the coast of the children of judah round about according to
their families
and unto caleb the son of jephunneh he gave a part among the
children of judah according to the commandment of the lord to joshua
even the city of arba the father of anak which city is hebron
and caleb drove thence the three sons of anak sheshai and
ahiman and talmai the children of anak
and he went up thence to the inhabitants of debir and the name
of debir before was kirjathsepher
and caleb said he that smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to
him will i give achsah my daughter to wife
and othniel the son of kenaz the brother of caleb took it and
he gave him achsah his daughter to wife
and it came to pass as she came unto him that she moved him to
ask of her father a field and she lighted off her ass and caleb said
unto her what wouldest thou   who answered give me a blessing
for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of water
and he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of judah
according to their families
and the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of judah
toward the coast of edom southward were kabzeel and eder and jagur
and kinah and dimonah and adadah  and kedesh and hazor
and ithnan  ziph and telem and bealoth  and hazor
hadattah and kerioth and hezron which is hazor  amam and

as for the jebusites the inhabitants of jerusalem the children

children of judah at jerusalem unto this day
and the lot of the children of joseph fell from jordan by
jericho unto the water of jericho on the east to the wilderness that
goeth up from jericho throughout mount bethel  and goeth out from
bethel to luz and passeth along unto the borders of archi to ataroth
and goeth down westward to the coast of japhleti unto the coast
of bethhoron the nether and to gezer and the goings out thereof are
at the sea
so the children of joseph manasseh and ephraim took their
inheritance
and the border of the children of ephraim according to their
families was thus even the border of their inheritance on the east
side was atarothaddar unto bethhoron the upper  and the border
went out toward the sea to michmethah on the north side and the
border went about eastward unto taanathshiloh and passed by it on the
east to janohah  and it went down from janohah to ataroth and to
naarath and came to jericho and went out at jordan
the border went out from tappuah westward unto the river kanah
and the goings out thereof were at the sea this is the inheritance of
the tribe of the children of ephraim by their families
and the separate cities for the children of ephraim were among
the inheritance of the children of manasseh all the cities with their
villages
and they drave not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but
the canaanites dwell among the ephraimites unto this day and serve
under tribute
there was also a lot for the tribe of manasseh for he was the
firstborn of joseph to wit for machir the firstborn of manasseh the
father of gilead because he was a man of war therefore he had gilead
and bashan
there was also a lot for the rest of the children of manasseh by
their families for the children of abiezer and for the children of
helek and for the children of asriel and for the children of
shechem and for the children of hepher and for the children of
shemida these were the male children of manasseh the son of joseph by
their families
but zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of
machir the son of manasseh had no sons but daughters and these are
the names of his daughters mahlah and noah hoglah milcah and
tirzah
and they came near before eleazar the priest and before joshua
the son of nun and before the princes saying the lord commanded
moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren therefore
according to the commandment of the lord he gave them an inheritance
among the brethren of their father
and there fell ten portions to manasseh beside the land of
gilead and bashan which were on the other side jordan  because
the daughters of manasseh had an inheritance among his sons and the
rest of manassehs sons had the land of gilead
and the coast of manasseh was from asher to michmethah that
lieth before shechem and the border went along on the right hand unto
the inhabitants of entappuah
now manasseh had the land of tappuah but tappuah on the border
of manasseh belonged to the children of ephraim  and the coast
descended unto the river kanah southward of the river these cities
of ephraim are among the cities of manasseh the coast of manasseh
also was on the north side of the river and the outgoings of it were
at the sea  southward it was ephraims and northward it was
manassehs and the sea is his border and they met together in asher
on the north and in issachar on the east
and manasseh had in issachar and in asher bethshean and her
towns and ibleam and her towns and the inhabitants of dor and her
towns and the inhabitants of endor and her towns and the inhabitants
of taanach and her towns and the inhabitants of megiddo and her
towns even three countries
yet the children of manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants
of those cities but the canaanites would dwell in that land
yet it came to pass when the children of israel were waxen
strong that they put the canaanites to tribute but did not utterly
drive them out
and the children of joseph spake unto joshua saying why hast
thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing i am a
great people forasmuch as the lord hath blessed me hitherto
and joshua answered them if thou be a great people then get thee up
to the wood country and cut down for thyself there in the land of the
perizzites and of the giants if mount ephraim be too narrow for thee
and the children of joseph said the hill is not enough for us
and all the canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have
chariots of iron both they who are of bethshean and her towns and
they who are of the valley of jezreel
and joshua spake unto the house of joseph even to ephraim and
to manasseh saying thou art a great people and hast great power
thou shalt not have one lot only  but the mountain shall be
thine for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoings
of it shall be thine for thou shalt drive out the canaanites though
they have iron chariots and though they be strong
and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled
together at shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation
there and the land was subdued before them
and there remained among the children of israel seven tribes
which had not yet received their inheritance
and joshua said unto the children of israel how long are ye
slack to go to possess the land which the lord god of your fathers
hath given you   give out from among you three men for each
tribe and i will send them and they shall rise and go through the
land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they
shall come again to me
and they shall divide it into seven parts judah shall abide in
their coast on the south and the house of joseph shall abide in their
coasts on the north
ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts and bring
the description hither to me that i may cast lots for you here before
the lord our god
but the levites have no part among you for the priesthood of the
lord is their inheritance and gad and reuben and half the tribe of
manasseh have received their inheritance beyond jordan on the east
which moses the servant of the lord gave them
and the men arose and went away and joshua charged them that
went to describe the land saying go and walk through the land and
describe it and come again to me that i may here cast lots for you
before the lord in shiloh
and the men went and passed through the land and described it by
cities into seven parts in a book and came again to joshua to the
host at shiloh
and joshua cast lots for them in shiloh before the lord and
there joshua divided the land unto the children of israel according to
their divisions

thus were all these cities
and the lord gave unto israel all the land which he sware to
give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein
and the lord gave them rest round about according to all that
he sware unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their
enemies before them the lord delivered all their enemies into their
hand
there failed not ought of any good thing which the lord had
spoken unto the house of israel all came to pass
then joshua called the reubenites and the gadites and the half
tribe of manasseh  and said unto them ye have kept all that
moses the servant of the lord commanded you and have obeyed my voice
in all that i commanded you  ye have not left your brethren these
many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandment
of the lord your god
and now the lord your god hath given rest unto your brethren as
he promised them therefore now return ye and get you unto your
tents and unto the land of your possession which moses the servant
of the lord gave you on the other side jordan
but take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which
moses the servant of the lord charged you to love the lord your god
and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to
cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all
your soul
so joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went unto
their tents
now to the one half of the tribe of manasseh moses had given
possession in bashan but unto the other half thereof gave joshua
among their brethren on this side jordan westward and when joshua
sent them away also unto their tents then he blessed them  and
he spake unto them saying return with much riches unto your tents
and with very much cattle with silver and with gold and with brass
and with iron and with very much raiment divide the spoil of your
enemies with your brethren
and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half
tribe of manasseh returned and departed from the children of israel
out of shiloh which is in the land of canaan to go unto the country
of gilead to the land of their possession whereof they were
possessed according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses
and when they came unto the borders of jordan that are in the
land of canaan the children of reuben and the children of gad and the
half tribe of manasseh built there an altar by jordan a great altar
to see to
and the children of israel heard say behold the children of
reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have
built an altar over against the land of canaan in the borders of
jordan at the passage of the children of israel
and when the children of israel heard of it the whole
congregation of the children of israel gathered themselves together at
shiloh to go up to war against them
and the children of israel sent unto the children of reuben and
to the children of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh into the
land of gilead phinehas the son of eleazar the priest  and with
him ten princes of each chief house a prince throughout all the
tribes of israel and each one was an head of the house of their
fathers among the thousands of israel
and they came unto the children of reuben and to the children
of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh unto the land of gilead
and they spake with them saying  thus saith the whole
congregation of the lord what trespass is this that ye have committed
against the god of israel to turn away this day from following the
lord in that ye have builded you an altar that ye might rebel this
day against the lord   is the iniquity of peor too little for
us from which we are not cleansed until this day although there was
a plague in the congregation of the lord  but that ye must turn
away this day from following the lord and it will be seeing ye rebel
to day against the lord that to morrow he will be wroth with the
whole congregation of israel
notwithstanding if the land of your possession be unclean then
pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the lord wherein the
lords tabernacle dwelleth and take possession among us but rebel
not against the lord nor rebel against us in building you an altar
beside the altar of the lord our god
did not achan the son of zerah commit a trespass in the accursed
thing and wrath fell on all the congregation of israel and that man
perished not alone in his iniquity
then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half
tribe of manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands
of israel  the lord god of gods the lord god of gods he
knoweth and israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in
transgression against the lord save us not this day  that we
have built us an altar to turn from following the lord or if to offer
thereon burnt offering or meat offering or if to offer peace
offerings thereon let the lord himself require it  and if we
have not rather done it for fear of this thing saying in time to
come your children might speak unto our children saying what have ye
to do with the lord god of israel   for the lord hath made
jordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and children
of gad ye have no part in the lord so shall your children make our
children cease from fearing the lord
therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not
for burnt offering nor for sacrifice  but that it may be a
witness between us and you and our generations after us that we
might do the service of the lord before him with our burnt offerings
and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your
children may not say to our children in time to come ye have no part
in the lord
therefore said we that it shall be when they should so say to
us or to our generations in time to come that we may say again
behold the pattern of the altar of the lord which our fathers made
not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it is a witness
between us and you
god forbid that we should rebel against the lord and turn this
day from following the lord to build an altar for burnt offerings
for meat offerings or for sacrifices beside the altar of the lord
our god that is before his tabernacle
and when phinehas the priest and the princes of the
congregation and heads of the thousands of israel which were with him
heard the words that the children of reuben and the children of gad
and the children of manasseh spake it pleased them
and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said unto the
children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the children of
manasseh this day we perceive that the lord is among us because ye
have not committed this trespass against the lord now ye have
delivered the children of israel out of the hand of the lord
and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and the princes
returned from the children of reuben and from the children of gad
out of the land of gilead unto the land of canaan to the children of
israel and brought them word again
and the thing pleased the children of israel and the children
of israel blessed god and did not intend to go up against them in
battle to destroy the land wherein the children of reuben and gad
dwelt
and the children of reuben and the children of gad called the
altar ed for it shall be a witness between us that the lord is god
and it came to pass a long time after that the lord had given
rest unto israel from all their enemies round about that joshua waxed
old and stricken in age
and joshua called for all israel and for their elders and for
their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said
unto them i am old and stricken in age  and ye have seen all
that the lord your god hath done unto all these nations because of
you for the lord your god is he that hath fought for you
behold i have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain
to be an inheritance for your tribes from jordan with all the
nations that i have cut off even unto the great sea westward
and the lord your god he shall expel them from before you and
drive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as
the lord your god hath promised unto you
be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is
written in the book of the law of moses that ye turn not aside
therefrom to the right hand or to the left  that ye come not
among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention
of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve
them nor bow yourselves unto them  but cleave unto the lord your
god as ye have done unto this day
for the lord hath driven out from before you great nations and
strong but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you unto
this day
one man of you shall chase a thousand for the lord your god he
it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you
take good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love the lord
your god
else if ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant
of these nations even these that remain among you and shall make
marriages with them and go in unto them and they to you  know
for a certainty that the lord your god will no more drive out any of
these nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps unto
you and scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes until ye
perish from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you
and behold this day i am going the way of all the earth and
ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing
hath failed of all the good things which the lord your god spake
concerning you all are come to pass unto you and not one thing hath
failed thereof
therefore it shall come to pass that as all good things are
come upon you which the lord your god promised you so shall the lord
bring upon you all evil things until he have destroyed you from off
this good land which the lord your god hath given you
when ye have transgressed the covenant of the lord your god
which he commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowed
yourselves to them then shall the anger of the lord be kindled
against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which
he hath given unto you
and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel to shechem and
called for the elders of israel and for their heads and for their
judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before
god
and joshua said unto all the people thus saith the lord god of
israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time
even terah the father of abraham and the father of nachor and they
served other gods
and i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood
and led him throughout all the land of canaan and multiplied his
seed and gave him isaac
and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau and i gave unto esau mount
seir to possess it but jacob and his children went down into egypt
i sent moses also and aaron and i plagued egypt according to
that which i did among them and afterward i brought you out
and i brought your fathers out of egypt and ye came unto the
sea and the egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and
horsemen unto the red sea
and when they cried unto the lord he put darkness between you
and the egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them
and your eyes have seen what i have done in egypt and ye dwelt in the
wilderness a long season
and i brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt on
the other side jordan and they fought with you and i gave them into
your hand that ye might possess their land and i destroyed them from
before you
then balak the son of zippor king of moab arose and warred
against israel and sent and called balaam the son of beor to curse
you  but i would not hearken unto balaam therefore he blessed
you still so i delivered you out of his hand
and you went over jordan and came unto jericho and the men of
jericho fought against you the amorites and the perizzites and the
canaanites and the hittites and the girgashites the hivites and
the jebusites and i delivered them into your hand
and i sent the hornet before you which drave them out from
before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy
sword nor with thy bow
and i have given you a land for which ye did not labour and
cities which ye built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyards and
oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat
now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in
truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other
side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord
and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this
day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers served
that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites
in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the
lord
and the people answered and said god forbid that we should
forsake the lord to serve other gods  for the lord our god he
it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt
from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our
sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all
the people through whom we passed  and the lord drave out from
before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land
therefore will we also serve the lord for he is our god
and joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the lord for
he is an holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your
transgressions nor your sins
if ye forsake the lord and serve strange gods then he will
turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done you
good
and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the
lord
and joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against
yourselves that ye have chosen you the lord to serve him and they
said we are witnesses
now therefore put away said he the strange gods which are
among you and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel
and the people said unto joshua the lord our god will we serve
and his voice will we obey
so joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them
a statute and an ordinance in shechem
and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god and
took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the
sanctuary of the lord
and joshua said unto all the people behold this stone shall be
a witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the lord which
he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye
deny your god
so joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance
and it came to pass after these things that joshua the son of
nun the servant of the lord died being an hundred and ten years
old
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
timnathserah which is in mount ephraim on the north side of the hill
of gaash
and israel served the lord all the days of joshua and all the
days of the elders that overlived joshua and which had known all the
works of the lord that he had done for israel
and the bones of joseph which the children of israel brought up
out of egypt buried they in shechem in a parcel of ground which
jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for an hundred
pieces of silver and it became the inheritance of the children of
joseph
and eleazar the son of aaron died and they buried him in a hill
that pertained to phinehas his son which was given him in mount
ephraim
the book of judges
now after the death of joshua it came to pass that the children
of israel asked the lord saying who shall go up for us against the
canaanites first to fight against them   and the lord said judah
shall go up behold i have delivered the land into his hand
and judah said unto simeon his brother come up with me into my
lot that we may fight against the canaanites and i likewise will go
with thee into thy lot so simeon went with him
and judah went up and the lord delivered the canaanites and the
perizzites into their hand and they slew of them in bezek ten
thousand men
and they found adonibezek in bezek and they fought against him
and they slew the canaanites and the perizzites
but adonibezek fled and they pursued after him and caught him
and cut off his thumbs and his great toes
and adonibezek said threescore and ten kings having their thumbs
and their great toes cut off gathered their meat under my table as i
have done so god hath requited me and they brought him to jerusalem
and there he died
now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem and had
taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city
on fire
and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the
canaanites that dwelt in the mountain and in the south and in the
valley
and judah went against the canaanites that dwelt in hebron now
the name of hebron before was kirjatharba and they slew sheshai and
ahiman and talmai
and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir and the
name of debir before was kirjathsepher  and caleb said he that
smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my
daughter to wife
and othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother took it
and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife
and it came to pass when she came to him that she moved him to
ask of her father a field and she lighted from off her ass and caleb
said unto her what wilt thou   and she said unto him give me a
blessing for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of
water and caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs
and the children of the kenite moses father in law went up out
of the city of palm trees with the children of judah into the
wilderness of judah which lieth in the south of arad and they went
and dwelt among the people
and judah went with simeon his brother and they slew the
canaanites that inhabited zephath and utterly destroyed it and the
name of the city was called hormah
also judah took gaza with the coast thereof and askelon with the
coast thereof and ekron with the coast thereof
and the lord was with judah and he drave out the inhabitants of
the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley
because they had chariots of iron
and they gave hebron unto caleb as moses said and he expelled
thence the three sons of anak
and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that
inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of
benjamin in jerusalem unto this day
and the house of joseph they also went up against bethel and
the lord was with them
and the house of joseph sent to descry bethel now the name of
the city before was luz   and the spies saw a man come forth out
of the city and they said unto him shew us we pray thee the
entrance into the city and we will shew thee mercy
and when he shewed them the entrance into the city they smote
the city with the edge of the sword but they let go the man and all
his family
and the man went into the land of the hittites and built a city
and called the name thereof luz which is the name thereof unto this
day
neither did manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethshean and
her towns nor taanach and her towns nor the inhabitants of dor and
her towns nor the inhabitants of ibleam and her towns nor the
inhabitants of megiddo and her towns but the canaanites would dwell
in that land
and it came to pass when israel was strong that they put the
canaanites to tribute and did not utterly drive them out
neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer
but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them
neither did zebulun drive out the inhabitants of kitron nor the
inhabitants of nahalol but the canaanites dwelt among them and
became tributaries
neither did asher drive out the inhabitants of accho nor the
inhabitants of zidon nor of ahlab nor of achzib nor of helbah nor
of aphik nor of rehob  but the asherites dwelt among the
canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them
out
neither did naphtali drive out the inhabitants of bethshemesh
nor the inhabitants of bethanath but he dwelt among the canaanites
the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of
bethshemesh and of bethanath became tributaries unto them
and the amorites forced the children of dan into the mountain
for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley  but
the amorites would dwell in mount heres in aijalon and in shaalbim
yet the hand of the house of joseph prevailed so that they became
tributaries
and the coast of the amorites was from the going up to akrabbim
from the rock and upward
and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim and said
i made you to go up out of egypt and have brought you unto the land
which i sware unto your fathers and i said i will never break my
covenant with you
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ye
shall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice why
have ye done this   wherefore i also said i will not drive them
out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and
their gods shall be a snare unto you
and it came to pass when the angel of the lord spake these words
unto all the children of israel that the people lifted up their
voice and wept
and they called the name of that place bochim and they sacrificed
there unto the lord
and when joshua had let the people go the children of israel went
every man unto his inheritance to possess the land
and the people served the lord all the days of joshua and all the
days of the elders that outlived joshua who had seen all the great
works of the lord that he did for israel
and joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being an
hundred and ten years old
and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
timnathheres in the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hill
gaash
and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers
and there arose another generation after them which knew not the
lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and
served baalim  and they forsook the lord god of their fathers
which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods
of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed
themselves unto them and provoked the lord to anger
and they forsook the lord and served baal and ashtaroth
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he
delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them and he
sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they
could not any longer stand before their enemies
whithersoever they went out the hand of the lord was against
them for evil as the lord had said and as the lord had sworn unto
them and they were greatly distressed
nevertheless the lord raised up judges which delivered them out
of the hand of those that spoiled them
and yet they would not hearken unto their judges but they went a
whoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turned
quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the
commandments of the lord but they did not so
and when the lord raised them up judges then the lord was with
the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the
days of the judge for it repented the lord because of their groanings
by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them
and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned
and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other
gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from
their own doings nor from their stubborn way
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he said
because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which i
commanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voice  i
also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations
which joshua left when he died  that through them i may prove
israel whether they will keep the way of the lord to walk therein as
their fathers did keep it or not
therefore the lord left those nations without driving them out
hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of joshua
now these are the nations which the lord left to prove israel by
them even as many of israel as had not known all the wars of canaan
only that the generations of the children of israel might know to
teach them war at the least such as before knew nothing thereof
namely five lords of the philistines and all the canaanites and the
sidonians and the hivites that dwelt in mount lebanon from mount
baalhermon unto the entering in of hamath
and they were to prove israel by them to know whether they would
hearken unto the commandments of the lord which he commanded their
fathers by the hand of moses
and the children of israel dwelt among the canaanites hittites
and amorites and perizzites and hivites and jebusites  and they
took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to
their sons and served their gods
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and
forgat the lord their god and served baalim and the groves
therefore the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he
sold them into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia and
the children of israel served chushanrishathaim eight years
and when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lord
raised up a deliverer to the children of israel who delivered them
even othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother
and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he judged israel
and went out to war and the lord delivered chushanrishathaim king of
mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed against
chushanrishathaim
and the land had rest forty years and othniel the son of kenaz
died
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the
lord and the lord strengthened eglon the king of moab against israel
because they had done evil in the sight of the lord
and he gathered unto him the children of ammon and amalek and
went and smote israel and possessed the city of palm trees
so the children of israel served eglon the king of moab eighteen
years
but when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lord
raised them up a deliverer ehud the son of gera a benjamite a man
lefthanded and by him the children of israel sent a present unto
eglon the king of moab
but ehud made him a dagger which had two edges of a cubit
length and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh
and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab and eglon was
a very fat man
and when he had made an end to offer the present he sent away
the people that bare the present
but he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
gilgal and said i have a secret errand unto thee o king who said
keep silence and all that stood by him went out from him
and ehud came unto him and he was sitting in a summer parlour
which he had for himself alone and ehud said i have a message from
god unto thee
and he arose out of his seat
and ehud put forth his left hand and took the dagger from his
right thigh and thrust it into his belly  and the haft also went
in after the blade and the fat closed upon the blade so that he
could not draw the dagger out of his belly and the dirt came out
then ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the
parlour upon him and locked them
when he was gone out his servants came and when they saw that
behold the doors of the parlour were locked they said surely he
covereth his feet in his summer chamber
and they tarried till they were ashamed and behold he opened
not the doors of the parlour therefore they took a key and opened
them and behold their lord was fallen down dead on the earth
and ehud escaped while they tarried and passed beyond the
quarries and escaped unto seirath
and it came to pass when he was come that he blew a trumpet in
the mountain of ephraim and the children of israel went down with him
from the mount and he before them
and he said unto them follow after me for the lord hath
delivered your enemies the moabites into your hand and they went down
after him and took the fords of jordan toward moab and suffered not
a man to pass over
and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men all
lusty and all men of valour and there escaped not a man
so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel and the
land had rest fourscore years
and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of the
philistines six hundred men with an ox goad and he also delivered
israel
and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the
lord when ehud was dead
and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan that
reigned in hazor the captain of whose host was sisera which dwelt in
harosheth of the gentiles
and the children of israel cried unto the lord for he had nine
hundred chariots of iron and twenty years he mightily oppressed the
children of israel
and deborah a prophetess the wife of lapidoth she judged israel
at that time
and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and
bethel in mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for
judgment
and she sent and called barak the son of abinoam out of
kedeshnaphtali and said unto him hath not the lord god of israel
commanded saying go and draw toward mount tabor and take with thee
ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of
zebulun   and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera
the captain of jabins army with his chariots and his multitude and
i will deliver him into thine hand
and barak said unto her if thou wilt go with me then i will go
but if thou wilt not go with me then i will not go
and she said i will surely go with thee notwithstanding the
journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour for the lord
shall sell sisera into the hand of a woman and deborah arose and
went with barak to kedesh
and barak called zebulun and naphtali to kedesh and he went up
with ten thousand men at his feet and deborah went up with him
now heber the kenite which was of the children of hobab the
father in law of moses had severed himself from the kenites and
pitched his tent unto the plain of zaanaim which is by kedesh
and they shewed sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone up
to mount tabor
and sisera gathered together all his chariots even nine hundred
chariots of iron and all the people that were with him from
harosheth of the gentiles unto the river of kishon
and deborah said unto barak up for this is the day in which the
lord hath delivered sisera into thine hand is not the lord gone out
before thee so barak went down from mount tabor and ten thousand men
after him
and the lord discomfited sisera and all his chariots and all
his host with the edge of the sword before barak so that sisera
lighted down off his chariot and fled away on his feet
but barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto
harosheth of the gentiles and all the host of sisera fell upon the
edge of the sword and there was not a man left
howbeit sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of jael the wife
of heber the kenite for there was peace between jabin the king of
hazor and the house of heber the kenite
and jael went out to meet sisera and said unto him turn in my
lord turn in to me fear not and when he had turned in unto her into
the tent she covered him with a mantle
and he said unto her give me i pray thee a little water to
drink for i am thirsty and she opened a bottle of milk and gave him
drink and covered him
again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it
shall be when any man doth come and enquire of thee and say is
there any man here that thou shalt say no
then jael hebers wife took a nail of the tent and took an
hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail into
his temples and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleep
and weary so he died
and behold as barak pursued sisera jael came out to meet him
and said unto him come and i will shew thee the man whom thou
seekest and when he came into her tent behold sisera lay dead and
the nail was in his temples
so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before the
children of israel
and the hand of the children of israel prospered and prevailed
against jabin the king of canaan until they had destroyed jabin king
of canaan
then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day
saying  praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel when the
people willingly offered themselves
hear o ye kings give ear o ye princes i even i will sing
unto the lord i will sing praise to the lord god of israel
lord when thou wentest out of seir when thou marchedst out of
the field of edom the earth trembled and the heavens dropped the
clouds also dropped water
the mountains melted from before the lord even that sinai from
before the lord god of israel
in the days of shamgar the son of anath in the days of jael the
highways were unoccupied and the travellers walked through byways
the inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in israel
until that i deborah arose that i arose a mother in israel
they chose new gods then was war in the gates was there a shield
or spear seen among forty thousand in israel   my heart is toward
the governors of israel that offered themselves willingly among the
people bless ye the lord
speak ye that ride on white asses ye that sit in judgment and
walk by the way
they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places
of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the
lord even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages
in israel then shall the people of the lord go down to the gates
awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song arise barak
and lead thy captivity captive thou son of abinoam
then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
among the people the lord made me have dominion over the mighty
out of ephraim was there a root of them against amalek after
thee benjamin among thy people out of machir came down governors
and out of zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer
and the princes of issachar were with deborah even issachar and
also barak he was sent on foot into the valley for the divisions of
reuben there were great thoughts of heart
why abodest thou among the sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of
the flocks for the divisions of reuben there were great searchings of
heart
gilead abode beyond jordan and why did dan remain in ships
asher continued on the sea shore and abode in his breaches
zebulun and naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
unto the death in the high places of the field
the kings came and fought then fought the kings of canaan in
taanach by the waters of megiddo they took no gain of money
they fought from heaven the stars in their courses fought
against sisera
the river of kishon swept them away that ancient river the
river kishon o my soul thou hast trodden down strength
then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings
the pransings of their mighty ones
curse ye meroz said the angel of the lord curse ye bitterly the
inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of the lord to
the help of the lord against the mighty
blessed above women shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be
blessed shall she be above women in the tent
he asked water and she gave him milk she brought forth butter
in a lordly dish
she put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmens
hammer and with the hammer she smote sisera she smote off his head
when she had pierced and stricken through his temples
at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed
he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead
the mother of sisera looked out at a window and cried through
the lattice why is his chariot so long in coming why tarry the
wheels of his chariots   her wise ladies answered her yea she
returned answer to herself  have they not sped have they not
divided the prey to every man a damsel or two to sisera a prey of
divers colours a prey of divers colours of needlework of divers
colours of needlework on both sides meet for the necks of them that
take the spoil   so let all thine enemies perish o lord but let
them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might and
the land had rest forty years
and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and
the lord delivered them into the hand of midian seven years
and the hand of midian prevailed against israel and because of
the midianites the children of israel made them the dens which are in
the mountains and caves and strong holds
and so it was when israel had sown that the midianites came up
and the amalekites and the children of the east even they came up
against them  and they encamped against them and destroyed the
increase of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no
sustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass
for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came
as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were
without number and they entered into the land to destroy it
and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and
the children of israel cried unto the lord
and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto the
lord because of the midianites  that the lord sent a prophet unto
the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god
of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of
the house of bondage  and i delivered you out of the hand of the
egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave
them out from before you and gave you their land  and i said
unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites
in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice
and there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which
was in ophrah that pertained unto joash the abiezrite and his son
gideon threshed wheat by the winepress to hide it from the
midianites
and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him
the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valour
and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us why
then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our
fathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt
but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of
the midianites
and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and
thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i
sent thee   and he said unto him oh my lord wherewith shall i
save israel  behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the
least in my fathers house
and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou
shalt smite the midianites as one man
and he said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight
then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me
depart not hence i pray thee until i come unto thee and bring
forth my present and set it before thee and he said i will tarry
until thou come again
and gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of
an ephah of flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth
in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it
and the angel of god said unto him take the flesh and the
unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth
and he did so
then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that
was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and
there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the
unleavened cakes then the angel of the lord departed out of his
sight
and when gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lord
gideon said alas o lord god for because i have seen an angel of the
lord face to face
and the lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou
shalt not die
then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and called it
jehovahshalom unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrites
and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him
take thy fathers young bullock even the second bullock of seven
years old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath and
cut down the grove that is by it  and build an altar unto the
lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take
the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the
grove which thou shalt cut down
then gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the lord had
said unto him and so it was because he feared his fathers
household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day
that he did it by night
and when the men of the city arose early in the morning behold
the altar of baal was cast down and the grove was cut down that was
by it and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was
built
and they said one to another who hath done this thing and when
they enquired and asked they said gideon the son of joash hath done
this thing
then the men of the city said unto joash bring out thy son that
he may die because he hath cast down the altar of baal and because
he hath cut down the grove that was by it
and joash said unto all that stood against him will ye plead for
baal will ye save him he that will plead for him let him be put to
death whilst it is yet morning if he be a god let him plead for
himself because one hath cast down his altar
therefore on that day he called him jerubbaal saying let baal
plead against him because he hath thrown down his altar
then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of
the east were gathered together and went over and pitched in the
valley of jezreel
but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew a
trumpet and abiezer was gathered after him
and he sent messengers throughout all manasseh who also was
gathered after him and he sent messengers unto asher and unto
zebulun and unto naphtali and they came up to meet them
and gideon said unto god if thou wilt save israel by mine hand
as thou hast said  behold i will put a fleece of wool in the
floor and if the dew be on the fleece only and it be dry upon all
the earth beside then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine
hand as thou hast said
and it was so for he rose up early on the morrow and thrust the
fleece together and wringed the dew out of the fleece a bowl full of
water
and gideon said unto god let not thine anger be hot against me
and i will speak but this once let me prove i pray thee but this
once with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon
all the ground let there be dew
and god did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only
and there was dew on all the ground
then jerubbaal who is gideon and all the people that were with
him rose up early and pitched beside the well of harod so that the
host of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of
moreh in the valley
and the lord said unto gideon the people that are with thee are
too many for me to give the midianites into their hands lest israel
vaunt themselves against me saying mine own hand hath saved me
now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying
whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from
mount gilead and there returned of the people twenty and two
thousand and there remained ten thousand
and the lord said unto gideon the people are yet too many bring
them down unto the water and i will try them for thee there and it
shall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the
same shall go with thee and of whomsoever i say unto thee this shall
not go with thee the same shall not go
so he brought down the people unto the water and the lord said
unto gideon every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a
dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one that
boweth down upon his knees to drink
and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their
mouth were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bowed
down upon their knees to drink water
and the lord said unto gideon by the three hundred men that
lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand
and let all the other people go every man unto his place
so the people took victuals in their hand and their trumpets and
he sent all the rest of israel every man unto his tent and retained
those three hundred men and the host of midian was beneath him in the
valley
and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him
arise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine
hand
but if thou fear to go down go thou with phurah thy servant down
to the host  and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward
shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host then went
he down with phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that
were in the host
and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the
east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and
their camels were without number as the sand by the sea side for
multitude
and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a
dream unto his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and lo a
cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian and came unto a
tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay
along
and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the
sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for into his hand
hath god delivered midian and all the host
and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and
the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into the
host of israel and said arise for the lord hath delivered into your
hand the host of midian
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies and he
put a trumpet in every mans hand with empty pitchers and lamps
within the pitchers
and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold
when i come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as i do so
shall ye do
when i blow with a trumpet i and all that are with me then blow
ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say the sword
of the lord and of gideon
so gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the
outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch and they had
but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake the
pitchers that were in their hands
and the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the
pitchers and held the lamps in their left hands and the trumpets in
their right hands to blow withal and they cried the sword of the
lord and of gideon
and they stood every man in his place round about the camp and
all the host ran and cried and fled
and the three hundred blew the trumpets and the lord set every
mans sword against his fellow even throughout all the host and the
host fled to bethshittah in zererath and to the border of
abelmeholah unto tabbath
and the men of israel gathered themselves together out of
naphtali and out of asher and out of all manasseh and pursued after
the midianites
and gideon sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim saying
come down against the midianites and take before them the waters unto
bethbarah and jordan then all the men of ephraim gathered themselves
together and took the waters unto bethbarah and jordan
and they took two princes of the midianites oreb and zeeb and
they slew oreb upon the rock oreb and zeeb they slew at the winepress
of zeeb and pursued midian and brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to
gideon on the other side jordan
and the men of ephraim said unto him why hast thou served us
thus that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the
midianites  and they did chide with him sharply
and he said unto them what have i done now in comparison of you
is not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage
of abiezer   god hath delivered into your hands the princes of
midian oreb and zeeb and what was i able to do in comparison of you
then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that
and gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the three
hundred men that were with him faint yet pursuing them
and he said unto the men of succoth give i pray you loaves of
bread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and i am
pursuing after zebah and zalmunna kings of midian
and the princes of succoth said are the hands of zebah and
zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine army
and gideon said therefore when the lord hath delivered zebah and
zalmunna into mine hand then i will tear your flesh with the thorns
of the wilderness and with briers
and he went up thence to penuel and spake unto them likewise and
the men of penuel answered him as the men of succoth had answered him
and he spake also unto the men of penuel saying when i come
again in peace i will break down this tower
now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their hosts with them
about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of the
children of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand
men that drew sword
and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the
east of nobah and jogbehah and smote the host for the host was
secure
and when zebah and zalmunna fled he pursued after them and took
the two kings of midian zebah and zalmunna and discomfited all the
host
and gideon the son of joash returned from battle before the sun
was up  and caught a young man of the men of succoth and
enquired of him and he described unto him the princes of succoth and
the elders thereof even threescore and seventeen men
and he came unto the men of succoth and said behold zebah and
zalmunna with whom ye did upbraid me saying are the hands of zebah
and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thy men
that are weary   and he took the elders of the city and thorns
of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of
succoth
and he beat down the tower of penuel and slew the men of the
city
then said he unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of men were
they whom ye slew at tabor and they answered as thou art so were
they each one resembled the children of a king
and he said they were my brethren even the sons of my mother
as the lord liveth if ye had saved them alive i would not slay you
and he said unto jether his firstborn up and slay them but the
youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth
then zebah and zalmunna said rise thou and fall upon us for as
the man is so is his strength and gideon arose and slew zebah and
zalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels
necks
then the men of israel said unto gideon rule thou over us both
thou and thy son and thy sons son also for thou hast delivered us
from the hand of midian
and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neither
shall my son rule over you the lord shall rule over you
and gideon said unto them i would desire a request of you that
ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey for they had
golden earrings because they were ishmaelites   and they
answered we will willingly give them and they spread a garment and
did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey
and the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and
collars and purple raiment that was on the kings of midian and
beside the chains that were about their camels necks
and gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city even in
ophrah and all israel went thither a whoring after it which thing
became a snare unto gideon and to his house
thus was midian subdued before the children of israel so that
they lifted up their heads no more and the country was in quietness
forty years in the days of gideon
and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house
and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for
he had many wives
and his concubine that was in shechem she also bare him a son
whose name he called abimelech
and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age and was
buried in the sepulchre of joash his father in ophrah of the
abiezrites
and it came to pass as soon as gideon was dead that the
children of israel turned again and went a whoring after baalim and
made baalberith their god
and the children of israel remembered not the lord their god who
had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every
side  neither shewed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal
namely gideon according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto
israel
and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his
mothers brethren and communed with them and with all the family of
the house of his mothers father saying  speak i pray you in
the ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you either
that all the sons of jerubbaal which are threescore and ten persons
reign over you or that one reign over you remember also that i am
your bone and your flesh
and his mothers brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men
of shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow
abimelech for they said he is our brother
and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the
house of baalberith wherewith abimelech hired vain and light persons
which followed him
and he went unto his fathers house at ophrah and slew his
brethren the sons of jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons upon
one stone notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal
was left for he hid himself
and all the men of shechem gathered together and all the house of
millo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillar
that was in shechem
and when they told it to jotham he went and stood in the top of
mount gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them
hearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you
the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them and
they said unto the olive tree reign thou over us
but the olive tree said unto them should i leave my fatness
wherewith by me they honour god and man and go to be promoted over
the trees   and the trees said to the fig tree come thou and
reign over us
but the fig tree said unto them should i forsake my sweetness
and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees   then
said the trees unto the vine come thou and reign over us
and the vine said unto them should i leave my wine which
cheereth god and man and go to be promoted over the trees   then
said all the trees unto the bramble come thou and reign over us
and the bramble said unto the trees if in truth ye anoint me
king over you then come and put your trust in my shadow and if not
let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of lebanon
now therefore if ye have done truly and sincerely in that ye
have made abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and
his house and have done unto him according to the deserving of his
hands  for my father fought for you and adventured his life
far and delivered you out of the hand of midian  and ye are
risen up against my fathers house this day and have slain his sons
threescore and ten persons upon one stone and have made abimelech
the son of his maidservant king over the men of shechem because he
is your brother  if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with
jerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice ye in abimelech
and let him also rejoice in you  but if not let fire come out
from abimelech and devour the men of shechem and the house of millo
and let fire come out from the men of shechem and from the house of
millo and devour abimelech
and jotham ran away and fled and went to beer and dwelt there
for fear of abimelech his brother
when abimelech had reigned three years over israel  then god
sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem and the
men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech  that the
cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of jerubbaal might come
and their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother which slew them
and upon the men of shechem which aided him in the killing of his
brethren
and the men of shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of
the mountains and they robbed all that came along that way by them
and it was told abimelech
and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren and went over to
shechem and the men of shechem put their confidence in him
and they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards
and trode the grapes and made merry and went into the house of their
god and did eat and drink and cursed abimelech
and gaal the son of ebed said who is abimelech and who is
shechem that we should serve him is not he the son of jerubbaal and
zebul his officer serve the men of hamor the father of shechem for
why should we serve him   and would to god this people were under
my hand then would i remove abimelech and he said to abimelech
increase thine army and come out
and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal the
son of ebed his anger was kindled
and he sent messengers unto abimelech privily saying behold
gaal the son of ebed and his brethren be come to shechem and behold
they fortify the city against thee
now therefore up by night thou and the people that is with thee
and lie in wait in the field  and it shall be that in the
morning as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early and set upon
the city and behold when he and the people that is with him come
out against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find
occasion
and abimelech rose up and all the people that were with him by
night and they laid wait against shechem in four companies
and gaal the son of ebed went out and stood in the entering of
the gate of the city and abimelech rose up and the people that were
with him from lying in wait
and when gaal saw the people he said to zebul behold there
come people down from the top of the mountains and zebul said unto
him thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men
and gaal spake again and said see there come people down by the
middle of the land and another company come along by the plain of
meonenim
then said zebul unto him where is now thy mouth wherewith thou
saidst who is abimelech that we should serve him is not this the
people that thou hast despised go out i pray now and fight with
them
and gaal went out before the men of shechem and fought with
abimelech
and abimelech chased him and he fled before him and many were
overthrown and wounded even unto the entering of the gate
and abimelech dwelt at arumah and zebul thrust out gaal and his
brethren that they should not dwell in shechem
and it came to pass on the morrow that the people went out into
the field and they told abimelech
and he took the people and divided them into three companies
and laid wait in the field and looked and behold the people were
come forth out of the city and he rose up against them and smote
them
and abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward
and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and the two other
companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields and slew
them
and abimelech fought against the city all that day and he took
the city and slew the people that was therein and beat down the
city and sowed it with salt
and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard that they
entered into an hold of the house of the god berith
and it was told abimelech that all the men of the tower of
shechem were gathered together
and abimelech gat him up to mount zalmon he and all the people
that were with him and abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut
down a bough from the trees and took it and laid it on his shoulder
and said unto the people that were with him what ye have seen me do
make haste and do as i have done
and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and
followed abimelech and put them to the hold and set the hold on fire
upon them so that all the men of the tower of shechem died also
about a thousand men and women
then went abimelech to thebez and encamped against thebez and
took it
but there was a strong tower within the city and thither fled
all the men and women and all they of the city and shut it to them
and gat them up to the top of the tower
and abimelech came unto the tower and fought against it and
went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire
and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon abimelechs
head and all to brake his skull
then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer and
said unto him draw thy sword and slay me that men say not of me a
women slew him and his young man thrust him through and he died
and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead they
departed every man unto his place
thus god rendered the wickedness of abimelech which he did unto
his father in slaying his seventy brethren  and all the evil of
the men of shechem did god render upon their heads and upon them came
the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal
and after abimelech there arose to defend israel tola the son of
puah the son of dodo a man of issachar and he dwelt in shamir in
mount ephraim
and he judged israel twenty and three years and died and was
buried in shamir
and after him arose jair a gileadite and judged israel twenty
and two years
and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts and they
had thirty cities which are called havothjair unto this day which
are in the land of gilead
and jair died and was buried in camon
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the
lord and served baalim and ashtaroth and the gods of syria and the
gods of zidon and the gods of moab and the gods of the children of
ammon and the gods of the philistines and forsook the lord and
served not him
and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold
them into the hands of the philistines and into the hands of the
children of ammon
and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of israel
eighteen years all the children of israel that were on the other side
jordan in the land of the amorites which is in gilead
moreover the children of ammon passed over jordan to fight also
against judah and against benjamin and against the house of ephraim
so that israel was sore distressed
and the children of israel cried unto the lord saying we have
sinned against thee both because we have forsaken our god and also
served baalim
and the lord said unto the children of israel did not i deliver
you from the egyptians and from the amorites from the children of
ammon and from the philistines   the zidonians also and the
amalekites and the maonites did oppress you and ye cried to me and
i delivered you out of their hand
yet ye have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore i will
deliver you no more
go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen let them deliver
you in the time of your tribulation
and the children of israel said unto the lord we have sinned
do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee deliver us only we
pray thee this day
and they put away the strange gods from among them and served
the lord and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel
then the children of ammon were gathered together and encamped
in gilead and the children of israel assembled themselves together
and encamped in mizpeh
and the people and princes of gilead said one to another what
man is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon he
shall be head over all the inhabitants of gilead
now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valour and he was
the son of an harlot and gilead begat jephthah
and gileads wife bare him sons and his wifes sons grew up and
they thrust out jephthah and said unto him thou shalt not inherit in
our fathers house for thou art the son of a strange woman
then jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of
tob and there were gathered vain men to jephthah and went out with
him
and it came to pass in process of time that the children of
ammon made war against israel
and it was so that when the children of ammon made war against
israel the elders of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of
tob  and they said unto jephthah come and be our captain that
we may fight with the children of ammon
and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead did not ye hate me
and expel me out of my fathers house and why are ye come unto me now
when ye are in distress   and the elders of gilead said unto
jephthah therefore we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go
with us and fight against the children of ammon and be our head over
all the inhabitants of gilead
and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead if ye bring me home
again to fight against the children of ammon and the lord deliver
them before me shall i be your head   and the elders of gilead
said unto jephthah the lord be witness between us if we do not so
according to thy words
then jephthah went with the elders of gilead and the people
made him head and captain over them and jephthah uttered all his
words before the lord in mizpeh
and jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of
ammon saying what hast thou to do with me that thou art come
against me to fight in my land   and the king of the children of
ammon answered unto the messengers of jephthah because israel took
away my land when they came up out of egypt from arnon even unto
jabbok and unto jordan now therefore restore those lands again
peaceably
and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children
of ammon  and said unto him thus saith jephthah israel took
not away the land of moab nor the land of the children of ammon
but when israel came up from egypt and walked through the
wilderness unto the red sea and came to kadesh  then israel
sent messengers unto the king of edom saying let me i pray thee
pass through thy land but the king of edom would not hearken thereto
and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab but he would not
consent and israel abode in kadesh
then they went along through the wilderness and compassed the
land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the
land of moab and pitched on the other side of arnon but came not
within the border of moab for arnon was the border of moab
and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites the
king of heshbon and israel said unto him let us pass we pray thee
through thy land into my place
but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his coast but
sihon gathered all his people together and pitched in jahaz and
fought against israel
and the lord god of israel delivered sihon and all his people
into the hand of israel and they smote them so israel possessed all
the land of the amorites the inhabitants of that country
and they possessed all the coasts of the amorites from arnon
even unto jabbok and from the wilderness even unto jordan
so now the lord god of israel hath dispossessed the amorites
from before his people israel and shouldest thou possess it
wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to
possess so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from before
us them will we possess
and now art thou any thing better than balak the son of zippor
king of moab did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fight
against them  while israel dwelt in heshbon and her towns and
in aroer and her towns and in all the cities that be along by the
coasts of arnon three hundred years why therefore did ye not recover
them within that time   wherefore i have not sinned against
thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me the lord the judge be
judge this day between the children of israel and the children of
ammon
howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the
words of jephthah which he sent him
then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he passed
over gilead and manasseh and passed over mizpeh of gilead and from
mizpeh of gilead he passed over unto the children of ammon
and jephthah vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou shalt
without fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands  then
it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to
meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon shall
surely be the lords and i will offer it up for a burnt offering
so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight
against them and the lord delivered them into his hands
and he smote them from aroer even till thou come to minnith
even twenty cities and unto the plain of the vineyards with a very
great slaughter thus the children of ammon were subdued before the
children of israel
and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his house and behold his
daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she
was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter
and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes
and said alas my daughter thou hast brought me very low and thou
art one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto the
lord and i cannot go back
and she said unto him my father if thou hast opened thy mouth
unto the lord do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of
thy mouth forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeance for thee of
thine enemies even of the children of ammon
and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let
me alone two months that i may go up and down upon the mountains and
bewail my virginity i and my fellows
and he said go and he sent her away for two months and she
went with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the
mountains
and it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned
unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he had
vowed and she knew no man and it was a custom in israel  that
the daughters of israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah
the gileadite four days in a year
and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and went
northward and said unto jephthah wherefore passedst thou over to
fight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go with
thee we will burn thine house upon thee with fire
and jephthah said unto them i and my people were at great strife
with the children of ammon and when i called you ye delivered me not
out of their hands
and when i saw that ye delivered me not i put my life in my
hands and passed over against the children of ammon and the lord
delivered them into my hand wherefore then are ye come up unto me
this day to fight against me   then jephthah gathered together
all the men of gilead and fought with ephraim and the men of gilead
smote ephraim because they said ye gileadites are fugitives of
ephraim among the ephraimites and among the manassites
and the gileadites took the passages of jordan before the
ephraimites and it was so that when those ephraimites which were
escaped said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him
art thou an ephraimite if he said nay  then said they unto him
say now shibboleth and he said sibboleth for he could not frame to
pronounce it right then they took him and slew him at the passages
of jordan and there fell at that time of the ephraimites forty and
two thousand
and jephthah judged israel six years then died jephthah the
gileadite and was buried in one of the cities of gilead
and after him ibzan of bethlehem judged israel
and he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent
abroad and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons and he
judged israel seven years
then died ibzan and was buried at bethlehem
and after him elon a zebulonite judged israel and he judged
israel ten years
and elon the zebulonite died and was buried in aijalon in the
country of zebulun
and after him abdon the son of hillel a pirathonite judged
israel
and he had forty sons and thirty nephews that rode on
threescore and ten ass colts and he judged israel eight years
and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite died and was buried
in pirathon in the land of ephraim in the mount of the amalekites
and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the
lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistines
forty years
and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the
danites whose name was manoah and his wife was barren and bare not
and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman and said unto
her behold now thou art barren and bearest not but thou shalt
conceive and bear a son
now therefore beware i pray thee and drink not wine nor strong
drink and eat not any unclean thing  for lo thou shalt
conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the
child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb and he shall begin
to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines
then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god
came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel
of god very terrible but i asked him not whence he was neither told
he me his name  but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive
and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat
any unclean thing for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the
womb to the day of his death
then manoah intreated the lord and said o my lord let the man
of god which thou didst send come again unto us and teach us what we
shall do unto the child that shall be born
and god hearkened to the voice of manoah and the angel of god
came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but manoah her
husband was not with her
and the woman made haste and ran and shewed her husband and
said unto him behold the man hath appeared unto me that came unto
me the other day
and manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man
and said unto him art thou the man that spakest unto the woman and
he said i am
and manoah said now let thy words come to pass how shall we
order the child and how shall we do unto him   and the angel of
the lord said unto manoah of all that i said unto the woman let her
beware
she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine neither
let her drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing all
that i commanded her let her observe
and manoah said unto the angel of the lord i pray thee let us
detain thee until we shall have made ready a kid for thee
and the angel of the lord said unto manoah though thou detain
me i will not eat of thy bread and if thou wilt offer a burnt
offering thou must offer it unto the lord for manoah knew not that
he was an angel of the lord
and manoah said unto the angel of the lord what is thy name
that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour   and
the angel of the lord said unto him why askest thou thus after my
name seeing it is secret   so manoah took a kid with a meat
offering and offered it upon a rock unto the lord and the angel did
wonderously and manoah and his wife looked on
for it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven from
off the altar that the angel of the lord ascended in the flame of the
altar and manoah and his wife looked on it and fell on their faces
to the ground
but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoah and to
his wife then manoah knew that he was an angel of the lord
and manoah said unto his wife we shall surely die because we
have seen god
but his wife said unto him if the lord were pleased to kill us
he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our
hands neither would he have shewed us all these things nor would as
at this time have told us such things as these
and the woman bare a son and called his name samson and the
child grew and the lord blessed him
and the spirit of the lord began to move him at times in the
camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol
and samson went down to timnath and saw a woman in timnath of
the daughters of the philistines
and he came up and told his father and his mother and said i
have seen a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines now
therefore get her for me to wife
then his father and his mother said unto him is there never a
woman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all my people
that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistines and
samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleaseth me well
but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the lord
that he sought an occasion against the philistines for at that time
the philistines had dominion over israel
then went samson down and his father and his mother to timnath
and came to the vineyards of timnath and behold a young lion roared
against him
and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and he rent
him as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand but
he told not his father or his mother what he had done
and he went down and talked with the woman and she pleased
samson well
and after a time he returned to take her and he turned aside to
see the carcase of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees
and honey in the carcase of the lion
and he took thereof in his hands and went on eating and came to
his father and mother and he gave them and they did eat but he told
not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion
so his father went down unto the woman and samson made there a
feast for so used the young men to do
and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought thirty
companions to be with him
and samson said unto them i will now put forth a riddle unto
you if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the
feast and find it out then i will give you thirty sheets and thirty
change of garments  but if ye cannot declare it me then shall
ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments and they said
unto him put forth thy riddle that we may hear it
and he said unto them out of the eater came forth meat and out
of the strong came forth sweetness and they could not in three days
expound the riddle
and it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto
samsons wife entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the
riddle lest we burn thee and thy fathers house with fire have ye
called us to take that we have is it not so   and samsons wife
wept before him and said thou dost but hate me and lovest me not
thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and hast
not told it me and he said unto her behold i have not told it my
father nor my mother and shall i tell it thee   and she wept
before him the seven days while their feast lasted and it came to
pass on the seventh day that he told her because she lay sore upon
him and she told the riddle to the children of her people
and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before
the sun went down what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger
than a lion  and he said unto them if ye had not plowed with my
heifer ye had not found out my riddle
and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he went down to
ashkelon and slew thirty men of them and took their spoil and gave
change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle and his anger
was kindled and he went up to his fathers house
but samsons wife was given to his companion whom he had used
as his friend
but it came to pass within a while after in the time of wheat
harvest that samson visited his wife with a kid and he said i will
go in to my wife into the chamber but her father would not suffer him
to go in
and her father said i verily thought that thou hadst utterly
hated her therefore i gave her to thy companion is not her younger
sister fairer than she take her i pray thee instead of her
and samson said concerning them now shall i be more blameless
than the philistines though i do them a displeasure
and samson went and caught three hundred foxes and took
firebrands and turned tail to tail and put a firebrand in the midst
between two tails
and when he had set the brands on fire he let them go into the
standing corn of the philistines and burnt up both the shocks and
also the standing corn with the vineyards and olives
then the philistines said who hath done this and they answered
samson the son in law of the timnite because he had taken his wife
and given her to his companion and the philistines came up and burnt
her and her father with fire
and samson said unto them though ye have done this yet will i
be avenged of you and after that i will cease
and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and he
went down and dwelt in the top of the rock etam
then the philistines went up and pitched in judah and spread
themselves in lehi
and the men of judah said why are ye come up against us and
they answered to bind samson are we come up to do to him as he hath
done to us
then three thousand men of judah went to the top of the rock
etam and said to samson knowest thou not that the philistines are
rulers over us what is this that thou hast done unto us and he said
unto them as they did unto me so have i done unto them
and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee that we
may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines and samson said
unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves
and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fast
and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee
and they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the
rock
and when he came unto lehi the philistines shouted against him
and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and the cords that
were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire and his
bands loosed from off his hands
and he found a new jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand
and took it and slew a thousand men therewith
and samson said with the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps
with the jaw of an ass have i slain a thousand men
and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that
he cast away the jawbone out of his hand and called that place
ramathlehi
and he was sore athirst and called on the lord and said thou
hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant and
now shall i die for thirst and fall into the hand of the
uncircumcised   but god clave an hollow place that was in the
jaw and there came water thereout and when he had drunk his spirit
came again and he revived wherefore he called the name thereof
enhakkore which is in lehi unto this day
and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twenty
years
then went samson to gaza and saw there an harlot and went in
unto her
and it was told the gazites saying samson is come hither and
they compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of
the city and were quiet all the night saying in the morning when
it is day we shall kill him
and samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the
doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with
them bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them
up to the top of an hill that is before hebron
and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the
valley of sorek whose name was delilah
and the lords of the philistines came up unto her and said unto
her entice him and see wherein his great strength lieth and by what
means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him
and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver
and delilah said to samson tell me i pray thee wherein thy
great strength lieth and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict
thee
and samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green withs
that were never dried then shall i be weak and be as another man
then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven green
withs which had not been dried and she bound him with them
now there were men lying in wait abiding with her in the
chamber
and she said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and he
brake the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the
fire so his strength was not known
and delilah said unto samson behold thou hast mocked me and
told me lies now tell me i pray thee wherewith thou mightest be
bound
and he said unto her if they bind me fast with new ropes that
never were occupied then shall i be weak and be as another man
delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him therewith and
said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and there were
liers in wait abiding in the chamber and he brake them from off his
arms like a thread
and delilah said unto samson hitherto thou hast mocked me and
told me lies tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound and he said
unto her if thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web
and she fastened it with the pin and said unto him the
philistines be upon thee samson and he awaked out of his sleep and
went away with the pin of the beam and with the web
and she said unto him how canst thou say i love thee when
thine heart is not with me thou hast mocked me these three times and
hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth
and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words
and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death  that he
told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor
upon mine head for i have been a nazarite unto god from my mothers
womb if i be shaven then my strength will go from me and i shall
become weak and be like any other man
and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she
sent and called for the lords of the philistines saying come up this
once for he hath shewed me all his heart then the lords of the
philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand
and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man
and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she
began to afflict him and his strength went from him
and she said the philistines be upon thee samson and he awoke
out of his sleep and said i will go out as at other times before
and shake myself and he wist not that the lord was departed from him
but the philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought
him down to gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did
grind in the prison house
howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
shaven
then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for to
offer a great sacrifice unto dagon their god and to rejoice for they
said our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand
and when the people saw him they praised their god for they
said our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the
destroyer of our country which slew many of us
and it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they
said call for samson that he may make us sport and they called for
samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set
him between the pillars
and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer
me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that i
may lean upon them
now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of
the philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three
thousand men and women that beheld while samson made sport
and samson called unto the lord and said o lord god remember
me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once o
god that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes
and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
house stood and on which it was borne up of the one with his right
hand and of the other with his left
and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bowed
himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and
upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at
his death were more than they which he slew in his life
then his brethren and all the house of his father came down and
took him and brought him up and buried him between zorah and eshtaol
in the buryingplace of manoah his father and he judged israel twenty
years
and there was a man of mount ephraim whose name was micah
and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver
that were taken from thee about which thou cursedst and spakest of
also in mine ears behold the silver is with me i took it and his
mother said blessed be thou of the lord my son
and when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to
his mother his mother said i had wholly dedicated the silver unto
the lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten
image now therefore i will restore it unto thee
yet he restored the money unto his mother and his mother took
two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made
thereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house
of micah
and the man micah had an house of gods and made an ephod and
teraphim and consecrated one of his sons who became his priest
in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that
which was right in his own eyes
and there was a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family of
judah who was a levite and he sojourned there
and the man departed out of the city from bethlehemjudah to
sojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount ephraim to
the house of micah as he journeyed
and micah said unto him whence comest thou and he said unto
him i am a levite of bethlehemjudah and i go to sojourn where i may
find a place
and micah said unto him dwell with me and be unto me a father
and a priest and i will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year
and a suit of apparel and thy victuals so the levite went in
and the levite was content to dwell with the man and the young
man was unto him as one of his sons
and micah consecrated the levite and the young man became his
priest and was in the house of micah
then said micah now know i that the lord will do me good
seeing i have a levite to my priest
in those days there was no king in israel and in those days the
tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in for unto
that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the
tribes of israel
and the children of dan sent of their family five men from their
coasts men of valour from zorah and from eshtaol to spy out the
land and to search it and they said unto them go search the land
who when they came to mount ephraim to the house of micah they
lodged there
when they were by the house of micah they knew the voice of the
young man the levite and they turned in thither and said unto him
who brought thee hither and what makest thou in this place and what
hast thou here   and he said unto them thus and thus dealeth
micah with me and hath hired me and i am his priest
and they said unto him ask counsel we pray thee of god that
we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous
and the priest said unto them go in peace before the lord is
your way wherein ye go
then the five men departed and came to laish and saw the people
that were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of the
zidonians quiet and secure and there was no magistrate in the land
that might put them to shame in any thing and they were far from the
zidonians and had no business with any man
and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol and their
brethren said unto them what say ye   and they said arise that
we may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it
is very good and are ye still be not slothful to go and to enter to
possess the land
when ye go ye shall come unto a people secure and to a large
land for god hath given it into your hands a place where there is no
want of any thing that is in the earth
and there went from thence of the family of the danites out of
zorah and out of eshtaol six hundred men appointed with weapons of
war
and they went up and pitched in kirjathjearim in judah
wherefore they called that place mahanehdan unto this day behold it
is behind kirjathjearim
and they passed thence unto mount ephraim and came unto the
house of micah
then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
laish and said unto their brethren do ye know that there is in these
houses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten image
now therefore consider what ye have to do
and they turned thitherward and came to the house of the young
man the levite even unto the house of micah and saluted him
and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war
which were of the children of dan stood by the entering of the gate
and the five men that went to spy out the land went up and came
in thither and took the graven image and the ephod and the
teraphim and the molten image and the priest stood in the entering
of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons
of war
and these went into micahs house and fetched the carved image
the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image then said the
priest unto them what do ye   and they said unto him hold thy
peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us and be to us a
father and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest unto the
house of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family
in israel   and the priests heart was glad and he took the
ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst
of the people
so they turned and departed and put the little ones and the
cattle and the carriage before them
and when they were a good way from the house of micah the men
that were in the houses near to micahs house were gathered together
and overtook the children of dan
and they cried unto the children of dan and they turned their
faces and said unto micah what aileth thee that thou comest with
such a company   and he said ye have taken away my gods which i
made and the priest and ye are gone away and what have i more and
what is this that ye say unto me what aileth thee   and the
children of dan said unto him let not thy voice be heard among us
lest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the
lives of thy household
and the children of dan went their way and when micah saw that
they were too strong for him he turned and went back unto his house
and they took the things which micah had made and the priest
which he had and came unto laish unto a people that were at quiet
and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burnt
the city with fire
and there was no deliverer because it was far from zidon and
they had no business with any man and it was in the valley that lieth
by bethrehob and they built a city and dwelt therein
and they called the name of the city dan after the name of dan
their father who was born unto israel howbeit the name of the city
was laish at the first
and the children of dan set up the graven image and jonathan
the son of gershom the son of manasseh he and his sons were priests
to the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land
and they set them up micahs graven image which he made all
the time that the house of god was in shiloh
and it came to pass in those days when there was no king in
israel that there was a certain levite sojourning on the side of
mount ephraim who took to him a concubine out of bethlehemjudah
and his concubine played the whore against him and went away
from him unto her fathers house to bethlehemjudah and was there four
whole months
and her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly unto
her and to bring her again having his servant with him and a couple
of asses and she brought him into her fathers house and when the
father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him
and his father in law the damsels father retained him and he
abode with him three days so they did eat and drink and lodged
there
and it came to pass on the fourth day when they arose early in
the morning that he rose up to depart and the damsels father said
unto his son in law comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread and
afterward go your way
and they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together
for the damsels father had said unto the man be content i pray
thee and tarry all night and let thine heart be merry
and when the man rose up to depart his father in law urged him
therefore he lodged there again
and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart and
the damsels father said comfort thine heart i pray thee and they
tarried until afternoon and they did eat both of them
and when the man rose up to depart he and his concubine and
his servant his father in law the damsels father said unto him
behold now the day draweth toward evening i pray you tarry all
night behold the day groweth to an end lodge here that thine heart
may be merry and to morrow get you early on your way that thou
mayest go home
but the man would not tarry that night but he rose up and
departed and came over against jebus which is jerusalem and there
were with him two asses saddled his concubine also was with him
and when they were by jebus the day was far spent and the
servant said unto his master come i pray thee and let us turn in
into this city of the jebusites and lodge in it
and his master said unto him we will not turn aside hither into
the city of a stranger that is not of the children of israel we will
pass over to gibeah
and he said unto his servant come and let us draw near to one
of these places to lodge all night in gibeah or in ramah
and they passed on and went their way and the sun went down
upon them when they were by gibeah which belongeth to benjamin
and they turned aside thither to go in and to lodge in gibeah
and when he went in he sat him down in a street of the city for
there was no man that took them into his house to lodging
and behold there came an old man from his work out of the
field at even which was also of mount ephraim and he sojourned in
gibeah but the men of the place were benjamites
and when he had lifted up his eyes he saw a wayfaring man in
the street of the city and the old man said whither goest thou and
whence comest thou   and he said unto him we are passing from
bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim from thence am i and
i went to bethlehemjudah but i am now going to the house of the lord
and there is no man that receiveth me to house
yet there is both straw and provender for our asses and there
is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young
man which is with thy servants there is no want of any thing
and the old man said peace be with thee howsoever let all thy
wants lie upon me only lodge not in the street
so he brought him into his house and gave provender unto the
asses and they washed their feet and did eat and drink
now as they were making their hearts merry behold the men of
the city certain sons of belial beset the house round about and
beat at the door and spake to the master of the house the old man
saying bring forth the man that came into thine house that we may
know him
and the man the master of the house went out unto them and
said unto them nay my brethren nay i pray you do not so wickedly
seeing that this man is come into mine house do not this folly
behold here is my daughter a maiden and his concubine them i
will bring out now and humble ye them and do with them what seemeth
good unto you but unto this man do not so vile a thing
but the men would not hearken to him so the man took his
concubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her and
abused her all the night until the morning and when the day began to
spring they let her go
then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at
the door of the mans house where her lord was till it was light
and her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the
house and went out to go his way and behold the woman his
concubine was fallen down at the door of the house and her hands were
upon the threshold
and he said unto her up and let us be going but none
answered
then the man took her up upon an ass and the man rose up and gat him
unto his place
and when he was come into his house he took a knife and laid
hold on his concubine and divided her together with her bones into
twelve pieces and sent her into all the coasts of israel
and it was so that all that saw it said there was no such deed
done nor seen from the day that the children of israel came up out of
the land of egypt unto this day consider of it take advice and
speak your minds
then all the children of israel went out and the congregation
was gathered together as one man from dan even to beersheba with the
land of gilead unto the lord in mizpeh
and the chief of all the people even of all the tribes of
israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of god
four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword
now the children of benjamin heard that the children of israel
were gone up to mizpeh then said the children of israel tell us
how was this wickedness   and the levite the husband of the
woman that was slain answered and said i came into gibeah that
belongeth to benjamin i and my concubine to lodge
and the men of gibeah rose against me and beset the house round
about upon me by night and thought to have slain me and my concubine
have they forced that she is dead
and i took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her
throughout all the country of the inheritance of israel for they have
committed lewdness and folly in israel
behold ye are all children of israel give here your advice and
counsel
and all the people arose as one man saying we will not any of
us go to his tent neither will we any of us turn into his house
but now this shall be the thing which we will do to gibeah we
will go up by lot against it  and we will take ten men of an
hundred throughout all the tribes of israel and an hundred of a
thousand and a thousand out of ten thousand to fetch victual for the
people that they may do when they come to gibeah of benjamin
according to all the folly that they have wrought in israel
so all the men of israel were gathered against the city knit
together as one man
and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of
benjamin saying what wickedness is this that is done among you
now therefore deliver us the men the children of belial which
are in gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil from
israel but the children of benjamin would not hearken to the voice of
their brethren the children of israel
but the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out of
the cities unto gibeah to go out to battle against the children of
israel
and the children of benjamin were numbered at that time out of
the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword beside the
inhabitants of gibeah which were numbered seven hundred chosen men
among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
lefthanded every one could sling stones at an hair breadth and not
miss
and the men of israel beside benjamin were numbered four
hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of war
and the children of israel arose and went up to the house of
god and asked counsel of god and said which of us shall go up first
to the battle against the children of benjamin and the lord said
judah shall go up first
and the children of israel rose up in the morning and encamped
against gibeah
and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin and
the men of israel put themselves in array to fight against them at
gibeah
and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah and
destroyed down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and two
thousand men
and the people the men of israel encouraged themselves and set
their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in
array the first day
and the children of israel went up and wept before the lord
until even and asked counsel of the lord saying shall i go up again
to battle against the children of benjamin my brother and the lord
said go up against him   and the children of israel came near
against the children of benjamin the second day
and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second
day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again
eighteen thousand men all these drew the sword
then all the children of israel and all the people went up
and came unto the house of god and wept and sat there before the
lord and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings and
peace offerings before the lord
and the children of israel enquired of the lord for the ark of
the covenant of god was there in those days  and phinehas the
son of eleazar the son of aaron stood before it in those days
saying shall i yet again go out to battle against the children of
benjamin my brother or shall i cease and the lord said go up for
to morrow i will deliver them into thine hand
and israel set liers in wait round about gibeah
and the children of israel went up against the children of
benjamin on the third day and put themselves in array against gibeah
as at other times
and the children of benjamin went out against the people and
were drawn away from the city and they began to smite of the people
and kill as at other times in the highways of which one goeth up to
the house of god and the other to gibeah in the field about thirty
men of israel
and the children of benjamin said they are smitten down before
us as at the first but the children of israel said let us flee and
draw them from the city unto the highways
and all the men of israel rose up out of their place and put
themselves in array at baaltamar and the liers in wait of israel came
forth out of their places even out of the meadows of gibeah
and there came against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all
israel and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was near
them
and the lord smote benjamin before israel and the children of
israel destroyed of the benjamites that day twenty and five thousand
and an hundred men all these drew the sword
so the children of benjamin saw that they were smitten for the
men of israel gave place to the benjamites because they trusted unto
the liers in wait which they had set beside gibeah
and the liers in wait hasted and rushed upon gibeah and the
liers in wait drew themselves along and smote all the city with the
edge of the sword
now there was an appointed sign between the men of israel and
the liers in wait that they should make a great flame with smoke rise
up out of the city
and when the men of israel retired in the battle benjamin began
to smite and kill of the men of israel about thirty persons for they
said surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle
but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
pillar of smoke the benjamites looked behind them and behold the
flame of the city ascended up to heaven
and when the men of israel turned again the men of benjamin
were amazed for they saw that evil was come upon them
therefore they turned their backs before the men of israel unto
the way of the wilderness but the battle overtook them and them
which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them
thus they inclosed the benjamites round about and chased them
and trode them down with ease over against gibeah toward the
sunrising
and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men all these were
men of valour
and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of
rimmon and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men
and pursued hard after them unto gidom and slew two thousand men of
them
so that all which fell that day of benjamin were twenty and five
thousand men that drew the sword all these were men of valour
but six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
rock rimmon and abode in the rock rimmon four months
and the men of israel turned again upon the children of
benjamin and smote them with the edge of the sword as well the men
of every city as the beast and all that came to hand also they set
on fire all the cities that they came to
now the men of israel had sworn in mizpeh saying there shall
not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife
and the people came to the house of god and abode there till
even before god and lifted up their voices and wept sore  and
said o lord god of israel why is this come to pass in israel that
there should be to day one tribe lacking in israel   and it came
to pass on the morrow that the people rose early and built there an
altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
and the children of israel said who is there among all the
tribes of israel that came not up with the congregation unto the lord
for they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the
lord to mizpeh saying he shall surely be put to death
and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their
brother and said there is one tribe cut off from israel this day
how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing we have
sworn by the lord that we will not give them of our daughters to
wives   and they said what one is there of the tribes of israel
that came not up to mizpeh to the lord and behold there came none
to the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembly
for the people were numbered and behold there were none of the
inhabitants of jabeshgilead there
and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
valiantest and commanded them saying go and smite the inhabitants
of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword with the women and the
children
and this is the thing that ye shall do ye shall utterly destroy
every male and every woman that hath lain by man
and they found among the inhabitants of jabeshgilead four
hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male
and they brought them unto the camp to shiloh which is in the land of
canaan
and the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of
benjamin that were in the rock rimmon and to call peaceably unto
them
and benjamin came again at that time and they gave them wives
which they had saved alive of the women of jabeshgilead and yet so
they sufficed them not
and the people repented them for benjamin because that the lord
had made a breach in the tribes of israel
then the elders of the congregation said how shall we do for
wives for them that remain seeing the women are destroyed out of
benjamin   and they said there must be an inheritance for them
that be escaped of benjamin that a tribe be not destroyed out of
israel
howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters for the
children of israel have sworn saying cursed be he that giveth a wife
to benjamin
then they said behold there is a feast of the lord in shiloh
yearly in a place which is on the north side of bethel on the east
side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem and on the
south of lebonah
therefore they commanded the children of benjamin saying go
and lie in wait in the vineyards  and see and behold if the
daughters of shiloh come out to dance in dances then come ye out of
the vineyards and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of
shiloh and go to the land of benjamin
and it shall be when their fathers or their brethren come unto
us to complain that we will say unto them be favourable unto them
for our sakes because we reserved not to each man his wife in the
war for ye did not give unto them at this time that ye should be
guilty
and the children of benjamin did so and took them wives
according to their number of them that danced whom they caught and
they went and returned unto their inheritance and repaired the
cities and dwelt in them
and the children of israel departed thence at that time every
man to his tribe and to his family and they went out from thence
every man to his inheritance
in those days there was no king in israel every man did that
which was right in his own eyes
the book of ruth
now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there
was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehemjudah went to
sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons
and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife
naomi and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion ephrathites of
bethlehemjudah and they came into the country of moab and continued
there
and elimelech naomis husband died and she was left and her two
sons
and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one
was orpah and the name of the other ruth and they dwelled there
about ten years
and mahlon and chilion died also both of them and the woman was
left of her two sons and her husband
then she arose with her daughters in law that she might return
from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how
that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread
wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her
two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return unto
the land of judah
and naomi said unto her two daughters in law go return each to
her mothers house the lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt
with the dead and with me
the lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house
of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice
and wept
and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy
people
and naomi said turn again my daughters why will ye go with me
are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your
husbands   turn again my daughters go your way for i am too
old to have an husband if i should say i have hope if i should have
an husband also to night and should also bear sons  would ye
tarry for them till they were grown would ye stay for them from
having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your
sakes that the hand of the lord is gone out against me
and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed
her mother in law but ruth clave unto her
and she said behold thy sister in law is gone back unto her
people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister in law
and ruth said intreat me not to leave thee or to return from
following after thee for whither thou goest i will go and where
thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god
my god  where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried
the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and
me
when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her then
she left speaking unto her
so they two went until they came to bethlehem and it came to
pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved
about them and they said is this naomi   and she said unto
them call me not naomi call me mara for the almighty hath dealt
very bitterly with me
i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty
why then call ye me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against me
and the almighty hath afflicted me   so naomi returned and ruth
the moabitess her daughter in law with her which returned out of
the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of
barley harvest
and naomi had a kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth
of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz
and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi let me now go to the
field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight i shall find
grace
and she said unto her go my daughter
and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the
reapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging
unto boaz who was of the kindred of elimelech
and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers
the lord be with you and they answered him the lord bless thee
then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers
whose damsel is this   and the servant that was set over the
reapers answered and said it is the moabitish damsel that came back
with naomi out of the country of moab  and she said i pray you
let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she
came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she
tarried a little in the house
then said boaz unto ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to
glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by
my maidens  let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and
go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shall
not touch thee and when thou art athirst go unto the vessels and
drink of that which the young men have drawn
then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and
said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou
shouldest take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger   and boaz
answered and said unto her it hath fully been shewed me all that
thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine
husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the
land of thy nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest
not heretofore
the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of
the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust
then she said let me find favour in thy sight my lord for that
thou hast comforted me and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto
thine handmaid though i be not like unto one of thine handmaidens
and boaz said unto her at mealtime come thou hither and eat of
the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the
reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was
sufficed and left
and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young men
saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not
and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and
leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not
so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had
gleaned and it was about an ephah of barley
and she took it up and went into the city and her mother in law
saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that
she had reserved after she was sufficed
and her mother in law said unto her where hast thou gleaned to
day  and where wroughtest thou blessed be he that did take knowledge
of thee and she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought
and said the mans name with whom i wrought to day is boaz
and naomi said unto her daughter in law blessed be he of the
lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the
dead and naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of
our next kinsmen
and ruth the moabitess said he said unto me also thou shalt
keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest
and naomi said unto ruth her daughter in law it is good my
daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not
in any other field
so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of
barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother in law
then naomi her mother in law said unto her my daughter shall i
not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee   and now is
not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast  behold he
winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor
wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon
thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto
the man until he shall have done eating and drinking
and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the
place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet
and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do
and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do
and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that
her mother in law bade her
and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he
went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly
and uncovered his feet and laid her down
and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and
turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet
and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine
handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art
a near kinsman
and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou
hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning
inasmuch as thou followedst not young men whether poor or rich
and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou
requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a
virtuous woman
and now it is true that i am thy near kinsman howbeit there is a
kinsman nearer than i
tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will
perform unto thee the part of a kinsman well let him do the
kinsmans part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee
then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as the lord liveth lie
down until the morning
and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before
one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman
came into the floor
also he said bring the vail that thou hast upon thee and hold
it
and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it
on her and she went into the city
and when she came to her mother in law she said who art thou
my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her
and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he
said to me go not empty unto thy mother in law
then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the
matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have
finished the thing this day
then went boaz up to the gate and sat him down there and
behold the kinsman of whom boaz spake came by unto whom he said ho
such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and sat
down
and he took ten men of the elders of the city and said sit ye
down here and they sat down
and he said unto the kinsman naomi that is come again out of the
country of moab selleth a parcel of land which was our brother
elimelechs  and i thought to advertise thee saying buy it
before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people if thou
wilt redeem it redeem it but if thou wilt not redeem it then tell
me that i may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and i
am after thee and he said i will redeem it
then said boaz what day thou buyest the field of the hand of
naomi thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of the
dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance
and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar
mine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for i cannot
redeem it
now this was the manner in former time in israel concerning
redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man
plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour and this was a
testimony in israel
therefore the kinsman said unto boaz buy it for thee so he drew
off his shoe
and boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people ye are
witnesses this day that i have bought all that was elimelechs and
all that was chilions and mahlons of the hand of naomi
moreover ruth the moabitess the wife of mahlon have i purchased
to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance
that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and
from the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day
and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said
we are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come into thine
house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of
israel and do thou worthily in ephratah and be famous in bethlehem
and let thy house be like the house of pharez whom tamar bare
unto judah of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young
woman
so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto
her the lord gave her conception and she bare a son
and the women said unto naomi blessed be the lord which hath
not left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famous
in israel
and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher
of thine old age for thy daughter in law which loveth thee which is
better to thee than seven sons hath born him
and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became
nurse unto it
and the women her neighbours gave it a name saying there is a
son born to naomi and they called his name obed he is the father of
jesse the father of david
now these are the generations of pharez pharez begat hezron
and hezron begat ram and ram begat amminadab  and amminadab
begat nahshon and nahshon begat salmon  and salmon begat boaz
and boaz begat obed  and obed begat jesse and jesse begat david
the first book of samuel
otherwise called
the first book of the kings
now there was a certain man of ramathaimzophim of mount ephraim
and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the
son of tohu the son of zuph an ephrathite  and he had two wives
the name of the one was hannah and the name of the other peninnah
and peninnah had children but hannah had no children
and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
sacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh and the two sons of eli
hophni and phinehas the priests of the lord were there
and when the time was that elkanah offered he gave to peninnah
his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions  but
unto hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved hannah but the
lord had shut up her womb
and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret
because the lord had shut up her womb
and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of
the lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat
then said elkanah her husband to her hannah why weepest thou
and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not i better
to thee than ten sons   so hannah rose up after they had eaten in
shiloh and after they had drunk now eli the priest sat upon a seat
by a post of the temple of the lord
and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and
wept sore
and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou wilt
indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and
not forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man
child then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life
and there shall no razor come upon his head
and it came to pass as she continued praying before the lord
that eli marked her mouth
now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her
voice was not heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken
and eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put away
thy wine from thee
and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a
sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have
poured out my soul before the lord
count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial for out of the
abundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto
then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel
grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him
and she said let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight so the
woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad
and they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the
lord and returned and came to their house to ramah and elkanah knew
hannah his wife and the lord remembered her
wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after
hannah had conceived that she bare a son and called his name samuel
saying because i have asked him of the lord
and the man elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the
lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow
but hannah went not up for she said unto her husband i will not
go up until the child be weaned and then i will bring him that he
may appear before the lord and there abide for ever
and elkanah her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good
tarry until thou have weaned him only the lord establish his word so
the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him
and when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three
bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine and brought
him unto the house of the lord in shiloh and the child was young
and they slew a bullock and brought the child to eli
and she said oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord i am the
woman that stood by thee here praying unto the lord
for this child i prayed and the lord hath given me my petition
which i asked of him  therefore also i have lent him to the lord
as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord and he worshipped
the lord there
and hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the lord mine
horn is exalted in the lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies
because i rejoice in thy salvation
there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee
neither is there any rock like our god
talk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out of
your mouth for the lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are
weighed
the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are
girded with strength
they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they
that were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven and she
that hath many children is waxed feeble
the lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave
and bringeth up
the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and
lifteth up
he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar
from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit
the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lords and
he hath set the world upon them
he will keep the feet of his saints and the wicked shall be
silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail
the adversaries of the lord shall be broken to pieces out of
heaven shall he thunder upon them the lord shall judge the ends of
the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the
horn of his anointed
and elkanah went to ramah to his house and the child did
minister unto the lord before eli the priest
now the sons of eli were sons of belial they knew not the lord
and the priests custom with the people was that when any man
offered sacrifice the priests servant came while the flesh was in
seething with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand  and he
struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the
fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself so they did in
shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither
also before they burnt the fat the priests servant came and
said to the man that sacrificed give flesh to roast for the priest
for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw
and if any man said unto him let them not fail to burn the fat
presently and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he would
answer him nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not i will
take it by force
wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
lord for men abhorred the offering of the lord
but samuel ministered before the lord being a child girded with
a linen ephod
moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to him
from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the
yearly sacrifice
and eli blessed elkanah and his wife and said the lord give
thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the lord and
they went unto their own home
and the lord visited hannah so that she conceived and bare
three sons and two daughters and the child samuel grew before the
lord
now eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all
israel and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation
and he said unto them why do ye such things for i hear of your
evil dealings by all this people
nay my sons for it is no good report that i hear ye make the
lords people to transgress
if one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but if
a man sin against the lord who shall intreat for him notwithstanding
they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the lord
would slay them
and the child samuel grew on and was in favour both with the
lord and also with men
and there came a man of god unto eli and said unto him thus
saith the lord did i plainly appear unto the house of thy father
when they were in egypt in pharaohs house   and did i choose him
out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest to offer upon mine
altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did i give
unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the
children of israel   wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at
mine offering which i have commanded in my habitation and honourest
thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the
offerings of israel my people   wherefore the lord god of israel
saith i said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father
should walk before me for ever but now the lord saith be it far from
me for them that honour me i will honour and they that despise me
shall be lightly esteemed
behold the days come that i will cut off thine arm and the arm
of thy fathers house that there shall not be an old man in thine
house
and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth
which god shall give israel and there shall not be an old man in
thine house for ever
and the man of thine whom i shall not cut off from mine altar
shall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart and all the
increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age
and this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two
sons on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them
and i will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according
to that which is in mine heart and in my mind and i will build him a
sure house and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever
and it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thine
house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel
of bread and shall say put me i pray thee into one of the priests
offices that i may eat a piece of bread
and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the
word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision
and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his
place and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see  and
ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the ark
of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep  that the lord
called samuel and he answered here am i
and he ran unto eli and said here am i for thou calledst me
and he said i called not lie down again and he went and lay down
and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel arose and went
to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and he answered
i called not my son lie down again
now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the
lord yet revealed unto him
and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose and
went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and eli
perceived that the lord had called the child
therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if
he call thee that thou shalt say speak lord for thy servant
heareth so samuel went and lay down in his place
and the lord came and stood and called as at other times
samuel samuel then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth
and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel
at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle
in that day i will perform against eli all things which i have
spoken concerning his house when i begin i will also make an end
for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for the
iniquity which he knoweth because his sons made themselves vile and
he restrained them not
and therefore i have sworn unto the house of eli that the
iniquity of elis house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor
offering for ever
and samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the
house of the lord and samuel feared to shew eli the vision
then eli called samuel and said samuel my son and he
answered here am i
and he said what is the thing that the lord hath said unto thee
i pray thee hide it not from me god do so to thee and more also if
thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee
and samuel told him every whit and hid nothing from him and he
said it is the lord let him do what seemeth him good
and samuel grew and the lord was with him and did let none of
his words fall to the ground
and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel was
established to be a prophet of the lord
and the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord revealed
himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord
and the word of samuel came to all israel now israel went out
against the philistines to battle and pitched beside ebenezer and
the philistines pitched in aphek
and the philistines put themselves in array against israel and
when they joined battle israel was smitten before the philistines
and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men
and when the people were come into the camp the elders of israel
said wherefore hath the lord smitten us to day before the
philistines let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of
shiloh unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out of
the hand of our enemies
so the people sent to shiloh that they might bring from thence
the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwelleth between
the cherubims and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were
there with the ark of the covenant of god
and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp
all israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang again
and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they said
what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews
and they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp
and the philistines were afraid for they said god is come into
the camp and they said woe unto us for there hath not been such a
thing heretofore
woe unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty
gods these are the gods that smote the egyptians with all the plagues
in the wilderness
be strong and quit yourselves like men o ye philistines that ye
be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quit
yourselves like men and fight
and the philistines fought and israel was smitten and they fled
every man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter for
there fell of israel thirty thousand footmen
and the ark of god was taken and the two sons of eli hophni and
phinehas were slain
and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army and came to
shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his
head
and when he came lo eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
watching for his heart trembled for the ark of god and when the man
came into the city and told it all the city cried out
and when eli heard the noise of the crying he said what meaneth
the noise of this tumult and the man came in hastily and told eli
now eli was ninety and eight years old and his eyes were dim
that he could not see
and the man said unto eli i am he that came out of the army and
i fled to day out of the army and he said what is there done my
son   and the messenger answered and said israel is fled before
the philistines and there hath been also a great slaughter among the
people and thy two sons also hophni and phinehas are dead and the
ark of god is taken
and it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of god that
he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his
neck brake and he died for he was an old man and heavy and he had
judged israel forty years
and his daughter in law phinehas wife was with child near to
be delivered and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god was
taken and that her father in law and her husband were dead she bowed
herself and travailed for her pains came upon her
and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said
unto her fear not for thou hast born a son but she answered not
neither did she regard it
and she named the child ichabod saying the glory is departed
from israel because the ark of god was taken and because of her
father in law and her husband
and she said the glory is departed from israel for the ark of
god is taken
and the philistines took the ark of god and brought it from
ebenezer unto ashdod
when the philistines took the ark of god they brought it into the
house of dagon and set it by dagon
and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow behold dagon
was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the lord and
they took dagon and set him in his place again
and when they arose early on the morrow morning behold dagon was
fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord and the
head of dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the
threshold only the stump of dagon was left to him
therefore neither the priests of dagon nor any that come into
dagons house tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this
day
but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod and he
destroyed them and smote them with emerods even ashdod and the
coasts thereof
and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so they said the ark
of the god of israel shall not abide with us for his hand is sore
upon us and upon dagon our god
they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistines
unto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the god of
israel and they answered let the ark of the god of israel be carried
about unto gath and they carried the ark of the god of israel about
thither
and it was so that after they had carried it about the hand of
the lord was against the city with a very great destruction and he
smote the men of the city both small and great and they had emerods
in their secret parts
therefore they sent the ark of god to ekron and it came to pass
as the ark of god came to ekron that the ekronites cried out saying
they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us to slay us
and our people
so they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
philistines and said send away the ark of the god of israel and let
it go again to his own place that it slay us not and our people for
there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city the hand of
god was very heavy there
and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods and the
cry of the city went up to heaven
and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines
seven months
and the philistines called for the priests and the diviners
saying what shall we do to the ark of the lord tell us wherewith we
shall send it to his place
and they said if ye send away the ark of the god of israel send
it not empty but in any wise return him a trespass offering then ye
shall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is not
removed from you
then said they what shall be the trespass offering which we shall
return to him they answered five golden emerods and five golden
mice according to the number of the lords of the philistines for one
plague was on you all and on your lords
wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods and images of your
mice that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the god of
israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from
off your gods and from off your land
wherefore then do ye harden your hearts as the egyptians and
pharaoh hardened their hearts when he had wrought wonderfully among
them did they not let the people go and they departed   now
therefore make a new cart and take two milch kine on which there
hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their
calves home from them  and take the ark of the lord and lay it
upon the cart and put the jewels of gold which ye return him for a
trespass offering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it away
that it may go
and see if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
bethshemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then we
shall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that
happened to us
and the men did so and took two milch kine and tied them to the
cart and shut up their calves at home  and they laid the ark of
the lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and the
images of their emerods
and the kine took the straight way to the way of bethshemesh and
went along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to
the right hand or to the left and the lords of the philistines went
after them unto the border of bethshemesh
and they of bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the
valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced
to see it
and the cart came into the field of joshua a bethshemite and
stood there where there was a great stone and they clave the wood of
the cart and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the lord
and the levites took down the ark of the lord and the coffer
that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on the
great stone and the men of bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and
sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord
and when the five lords of the philistines had seen it they
returned to ekron the same day
and these are the golden emerods which the philistines returned
for a trespass offering unto the lord for ashdod one for gaza one
for askelon one for gath one for ekron one  and the golden
mice according to the number of all the cities of the philistines
belonging to the five lords both of fenced cities and of country
villages even unto the great stone of abel whereon they set down the
ark of the lord which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of
joshua the bethshemite
and he smote the men of bethshemesh because they had looked into
the ark of the lord even he smote of the people fifty thousand and
threescore and ten men and the people lamented because the lord had
smitten many of the people with a great slaughter
and the men of bethshemesh said who is able to stand before this
holy lord god and to whom shall he go up from us   and they sent
messengers to the inhabitants of kirjathjearim saying the
philistines have brought again the ark of the lord come ye down and
fetch it up to you
and the men of kirjathjearim came and fetched up the ark of the
lord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill and
sanctified eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord
and it came to pass while the ark abode in kirjathjearim that
the time was long for it was twenty years and all the house of
israel lamented after the lord
and samuel spake unto all the house of israel saying if ye do
return unto the lord with all your hearts then put away the strange
gods and ashtaroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the
lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of
the philistines
then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth and
served the lord only
and samuel said gather all israel to mizpeh and i will pray for
you unto the lord
and they gathered together to mizpeh and drew water and poured
it out before the lord and fasted on that day and said there we
have sinned against the lord and samuel judged the children of israel
in mizpeh
and when the philistines heard that the children of israel were
gathered together to mizpeh the lords of the philistines went up
against israel and when the children of israel heard it they were
afraid of the philistines
and the children of israel said to samuel cease not to cry unto
the lord our god for us that he will save us out of the hand of the
philistines
and samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt
offering wholly unto the lord and samuel cried unto the lord for
israel and the lord heard him
and as samuel was offering up the burnt offering the philistines
drew near to battle against israel but the lord thundered with a
great thunder on that day upon the philistines and discomfited them
and they were smitten before israel
and the men of israel went out of mizpeh and pursued the
philistines and smote them until they came under bethcar
then samuel took a stone and set it between mizpeh and shen and
called the name of it ebenezer saying hitherto hath the lord helped
us
so the philistines were subdued and they came no more into the
coast of israel and the hand of the lord was against the philistines
all the days of samuel
and the cities which the philistines had taken from israel were
restored to israel from ekron even unto gath and the coasts thereof
did israel deliver out of the hands of the philistines and there was
peace between israel and the amorites
and samuel judged israel all the days of his life
and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgal
and mizpeh and judged israel in all those places
and his return was to ramah for there was his house and there
he judged israel and there he built an altar unto the lord
and it came to pass when samuel was old that he made his sons
judges over israel
now the name of his firstborn was joel and the name of his
second abiah they were judges in beersheba
and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre
and took bribes and perverted judgment
then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and
came to samuel unto ramah  and said unto him behold thou art
old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us
like all the nations
but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to
judge us and samuel prayed unto the lord
and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the
people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected
thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them
according to all the works which they have done since the day that
i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day wherewith they have
forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee
now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest
solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall
reign over them
and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that
asked of him a king
and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign
over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for
his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his
chariots
and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains
over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his
harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his
chariots
and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be
cooks and to be bakers
and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your
oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants
and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards
and give to his officers and to his servants
and he will take your menservants and your maidservants and
your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work
he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his
servants
and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
shall have chosen you and the lord will not hear you in that day
nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and
they said nay but we will have a king over us  that we also may
be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out
before us and fight our battles
and samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed
them in the ears of the lord
and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their voice and make
them a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man
unto his city
now there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son of
abiel the son of zeror the son of bechorath the son of aphiah a
benjamite a mighty man of power
and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a
goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier
person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any
of the people
and the asses of kish sauls father were lost and kish said to
saul his son take now one of the servants with thee and arise go
seek the asses
and he passed through mount ephraim and passed through the land
of shalisha but they found them not then they passed through the
land of shalim and there they were not and he passed through the
land of the benjamites but they found them not
and when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to his
servant that was with him come and let us return lest my father
leave caring for the asses and take thought for us
and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of
god and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely to
pass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way that
we should go
then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall
we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is
not a present to bring to the man of god what have we   and the
servant answered saul again and said behold i have here at hand the
fourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of god
to tell us our way
beforetime in israel when a man went to enquire of god thus he
spake come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a
prophet was beforetime called a seer   then said saul to his
servant well said come let us go so they went unto the city where
the man of god was
and as they went up the hill to the city they found young
maidens going out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here
and they answered them and said he is behold he is before
you make haste now for he came to day to the city for there is a
sacrifice of the people to day in the high place  as soon as ye
be come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go up
to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come
because he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that be
bidden now therefore get you up for about this time ye shall find
him
and they went up into the city and when they were come into the
city behold samuel came out against them for to go up to the high
place
now the lord had told samuel in his ear a day before saul came
saying  to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out of
the land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my
people israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the
philistines for i have looked upon my people because their cry is
come unto me
and when samuel saw saul the lord said unto him behold the man
whom i spake to thee of this same shall reign over my people
then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me i
pray thee where the seers house is
and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before
me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow
i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart
and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thy
mind on them for they are found and on whom is all the desire of
israel is it not on thee and on all thy fathers house   and
saul answered and said am not i a benjamite of the smallest of the
tribes of israel and my family the least of all the families of the
tribe of benjamin wherefore then speakest thou so to me   and
samuel took saul and his servant and brought them into the parlour
and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden
which were about thirty persons
and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gave
thee of which i said unto thee set it by thee
and the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it
and set it before saul and samuel said behold that which is left
set it before thee and eat for unto this time hath it been kept for
thee since i said i have invited the people so saul did eat with
samuel that day
and when they were come down from the high place into the city
samuel communed with saul upon the top of the house
and they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the
day that samuel called saul to the top of the house saying up that
i may send thee away and saul arose and they went out both of them
he and samuel abroad
and as they were going down to the end of the city samuel said
to saul bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on but
stand thou still a while that i may shew thee the word of god
then samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and
kissed him and said is it not because the lord hath anointed thee to
be captain over his inheritance   when thou art departed from me
to day then thou shalt find two men by rachels sepulchre in the
border of benjamin at zelzah and they will say unto thee the asses
which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left
the care of the asses and sorroweth for you saying what shall i do
for my son   then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou
shalt come to the plain of tabor and there shall meet thee three men
going up to god to bethel one carrying three kids and another
carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine
and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread
which thou shalt receive of their hands
after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the
garrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art
come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets
coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and a
pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy  and the
spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with
them and shalt be turned into another man
and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do
as occasion serve thee for god is with thee
and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal and behold i will
come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice
sacrifices of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry till i
come to thee and shew thee what thou shalt do
and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from
samuel god gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass
that day
and when they came thither to the hill behold a company of
prophets met him and the spirit of god came upon him and he
prophesied among them
and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that
behold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one to
another what is this that is come unto the son of kish is saul also
among the prophets   and one of the same place answered and
said but who is their father therefore it became a proverb is saul
also among the prophets   and when he had made an end of
prophesying he came to the high place
and sauls uncle said unto him and to his servant whither went
ye  and he said to seek the asses and when we saw that they were no
where we came to samuel
and sauls uncle said tell me i pray thee what samuel said
unto you
and saul said unto his uncle he told us plainly that the asses
were found but of the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spake he
told him not
and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh
and said unto the children of israel thus saith the lord god of
israel i brought up israel out of egypt and delivered you out of the
hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of
them that oppressed you  and ye have this day rejected your god
who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your
tribulations and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over us
now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and
by your thousands
and when samuel had caused all the tribes of israel to come
near the tribe of benjamin was taken
when he had caused the tribe of benjamin to come near by their
families the family of matri was taken and saul the son of kish was
taken and when they sought him he could not be found
therefore they enquired of the lord further if the man should
yet come thither and the lord answered behold he hath hid himself
among the stuff
and they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the
people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and
upward
and samuel said to all the people see ye him whom the lord hath
chosen that there is none like him among all the people and all the
people shouted and said god save the king
then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote
it in a book and laid it up before the lord and samuel sent all the
people away every man to his house
and saul also went home to gibeah and there went with him a
band of men whose hearts god had touched
but the children of belial said how shall this man save us and
they despised him and brought no presents but he held his peace
then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped against
jabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a
covenant with us and we will serve thee
and nahash the ammonite answered them on this condition will i
make a covenant with you that i may thrust out all your right eyes
and lay it for a reproach upon all israel
and the elders of jabesh said unto him give us seven days
respite that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of israel
and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee
then came the messengers to gibeah of saul and told the tidings
in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices
and wept
and behold saul came after the herd out of the field and saul
said what aileth the people that they weep and they told him the
tidings of the men of jabesh
and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings
and his anger was kindled greatly
and he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent
them throughout all the coasts of israel by the hands of messengers
saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so
shall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the lord fell on the
people and they came out with one consent
and when he numbered them in bezek the children of israel were
three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand
and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye say
unto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hot
ye shall have help and the messengers came and shewed it to the men
of jabesh and they were glad
therefore the men of jabesh said to morrow we will come out
unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you
and it was so on the morrow that saul put the people in three
companies and they came into the midst of the host in the morning
watch and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day and it came
to pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of them
were not left together
and the people said unto samuel who is he that said shall saul
reign over us bring the men that we may put them to death
and saul said there shall not a man be put to death this day
for to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel
then said samuel to the people come and let us go to gilgal
and renew the kingdom there
and all the people went to gilgal and there they made saul king
before the lord in gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of
peace offerings before the lord and there saul and all the men of
israel rejoiced greatly
and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearkened unto
your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you
and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old and
grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walked
before you from my childhood unto this day
behold here i am witness against me before the lord and before
his anointed whose ox have i taken or whose ass have i taken or
whom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have i
received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith and i will restore it
you
and they said thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us
neither hast thou taken ought of any mans hand
and he said unto them the lord is witness against you and his
anointed is witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hand
and they answered he is witness
and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced
moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of
egypt
now therefore stand still that i may reason with you before the
lord of all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and to
your fathers
when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto the
lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your
fathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place
and when they forgat the lord their god he sold them into the
hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the
philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought
against them
and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned because
we have forsaken the lord and have served baalim and ashtaroth but
now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee
and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and
samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every
side and ye dwelled safe
and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon
came against you ye said unto me nay but a king shall reign over
us when the lord your god was your king
now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye
have desired and behold the lord hath set a king over you
if ye will fear the lord and serve him and obey his voice and
not rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall both ye and
also the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord your
god  but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord but rebel
against the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lord
be against you as it was against your fathers
now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lord
will do before your eyes
is it not wheat harvest to day i will call unto the lord and
he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your
wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord in
asking you a king
so samuel called unto the lord and the lord sent thunder and
rain that day and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel
and all the people said unto samuel pray for thy servants unto
the lord thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sins
this evil to ask us a king
and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this
wickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the
lord with all your heart  and turn ye not aside for then should
ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are
vain
for the lord will not forsake his people for his great names
sake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people
moreover as for me god forbid that i should sin against the
lord in ceasing to pray for you but i will teach you the good and the
right way  only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all
your heart for consider how great things he hath done for you
but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both ye
and your king
saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over
israel  saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof two
thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel and a
thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin and the rest of the
people he sent every man to his tent
and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in
geba and the philistines heard of it and saul blew the trumpet
throughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear
and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of the
philistines and that israel also was had in abomination with the
philistines and the people were called together after saul to gilgal
and the philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and
people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude and they
came up and pitched in michmash eastward from bethaven
when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait for the
people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves
and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits
and some of the hebrews went over jordan to the land of gad and
gilead as for saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed
him trembling
and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel
had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were
scattered from him
and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace
offerings and he offered the burnt offering
and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of
offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to
meet him that he might salute him
and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because i
saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not
within the days appointed and that the philistines gathered
themselves together at michmash  therefore said i the
philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made
supplication unto the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a
burnt offering
and samuel said to saul thou hast done foolishly thou hast not
kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for
now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever
but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him
a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be
captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the
lord commanded thee
and samuel arose and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of
benjamin and saul numbered the people that were present with him
about six hundred men
and saul and jonathan his son and the people that were present
with them abode in gibeah of benjamin but the philistines encamped
in michmash
and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines in
three companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth to
ophrah unto the land of shual  and another company turned the
way to bethhoron and another company turned to the way of the border
that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness
now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel
for the philistines said lest the hebrews make them swords or spears
but all the israelites went down to the philistines to sharpen
every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock
yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and
for the forks and for the axes and to sharpen the goads
so it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither
sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with
saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son was there
found
and the garrison of the philistines went out to the passage of
michmash
now it came to pass upon a day that jonathan the son of saul
said unto the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over
to the philistines garrison that is on the other side but he told
not his father
and saul tarried in the uttermost part of gibeah under a
pomegranate tree which is in migron and the people that were with him
were about six hundred men  and ahiah the son of ahitub
ichabods brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the lords
priest in shiloh wearing an ephod and the people knew not that
jonathan was gone
and between the passages by which jonathan sought to go over
unto the philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the one
side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one was
bozez and the name of the other seneh
the forefront of the one was situate northward over against
michmash and the other southward over against gibeah
and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour come
and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be
that the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lord
to save by many or by few
and his armourbearer said unto him do all that is in thine
heart turn thee behold i am with thee according to thy heart
then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men and
we will discover ourselves unto them
if they say thus unto us tarry until we come to you then we
will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them
but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for
the lord hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign
unto us
and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
philistines and the philistines said behold the hebrews come forth
out of the holes where they had hid themselves
and the men of the garrison answered jonathan and his
armourbearer and said come up to us and we will shew you a thing
and jonathan said unto his armourbearer come up after me for the
lord hath delivered them into the hand of israel
and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and
his armourbearer after him and they fell before jonathan and his
armourbearer slew after him
and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armourbearer
made was about twenty men within as it were an half acre of land
which a yoke of oxen might plow
and there was trembling in the host in the field and among all
the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and
the earth quaked so it was a very great trembling
and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked and
behold the multitude melted away and they went on beating down one
another
then said saul unto the people that were with him number now
and see who is gone from us and when they had numbered behold
jonathan and his armourbearer were not there
and saul said unto ahiah bring hither the ark of god for the
ark of god was at that time with the children of israel
and it came to pass while saul talked unto the priest that the
noise that was in the host of the philistines went on and increased
and saul said unto the priest withdraw thine hand
and saul and all the people that were with him assembled
themselves and they came to the battle and behold every mans
sword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture
moreover the hebrews that were with the philistines before that
time which went up with them into the camp from the country round
about even they also turned to be with the israelites that were with
saul and jonathan
likewise all the men of israel which had hid themselves in mount
ephraim when they heard that the philistines fled even they also
followed hard after them in the battle
so the lord saved israel that day and the battle passed over
unto bethaven
and the men of israel were distressed that day for saul had
adjured the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food
until evening that i may be avenged on mine enemies so none of the
people tasted any food
and all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey
upon the ground
and when the people were come into the wood behold the honey
dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared
the oath
but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his
hand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth
and his eyes were enlightened
then answered one of the people and said thy father straitly
charged the people with an oath saying cursed be the man that eateth
any food this day and the people were faint
then said jonathan my father hath troubled the land see i
pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because i tasted a
little of this honey
how much more if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
the spoil of their enemies which they found for had there not been
now a much greater slaughter among the philistines   and they
smote the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon and the
people were very faint
and the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen
and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them
with the blood
then they told saul saying behold the people sin against the
lord in that they eat with the blood and he said ye have
transgressed roll a great stone unto me this day
and saul said disperse yourselves among the people and say
unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep
and slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eating
with the blood
and all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and
slew them there
and saul built an altar unto the lord the same was the first
altar that he built unto the lord
and saul said let us go down after the philistines by night
and spoil them until the morning light and let us not leave a man of
them and they said do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee then said
the priest let us draw near hither unto god
and saul asked counsel of god shall i go down after the
philistines wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel but he
answered him not that day
and saul said draw ye near hither all the chief of the people
and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day
for as the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be in
jonathan my son he shall surely die but there was not a man among
all the people that answered him
then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i and
jonathan my son will be on the other side and the people said unto
saul do what seemeth good unto thee
therefore saul said unto the lord god of israel give a perfect
lot
and saul and jonathan were taken but the people escaped
and saul said cast lots between me and jonathan my son and
jonathan was taken
then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done and
jonathan told him and said i did but taste a little honey with the
end of the rod that was in mine hand and lo i must die
and saul answered god do so and more also for thou shalt
surely die jonathan
and the people said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath
wrought this great salvation in israel god forbid as the lord
liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for
he hath wrought with god this day so the people rescued jonathan
that he died not
then saul went up from following the philistines and the
philistines went to their own place
so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all his
enemies on every side against moab and against the children of
ammon and against edom and against the kings of zobah and against
the philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he vexed them
and he gathered an host and smote the amalekites and delivered
israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them
now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishui and melchishua
and the names of his two daughters were these the name of the
firstborn merab and the name of the younger michal  and the
name of sauls wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz and the name
of the captain of his host was abner the son of ner sauls uncle
and kish was the father of saul and ner the father of abner was
the son of abiel
and there was sore war against the philistines all the days of
saul and when saul saw any strong man or any valiant man he took
him unto him
samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be
king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the
voice of the words of the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek did to
israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from
egypt
now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have
and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling
ox and sheep camel and ass
and saul gathered the people together and numbered them in
telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah
and saul came to a city of amalek and laid wait in the valley
and saul said unto the kenites go depart get you down from
among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for ye shewed
kindness to all the children of israel when they came up out of
egypt so the kenites departed from among the amalekites
and saul smote the amalekites from havilah until thou comest to
shur that is over against egypt
and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly
destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword
but saul and the people spared agag and the best of the sheep
and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was
good and would not utterly destroy them but every thing that was
vile and refuse that they destroyed utterly
then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying  it
repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned back
from following me and hath not performed my commandments and it
grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night
and when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning it was
told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a
place and is gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal
and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou
of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord
and samuel said what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in
mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear   and saul
said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people
spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the
lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed
then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the
lord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on
and samuel said when thou wast little in thine own sight wast
thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed
thee king over israel   and the lord sent thee on a journey and
said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight
against them until they be consumed
wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord but
didst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the lord
and saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of the
lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought
agag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites
but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of
the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto
the lord thy god in gilgal
and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt
offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold
to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams
for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is
as iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the
lord he hath also rejected thee from being king
and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i have
transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i
feared the people and obeyed their voice
now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with
me that i may worship the lord
and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou
hast rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee
from being king over israel
and as samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon the
skirt of his mantle and it rent
and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of
israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbour of thine
that is better than thou
and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he
is not a man that he should repent
then he said i have sinned yet honour me now i pray thee
before the elders of my people and before israel and turn again with
me that i may worship the lord thy god
so samuel turned again after saul and saul worshipped the lord
then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the
amalekites and agag came unto him delicately and agag said surely
the bitterness of death is past
and samuel said as the sword hath made women childless so
shall thy mother be childless among women and samuel hewed agag in
pieces before the lord in gilgal
then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house to
gibeah of saul
and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death
nevertheless samuel mourned for saul and the lord repented that he
had made saul king over israel
and the lord said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saul
seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel fill thine horn
with oil and go i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i
have provided me a king among his sons
and samuel said how can i go if saul hear it he will kill me
and the lord said take an heifer with thee and say i am come to
sacrifice to the lord
and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will shew thee what thou
shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee
and samuel did that which the lord spake and came to bethlehem
and the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said comest
thou peaceably   and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice
unto the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice
and he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to the
sacrifice
and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on
eliab and said surely the lords anointed is before him
but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on
the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord
seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but
the lord looketh on the heart
then jesse called abinadab and made him pass before samuel and
he said neither hath the lord chosen this
then jesse made shammah to pass by and he said neither hath the
lord chosen this
again jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel and
samuel said unto jesse the lord hath not chosen these
and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and he
said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the
sheep and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not
sit down till he come hither
and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and withal of
a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the lord said
arise anoint him for this is he
then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst
of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that
day forward so samuel rose up and went to ramah
but the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an evil
spirit from the lord troubled him
and sauls servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit
from god troubleth thee
let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to
seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come
to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall
play with his hand and thou shalt be well
and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can
play well and bring him to me
then answered one of the servants and said behold i have seen
a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a
mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a
comely person and the lord is with him
wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me
david thy son which is with the sheep
and jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine
and a kid and sent them by david his son unto saul
and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him
greatly and he became his armourbearer
and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee stand
before me for he hath found favour in my sight
and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon
saul that david took an harp and played with his hand so saul was
refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him
now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and
were gathered together at shochoh which belongeth to judah and
pitched between shochoh and azekah in ephesdammim
and saul and the men of israel were gathered together and
pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in array against the
philistines
and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and
israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley
between them
and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines
named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span
and he had an helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed
with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand
shekels of brass
and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass
between his shoulders
and the staff of his spear was like a weavers beam and his
spears head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing a
shield went before him
and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto
them why are ye come out to set your battle in array am not i a
philistine and ye servants to saul choose you a man for you and let
him come down to me
if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be
your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall
ye be our servants and serve us
and the philistine said i defy the armies of israel this day
give me a man that we may fight together
when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine
they were dismayed and greatly afraid
now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah
whose name was jesse and he had eight sons and the man went among
men for an old man in the days of saul
and the three eldest sons of jesse went and followed saul to the
battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were
eliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third
shammah
and david was the youngest and the three eldest followed saul
but david went and returned from saul to feed his fathers sheep
at bethlehem
and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presented
himself forty days
and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren an
ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp
of thy brethren  and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of
their thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge
now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the
valley of elah fighting with the philistines
and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with
a keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he came
to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and shouted
for the battle
for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array army
against army
and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren
and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion
the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies of the
philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard
them
and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him
and were sore afraid
and the men of israel said have ye seen this man that is come
up  surely to defy israel is he come up and it shall be that the
man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and
will give him his daughter and make his fathers house free in
israel
and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall
be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the
reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that
he should defy the armies of the living god   and the people
answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man
that killeth him
and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men
and eliabs anger was kindled against david and he said why camest
thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the
wilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for
thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle
and david said what have i now done is there not a cause
and he turned from him toward another and spake after the same
manner and the people answered him again after the former manner
and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed
them before saul and he sent for him
and david said to saul let no mans heart fail because of him
thy servant will go and fight with this philistine
and saul said to david thou art not able to go against this
philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man
of war from his youth
and david said unto saul thy servant kept his fathers sheep
and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock
and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of
his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard
and smote him and slew him
thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this
uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath
defied the armies of the living god
david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paw
of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of
the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and the
lord be with thee
and saul armed david with his armour and he put an helmet of
brass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mail
and david girded his sword upon his armour and he assayed to
go for he had not proved it and david said unto saul i cannot go
with these for i have not proved them and david put them off him
and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth
stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherds bag which he
had even in a scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near
to the philistine
and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the man
that bare the shield went before him
and when the philistine looked about and saw david he
disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair
countenance
and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comest
to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods
and the philistine said to david come to me and i will give
thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field
then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a
sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the
name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou
hast defied
this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand and i will
smite thee and take thine head from thee and i will give the
carcases of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the
air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know
that there is a god in israel
and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with
sword and spear for the battle is the lords and he will give you
into our hands
and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and
drew nigh to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the army
to meet the philistine
and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and
slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stone
sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth
so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a
stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword
in the hand of david
therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and took his
sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut
off his head therewith and when the philistines saw their champion
was dead they fled
and the men of israel and of judah arose and shouted and
pursued the philistines until thou come to the valley and to the
gates of ekron
and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim
even unto gath and unto ekron
and the children of israel returned from chasing after the
philistines and they spoiled their tents
and david took the head of the philistine and brought it to
jerusalem but he put his armour in his tent
and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine he said
unto abner the captain of the host abner whose son is this youth
and abner said as thy soul liveth o king i cannot tell
and the king said enquire thou whose son the stripling is
and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine
abner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the
philistine in his hand
and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man and
david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite
and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto
saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and
jonathan loved him as his own soul
and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to
his fathers house
then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as
his own soul
and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and
gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow
and to his girdle
and david went out whithersoever saul sent him and behaved
himself wisely and saul set him over the men of war and he was
accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of
sauls servants
and it came to pass as they came when david was returned from
the slaughter of the philistine that the women came out of all cities
of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tabrets with
joy and with instruments of musick
and the women answered one another as they played and said saul
hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands
and saul was very wroth and the saying displeased him and he
said they have ascribed unto david ten thousands and to me they have
ascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdom
and saul eyed david from that day and forward
and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from god
came upon saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and david
played with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin in
sauls hand
and saul cast the javelin for he said i will smite david even
to the wall with it and david avoided out of his presence twice
and saul was afraid of david because the lord was with him and
was departed from saul
therefore saul removed him from him and made him his captain
over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people
and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the lord
was with him
wherefore when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he
was afraid of him
but all israel and judah loved david because he went out and
came in before them
and saul said to david behold my elder daughter merab her will
i give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight the lords
battles
for saul said let not mine hand be upon him but let the hand of the
philistines be upon him
and david said unto saul who am i and what is my life or my
fathers family in israel that i should be son in law to the king
but it came to pass at the time when merab sauls daughter
should have been given to david that she was given unto adriel the
meholathite to wife
and michal sauls daughter loved david and they told saul and
the thing pleased him
and saul said i will give him her that she may be a snare to
him and that the hand of the philistines may be against him
wherefore saul said to david thou shalt this day be my son in law in
the one of the twain
and saul commanded his servants saying commune with david
secretly and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all his
servants love thee now therefore be the kings son in law
and sauls servants spake those words in the ears of david and
david said seemeth it to you a light thing to be a kings son in law
seeing that i am a poor man and lightly esteemed   and the
servants of saul told him saying on this manner spake david
and saul said thus shall ye say to david the king desireth not
any dowry but an hundred foreskins of the philistines to be avenged
of the kings enemies but saul thought to make david fall by the hand
of the philistines
and when his servants told david these words it pleased david
well to be the kings son in law and the days were not expired
wherefore david arose and went he and his men and slew of the
philistines two hundred men and david brought their foreskins and
they gave them in full tale to the king that he might be the kings
son in law and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife
and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david and that
michal sauls daughter loved him
and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul became
davids enemy continually
then the princes of the philistines went forth and it came to
pass after they went forth that david behaved himself more wisely
than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by
and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants that
they should kill david
but jonathan sauls son delighted much in david and jonathan
told david saying saul my father seeketh to kill thee now
therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and
abide in a secret place and hide thyself  and i will go out and
stand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will commune
with my father of thee and what i see that i will tell thee
and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said
unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david
because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have
been to theeward very good  for he did put his life in his hand
and slew the philistine and the lord wrought a great salvation for
all israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt
thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a cause
and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul sware as the
lord liveth he shall not be slain
and jonathan called david and jonathan shewed him all those
things
and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as in
times past
and there was war again and david went out and fought with the
philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled from
him
and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul as he sat in his
house with his javelin in his hand and david played with his hand
and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the
javelin but he slipped away out of sauls presence and he smote the
javelin into the wall and david fled and escaped that night
saul also sent messengers unto davids house to watch him and
to slay him in the morning and michal davids wife told him saying
if thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain
so michal let david down through a window and he went and
fled and escaped
and michal took an image and laid it in the bed and put a
pillow of goats hair for his bolster and covered it with a cloth
and when saul sent messengers to take david she said he is
sick
and saul sent the messengers again to see david saying bring
him up to me in the bed that i may slay him
and when the messengers were come in behold there was an image
in the bed with a pillow of goats hair for his bolster
and saul said unto michal why hast thou deceived me so and
sent away mine enemy that he is escaped and michal answered saul he
said unto me let me go why should i kill thee   so david fled
and escaped and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul
had done to him and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth
and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth in
ramah
and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw the
company of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as appointed
over them the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul and they
also prophesied
and when it was told saul he sent other messengers and they
prophesied likewise and saul sent messengers again the third time
and they prophesied also
then went he also to ramah and came to a great well that is in
sechu and he asked and said where are samuel and david and one
said behold they be at naioth in ramah
and he went thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god
was upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to
naioth in ramah
and he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before
samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that
night wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets   and
david fled from naioth in ramah and came and said before jonathan
what have i done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy
father that he seeketh my life   and he said unto him god
forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either
great or small but that he will shew it me and why should my father
hide this thing from me it is not so
and david sware moreover and said thy father certainly knoweth
that i have found grace in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathan
know this lest he be grieved but truly as the lord liveth and as
thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death
then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth i
will even do it for thee
and david said unto jonathan behold to morrow is the new moon
and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go
that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even
if thy father at all miss me then say david earnestly asked
leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for there is a
yearly sacrifice there for all the family
if he say thus it is well thy servant shall have peace but if
he be very wroth then be sure that evil is determined by him
therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast
brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee
notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why
shouldest thou bring me to thy father   and jonathan said far be
it from thee for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my
father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee   then
said david to jonathan who shall tell me or what if thy father
answer thee roughly   and jonathan said unto david come and
let us go out into the field and they went out both of them into the
field
and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have
sounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day and
behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee
and shew it thee  the lord do so and much more to jonathan but
if it please my father to do thee evil then i will shew it thee and
send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with
thee as he hath been with my father
and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew me the kindness of
the lord that i die not  but also thou shalt not cut off thy
kindness from my house for ever no not when the lord hath cut off
the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth
so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david saying let
the lord even require it at the hand of davids enemies
and jonathan caused david to swear again because he loved him
for he loved him as he loved his own soul
then jonathan said to david to morrow is the new moon and thou
shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty
and when thou hast stayed three days then thou shalt go down
quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the
business was in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel
and i will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though i
shot at a mark
and behold i will send a lad saying go find out the arrows
if i expressly say unto the lad behold the arrows are on this side
of thee take them then come thou for there is peace to thee and no
hurt as the lord liveth
but if i say thus unto the young man behold the arrows are
beyond thee go thy way for the lord hath sent thee away
and as touching the matter which thou and i have spoken of
behold the lord be between thee and me for ever
so david hid himself in the field and when the new moon was
come the king sat him down to eat meat
and the king sat upon his seat as at other times even upon a
seat by the wall and jonathan arose and abner sat by sauls side
and davids place was empty
nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day for he thought
something hath befallen him he is not clean surely he is not clean
and it came to pass on the morrow which was the second day of
the month that davids place was empty and saul said unto jonathan
his son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat neither
yesterday nor to day   and jonathan answered saul david
earnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem  and he said let
me go i pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city and
my brother he hath commanded me to be there and now if i have found
favour in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see my
brethren therefore he cometh not unto the kings table
then sauls anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto
him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know that
thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto the
confusion of thy mothers nakedness   for as long as the son of
jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy
kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely
die
and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him
wherefore shall he be slain what hath he done   and saul cast a
javelin at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it was
determined of his father to slay david
so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat no
meat the second day of the month for he was grieved for david
because his father had done him shame
and it came to pass in the morning that jonathan went out into
the field at the time appointed with david and a little lad with him
and he said unto his lad run find out now the arrows which i
shoot and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him
and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
jonathan had shot jonathan cried after the lad and said is not the
arrow beyond thee   and jonathan cried after the lad make
speed haste stay not and jonathans lad gathered up the arrows and
came to his master
but the lad knew not any thing only jonathan and david knew the
matter
and jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad and said unto him
go carry them to the city
and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of a place
toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed
himself three times and they kissed one another and wept one with
another until david exceeded
and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we have
sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be between
me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever and he arose
and departed and jonathan went into the city
then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech was
afraid at the meeting of david and said unto him why art thou alone
and no man with thee   and david said unto ahimelech the priest
the king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let no
man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee and what i
have commanded thee and i have appointed my servants to such and such
a place
now therefore what is under thine hand give me five loaves of
bread in mine hand or what there is present
and the priest answered david and said there is no common bread
under mine hand but there is hallowed bread if the young men have
kept themselves at least from women
and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth
women have been kept from us about these three days since i came out
and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a
manner common yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel
so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread
there but the shewbread that was taken from before the lord to put
hot bread in the day when it was taken away
now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day
detained before the lord and his name was doeg an edomite the
chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to saul
and david said unto ahimelech and is there not here under thine
hand spear or sword for i have neither brought my sword nor my
weapons with me because the kings business required haste
and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom
thou slewest in the valley of elah behold it is here wrapped in a
cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is
no other save that here and david said there is none like that give
it me
and david arose and fled that day for fear of saul and went to
achish the king of gath
and the servants of achish said unto him is not this david the
king of the land did they not sing one to another of him in dances
saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands
and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid
of achish the king of gath
and he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himself
mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let
his spittle fall down upon his beard
then said achish unto his servants lo ye see the man is mad
wherefore then have ye brought him to me   have i need of mad
men that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my
presence shall this fellow come into my house   david therefore
departed thence and escaped to the cave adullam and when his
brethren and all his fathers house heard it they went down thither
to him
and every one that was in distress and every one that was in
debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto
him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about
four hundred men
and david went thence to mizpeh of moab and he said unto the
king of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forth
and be with you till i know what god will do for me
and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt with
him all the while that david was in the hold
and the prophet gad said unto david abide not in the hold
depart and get thee into the land of judah then david departed and
came into the forest of hareth
when saul heard that david was discovered and the men that were
with him now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah having his
spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him
then saul said unto his servants that stood about him hear now ye
benjamites will the son of jesse give every one of you fields and
vineyards and make you all captains of thousands and captains of
hundreds  that all of you have conspired against me and there is
none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of
jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or sheweth unto
me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait
as at this day   then answered doeg the edomite which was set
over the servants of saul and said i saw the son of jesse coming to
nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub
and he enquired of the lord for him and gave him victuals and
gave him the sword of goliath the philistine
then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest the son of
ahitub and all his fathers house the priests that were in nob and
they came all of them to the king
and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub and he answered
here i am my lord
and saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou
and the son of jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a sword
and hast enquired of god for him that he should rise against me to
lie in wait as at this day   then ahimelech answered the king
and said and who is so faithful among all thy servants as david
which is the kings son in law and goeth at thy bidding and is
honourable in thine house   did i then begin to enquire of god
for him be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his
servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew
nothing of all this less or more
and the king said thou shalt surely die ahimelech thou and
all thy fathers house
and the king said unto the footmen that stood about him turn
and slay the priests of the lord because their hand also is with
david and because they knew when he fled and did not shew it to me
but the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall
upon the priests of the lord
and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priests
and doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on
that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod
and nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of the
sword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen and
asses and sheep with the edge of the sword
and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub named
abiathar escaped and fled after david
and abiathar shewed david that saul had slain the lords
priests
and david said unto abiathar i knew it that day when doeg the
edomite was there that he would surely tell saul i have occasioned
the death of all the persons of thy fathers house
abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life
seeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguard
then they told david saying behold the philistines fight
against keilah and they rob the threshingfloors
therefore david enquired of the lord saying shall i go and
smite these philistines and the lord said unto david go and smite
the philistines and save keilah
and davids men said unto him behold we be afraid here in
judah how much more then if we come to keilah against the armies of
the philistines   then david enquired of the lord yet again and
the lord answered him and said arise go down to keilah for i will
deliver the philistines into thine hand
so david and his men went to keilah and fought with the
philistines and brought away their cattle and smote them with a
great slaughter so david saved the inhabitants of keilah
and it came to pass when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to
david to keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand
and it was told saul that david was come to keilah and saul
said god hath delivered him into mine hand for he is shut in by
entering into a town that hath gates and bars
and saul called all the people together to war to go down to
keilah to besiege david and his men
and david knew that saul secretly practised mischief against him
and he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod
then said david o lord god of israel thy servant hath
certainly heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy the
city for my sake
will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand will saul
come down as thy servant hath heard o lord god of israel i beseech
thee tell thy servant and the lord said he will come down
then said david will the men of keilah deliver me and my men
into the hand of saul and the lord said they will deliver thee up
then david and his men which were about six hundred arose and
departed out of keilah and went whithersoever they could go and it
was told saul that david was escaped from keilah and he forbare to go
forth
and david abode in the wilderness in strong holds and remained
in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph and saul sought him every
day but god delivered him not into his hand
and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and david
was in the wilderness of ziph in a wood
and jonathan sauls son arose and went to david into the wood
and strengthened his hand in god
and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my father
shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall
be next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth
and they two made a covenant before the lord and david abode in
the wood and jonathan went to his house
then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah saying doth not
david hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood in the hill of
hachilah which is on the south of jeshimon   now therefore o
king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down
and our part shall be to deliver him into the kings hand
and saul said blessed be ye of the lord for ye have compassion
on me
go i pray you prepare yet and know and see his place where
his haunt is and who hath seen him there for it is told me that he
dealeth very subtilly
see therefore and take knowledge of all the lurking places
where he hideth himself and come ye again to me with the certainty
and i will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in the
land that i will search him out throughout all the thousands of
judah
and they arose and went to ziph before saul but david and his
men were in the wilderness of maon in the plain on the south of
jeshimon
saul also and his men went to seek him and they told david
wherefore he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness of
maon and when saul heard that he pursued after david in the
wilderness of maon
and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and his
men on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for
fear of saul for saul and his men compassed david and his men round
about to take them
but there came a messenger unto saul saying haste thee and
come for the philistines have invaded the land
wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went
against the philistines therefore they called that place
selahammahlekoth
and david went up from thence and dwelt in strong holds at
engedi
and it came to pass when saul was returned from following the
philistines that it was told him saying behold david is in the
wilderness of engedi
then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and
went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats
and he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave and
saul went in to cover his feet and david and his men remained in the
sides of the cave
and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the
lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thine
hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then
david arose and cut off the skirt of sauls robe privily
and it came to pass afterward that davids heart smote him
because he had cut off sauls skirt
and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this
thing unto my master the lords anointed to stretch forth mine hand
against him seeing he is the anointed of the lord
so david stayed his servants with these words and suffered them
not to rise against saul but saul rose up out of the cave and went
on his way
david also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried
after saul saying my lord the king and when saul looked behind him
david stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself
and david said to saul wherefore hearest thou mens words
saying behold david seeketh thy hurt   behold this day thine
eyes have seen how that the lord had delivered thee to day into mine
hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye spared
thee and i said i will not put forth mine hand against my lord for
he is the lords anointed
moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my
hand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee
not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in
mine hand and i have not sinned against thee yet thou huntest my
soul to take it
the lord judge between me and thee and the lord avenge me of
thee but mine hand shall not be upon thee
as saith the proverb of the ancients wickedness proceedeth from
the wicked but mine hand shall not be upon thee
after whom is the king of israel come out after whom dost thou
pursue after a dead dog after a flea
the lord therefore be judge and judge between me and thee and
see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thine hand
and it came to pass when david had made an end of speaking
these words unto saul that saul said is this thy voice my son
david and saul lifted up his voice and wept
and he said to david thou art more righteous than i for thou
hast rewarded me good whereas i have rewarded thee evil
and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with
me forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me into thine hand thou
killedst me not
for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away
wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me
this day
and now behold i know well that thou shalt surely be king and
that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand
swear now therefore unto me by the lord that thou wilt not cut
off my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my
fathers house
and david sware unto saul and saul went home but david and his
men gat them up unto the hold
and samuel died and all the israelites were gathered together
and lamented him and buried him in his house at ramah and david
arose and went down to the wilderness of paran
and there was a man in maon whose possessions were in carmel
and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a
thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel
now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife
abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful
countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he
was of the house of caleb
and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did shear his sheep
and david sent out ten young men and david said unto the young
men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name
and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity peace be
both to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that
thou hast
and now i have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherds
which were with us we hurt them not neither was there ought missing
unto them all the while they were in carmel
ask thy young men and they will shew thee wherefore let the
young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give
i pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to
thy son david
and when davids young men came they spake to nabal according to
all those words in the name of david and ceased
and nabal answered davids servants and said who is david and
who is the son of jesse there be many servants now a days that break
away every man from his master
shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i
have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know not
whence they be   so davids young men turned their way and went
again and came and told him all those sayings
and david said unto his men gird ye on every man his sword and
they girded on every man his sword and david also girded on his
sword and there went up after david about four hundred men and two
hundred abode by the stuff
but one of the young men told abigail nabals wife saying
behold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our
master and he railed on them
but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt
neither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with them
when we were in the fields  they were a wall unto us both by
night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep
now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is
determined against our master and against all his household for he
is such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him
then abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two
bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of
parched corn and an hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred
cakes of figs and laid them on asses
and she said unto her servants go on before me behold i come
after you but she told not her husband nabal
and it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down by the
covert on the hill and behold david and his men came down against
her and she met them
now david had said surely in vain have i kept all that this
fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that
pertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for good
so and more also do god unto the enemies of david if i leave of
all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against
the wall
and when abigail saw david she hasted and lighted off the ass
and fell before david on her face and bowed herself to the ground
and fell at his feet and said upon me my lord upon me let
this iniquity be and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in thine
audience and hear the words of thine handmaid
let not my lord i pray thee regard this man of belial even
nabal for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly is
with him but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom
thou didst send
now therefore my lord as the lord liveth and as thy soul
liveth seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed
blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine
enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as nabal
and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my
lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord
i pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the
lord will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord
fighteth the battles of the lord and evil hath not been found in thee
all thy days
yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the
soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy
god and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out
of the middle of a sling
and it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done to my
lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee
and shall have appointed thee ruler over israel  that this shall
be no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that
thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath avenged himself
but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then remember
thine handmaid
and david said to abigail blessed be the lord god of israel
which sent thee this day to meet me  and blessed be thy advice
and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shed
blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand
for in very deed as the lord god of israel liveth which hath
kept me back from hurting thee except thou hadst hasted and come to
meet me surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morning
light any that pisseth against the wall
so david received of her hand that which she had brought him
and said unto her go up in peace to thine house see i have
hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person
and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in his
house like the feast of a king and nabals heart was merry within
him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or
more until the morning light
but it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out
of nabal and his wife had told him these things that his heart died
within him and he became as a stone
and it came to pass about ten days after that the lord smote
nabal that he died
and when david heard that nabal was dead he said blessed be
the lord that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of
nabal and hath kept his servant from evil for the lord hath returned
the wickedness of nabal upon his own head and david sent and communed
with abigail to take her to him to wife
and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmel
they spake unto her saying david sent us unto thee to take thee to
him to wife
and she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth and
said behold let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the
servants of my lord
and abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with five
damsels of hers that went after her and she went after the messengers
of david and became his wife
david also took ahinoam of jezreel and they were also both of
them his wives
but saul had given michal his daughter davids wife to phalti
the son of laish which was of gallim
and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah saying doth not david
hide himself in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon
then saul arose and went down to the wilderness of ziph having three
thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the
wilderness of ziph
and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah which is before
jeshimon by the way but david abode in the wilderness and he saw
that saul came after him into the wilderness
david therefore sent out spies and understood that saul was come
in very deed
and david arose and came to the place where saul had pitched
and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner
the captain of his host and saul lay in the trench and the people
pitched round about him
then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite and to
abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab saying who will go down
with me to saul to the camp and abishai said i will go down with
thee
so david and abishai came to the people by night and behold
saul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground
at his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him
then said abishai to david god hath delivered thine enemy into
thine hand this day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee with
the spear even to the earth at once and i will not smite him the
second time
and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch
forth his hand against the lords anointed and be guiltless
david said furthermore as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him
or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and
perish
the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against
the lords anointed but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is
at his bolster and the cruse of water and let us go
so david took the spear and the cruse of water from sauls
bolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it
neither awaked for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from
the lord was fallen upon them
then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of
an hill afar off a great space being between them  and david
cried to the people and to abner the son of ner saying answerest
thou not abner then abner answered and said who art thou that
criest to the king   and david said to abner art not thou a
valiant man and who is like to thee in israel wherefore then hast
thou not kept thy lord the king for there came one of the people in
to destroy the king thy lord
this thing is not good that thou hast done as the lord liveth
ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept your master the lords
anointed
and now see where the kings spear is and the cruse of water that was
at his bolster
and saul knew davids voice and said is this thy voice my son
david and david said it is my voice my lord o king
and he said wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
servant  for what have i done or what evil is in mine hand
now therefore i pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of his
servant if the lord have stirred thee up against me let him accept
an offering but if they be the children of men cursed be they before
the lord for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the
inheritance of the lord saying go serve other gods
now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the
face of the lord for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea
as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains
then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i will
no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes this
day behold i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly
and david answered and said behold the kings spear and let
one of the young men come over and fetch it
the lord render to every man his righteousness and his
faithfulness for the lord delivered thee into my hand to day but i
would not stretch forth mine hand against the lords anointed
and behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes
so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord and let him
deliver me out of all tribulation
then saul said to david blessed be thou my son david thou
shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail so david
went on his way and saul returned to his place
and david said in his heart i shall now perish one day by the
hand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i should
speedily escape into the land of the philistines and saul shall
despair of me to seek me any more in any coast of israel so shall i
escape out of his hand
and david arose and he passed over with the six hundred men that
were with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath
and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every man
with his household even david with his two wives ahinoam the
jezreelitess and abigail the carmelitess nabals wife
and it was told saul that david was fled to gath and he sought
no more again for him
and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thine
eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that i may
dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with
thee   then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag
pertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day
and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistines
was a full year and four months
and david and his men went up and invaded the geshurites and
the gezrites and the amalekites for those nations were of old the
inhabitants of the land as thou goest to shur even unto the land of
egypt
and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive
and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels
and the apparel and returned and came to achish
and achish said whither have ye made a road to day and david
said against the south of judah and against the south of the
jerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites
and david saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to
gath saying lest they should tell on us saying so did david and
so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the
philistines
and achish believed david saying he hath made his people
israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for
ever
and it came to pass in those days that the philistines gathered
their armies together for warfare to fight with israel and achish
said unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me
to battle thou and thy men
and david said to achish surely thou shalt know what thy servant
can do and achish said to david therefore will i make thee keeper of
mine head for ever
now samuel was dead and all israel had lamented him and buried
him in ramah even in his own city and saul had put away those that
had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land
and the philistines gathered themselves together and came and
pitched in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and they
pitched in gilboa
and when saul saw the host of the philistines he was afraid and
his heart greatly trembled
and when saul enquired of the lord the lord answered him not
neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets
then said saul unto his servants seek me a woman that hath a
familiar spirit that i may go to her and enquire of her and his
servants said to him behold there is a woman that hath a familiar
spirit at endor
and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and he
went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and
he said i pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bring
me him up whom i shall name unto thee
and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath
done how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits and the
wizards out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my
life to cause me to die   and saul sware to her by the lord
saying as the lord liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee
for this thing
then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee and he
said bring me up samuel
and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and
the woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me for thou
art saul
and the king said unto her be not afraid for what sawest thou
and the woman said unto saul i saw gods ascending out of the earth
and he said unto her what form is he of and she said an old
man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle and saul perceived
that it was samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and
bowed himself
and samuel said to saul why hast thou disquieted me to bring
me up and saul answered i am sore distressed for the philistines
make war against me and god is departed from me and answereth me no
more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have called
thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do
then said samuel wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing the
lord is departed from thee and is become thine enemy   and the
lord hath done to him as he spake by me for the lord hath rent the
kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even to
david  because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord nor
executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord done
this thing unto thee this day
moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the
hand of the philistines and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with
me the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of
the philistines
then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and was sore
afraid because of the words of samuel and there was no strength in
him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night
and the woman came unto saul and saw that he was sore troubled
and said unto him behold thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice and i
have put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which
thou spakest unto me
now therefore i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of
thine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eat
that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way
but he refused and said i will not eat but his servants
together with the woman compelled him and he hearkened unto their
voice so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed
and the woman had a fat calf in the house and she hasted and
killed it and took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavened
bread thereof  and she brought it before saul and before his
servants and they did eat then they rose up and went away that
night
now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphek
and the israelites pitched by a fountain which is in jezreel
and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds and by
thousands but david and his men passed on in the rereward with
achish
then said the princes of the philistines what do these hebrews
here  and achish said unto the princes of the philistines is not
this david the servant of saul the king of israel which hath been
with me these days or these years and i have found no fault in him
since he fell unto me unto this day   and the princes of the
philistines were wroth with him and the princes of the philistines
said unto him make this fellow return that he may go again to his
place which thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with us
to battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us for wherewith
should he reconcile himself unto his master should it not be with the
heads of these men   is not this david of whom they sang one to
another in dances saying saul slew his thousands and david his ten
thousands   then achish called david and said unto him surely
as the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thy
coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for i have not
found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day
nevertheless the lords favour thee not
wherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease not
the lords of the philistines
and david said unto achish but what have i done and what hast
thou found in thy servant so long as i have been with thee unto this
day that i may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king
and achish answered and said to david i know that thou art good
in my sight as an angel of god notwithstanding the princes of the
philistines have said he shall not go up with us to the battle
wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy masters
servants that are come with thee and as soon as ye be up early in the
morning and have light depart
so david and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to
return into the land of the philistines and the philistines went up
to jezreel
and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag
on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and
ziklag and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire  and had
taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either
great or small but carried them away and went on their way
so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned
with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were
taken captives
then david and the people that were with him lifted up their
voice and wept until they had no more power to weep
and davids two wives were taken captives ahinoam the
jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite
and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning
him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his
sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord
his god
and david said to abiathar the priest ahimelechs son i pray
thee bring me hither the ephod and abiathar brought thither the
ephod to david
and david enquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this
troop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou
shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all
so david went he and the six hundred men that were with him and
came to the brook besor where those that were left behind stayed
but david pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred
abode behind which were so faint that they could not go over the
brook besor
and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to
david and gave him bread and he did eat and they made him drink
water  and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two
clusters of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came again to
him for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and
three nights
and david said unto him to whom belongest thou and whence art
thou and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekite
and my master left me because three days agone i fell sick
we made an invasion upon the south of the cherethites and upon
the coast which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb and
we burned ziklag with fire
and david said to him canst thou bring me down to this company
and he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor
deliver me into the hands of my master and i will bring thee down to
this company
and when he had brought him down behold they were spread
abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing because
of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the
philistines and out of the land of judah
and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of
the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred
young men which rode upon camels and fled
and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away
and david rescued his two wives
and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great
neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor any thing that they had
taken to them david recovered all
and david took all the flocks and the herds which they drave
before those other cattle and said this is davids spoil
and david came to the two hundred men which were so faint that
they could not follow david whom they had made also to abide at the
brook besor and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people
that were with him and when david came near to the people he saluted
them
then answered all the wicked men and men of belial of those
that went with david and said because they went not with us we will
not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every
man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and
depart
then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with that
which the lord hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered the
company that came against us into our hand
for who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part is
that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth by
the stuff they shall part alike
and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute
and an ordinance for israel unto this day
and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the
elders of judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you
of the spoil of the enemies of the lord  to them which were in
bethel and to them which were in south ramoth and to them which were
in jattir  and to them which were in aroer and to them which
were in siphmoth and to them which were in eshtemoa  and to
them which were in rachal and to them which were in the cities of the
jerahmeelites and to them which were in the cities of the kenites
and to them which were in hormah and to them which were in
chorashan and to them which were in athach  and to them which
were in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his men
were wont to haunt
now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel
fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa
and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sons
and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and melchishua
sauls sons
and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him
and he was sore wounded of the archers
then said saul unto his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust
me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me
through and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore
afraid therefore saul took a sword and fell upon it
and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell
likewise upon his sword and died with him
so saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all
his men that same day together
and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the
valley and they that were on the other side jordan saw that the men
of israel fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook the
cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them
and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to
strip the slain that they found saul and his three sons fallen in
mount gilboa
and they cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sent
into the land of the philistines round about to publish it in the
house of their idols and among the people
and they put his armour in the house of ashtaroth and they
fastened his body to the wall of bethshan
and when the inhabitants of jabeshgilead heard of that which the
philistines had done to saul  all the valiant men arose and
went all night and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sons
from the wall of bethshan and came to jabesh and burnt them there
and they took their bones and buried them under a tree at
jabesh and fasted seven days
the second book of samuel
otherwise called
the second book of the kings
now it came to pass after the death of saul when david was
returned from the slaughter of the amalekites and david had abode two
days in ziklag  it came even to pass on the third day that
behold a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rent
and earth upon his head and so it was when he came to david that he
fell to the earth and did obeisance
and david said unto him from whence comest thou and he said unto
him out of the camp of israel am i escaped
and david said unto him how went the matter i pray thee tell
me
and he answered that the people are fled from the battle and many of
the people also are fallen and dead and saul and jonathan his son are
dead also
and david said unto the young man that told him how knowest thou
that saul and jonathan his son be dead   and the young man that
told him said as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa behold saul
leaned upon his spear and lo the chariots and horsemen followed
hard after him
and when he looked behind him he saw me and called unto me and
i answered here am i
and he said unto me who art thou and i answered him i am an
amalekite
he said unto me again stand i pray thee upon me and slay me
for anguish is come upon me because my life is yet whole in me
so i stood upon him and slew him because i was sure that he
could not live after that he was fallen and i took the crown that was
upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought
them hither unto my lord
then david took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise
all the men that were with him  and they mourned and wept and
fasted until even for saul and for jonathan his son and for the
people of the lord and for the house of israel because they were
fallen by the sword
and david said unto the young man that told him whence art thou
and he answered i am the son of a stranger an amalekite
and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to stretch
forth thine hand to destroy the lords anointed   and david
called one of the young men and said go near and fall upon him and
he smote him that he died
and david said unto him thy blood be upon thy head for thy
mouth hath testified against thee saying i have slain the lords
anointed
and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over
jonathan his son  also he bade them teach the children of judah
the use of the bow behold it is written in the book of jasher
the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places how are the
mighty fallen   tell it not in gath publish it not in the
streets of askelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice
lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph
ye mountains of gilboa let there be no dew neither let there be
rain upon you nor fields of offerings for there the shield of the
mighty is vilely cast away the shield of saul as though he had not
been anointed with oil
from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow
of jonathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty
saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in
their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they
were stronger than lions
ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in
scarlet with other delights who put on ornaments of gold upon your
apparel
how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle o jonathan
thou wast slain in thine high places
i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast
thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of
women
how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished
and it came to pass after this that david enquired of the lord
saying shall i go up into any of the cities of judah and the lord
said unto him go up and david said whither shall i go up and he
said unto hebron
so david went up thither and his two wives also ahinoam the
jezreelitess and abigail nabals wife the carmelite
and his men that were with him did david bring up every man with
his household and they dwelt in the cities of hebron
and the men of judah came and there they anointed david king over
the house of judah and they told david saying that the men of
jabeshgilead were they that buried saul
and david sent messengers unto the men of jabeshgilead and said
unto them blessed be ye of the lord that ye have shewed this
kindness unto your lord even unto saul and have buried him
and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you and i also will
requite you this kindness because ye have done this thing
therefore now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant
for your master saul is dead and also the house of judah have
anointed me king over them
but abner the son of ner captain of sauls host took ishbosheth
the son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim  and made him
king over gilead and over the ashurites and over jezreel and over
ephraim and over benjamin and over all israel
ishbosheth sauls son was forty years old when he began to reign
over israel and reigned two years but the house of judah followed
david
and the time that david was king in hebron over the house of
judah was seven years and six months
and abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the son
of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon
and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out
and met together by the pool of gibeon and they sat down the one on
the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool
and abner said to joab let the young men now arise and play
before us and joab said let them arise
then there arose and went over by number twelve of benjamin
which pertained to ishbosheth the son of saul and twelve of the
servants of david
and they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his
sword in his fellows side so they fell down together wherefore that
place was called helkathhazzurim which is in gibeon
and there was a very sore battle that day and abner was beaten
and the men of israel before the servants of david
and there were three sons of zeruiah there joab and abishai
and asahel and asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe
and asahel pursued after abner and in going he turned not to the
right hand nor to the left from following abner
then abner looked behind him and said art thou asahel and he
answered i am
and abner said to him turn thee aside to thy right hand or to
thy left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his
armour
but asahel would not turn aside from following of him
and abner said again to asahel turn thee aside from following
me wherefore should i smite thee to the ground how then should i
hold up my face to joab thy brother   howbeit he refused to turn
aside wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him
under the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him and he fell
down there and died in the same place and it came to pass that as
many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still
joab also and abishai pursued after abner and the sun went down
when they were come to the hill of ammah that lieth before giah by
the way of the wilderness of gibeon
and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after
abner and became one troop and stood on the top of an hill
then abner called to joab and said shall the sword devour for
ever  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end
how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from
following their brethren   and joab said as god liveth unless
thou hadst spoken surely then in the morning the people had gone up
every one from following his brother
so joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood still and
pursued after israel no more neither fought they any more
and abner and his men walked all that night through the plain
and passed over jordan and went through all bithron and they came to
mahanaim
and joab returned from following abner and when he had gathered
all the people together there lacked of davids servants nineteen men
and asahel
but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin and of abners
men so that three hundred and threescore men died
and they took up asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his
father which was in bethlehem and joab and his men went all night
and they came to hebron at break of day
now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of
david but david waxed stronger and stronger and the house of saul
waxed weaker and weaker
and unto david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn was
amnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess  and his second chileab of
abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the
son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur  and the
fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son
of abital  and the sixth ithream by eglah davids wife these
were born to david in hebron
and it came to pass while there was war between the house of saul
and the house of david that abner made himself strong for the house
of saul
and saul had a concubine whose name was rizpah the daughter of
aiah and ishbosheth said to abner wherefore hast thou gone in unto
my fathers concubine   then was abner very wroth for the words of
ishbosheth and said am i a dogs head which against judah do shew
kindness this day unto the house of saul thy father to his brethren
and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of
david that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this
woman   so do god to abner and more also except as the lord
hath sworn to david even so i do to him  to translate the
kingdom from the house of saul and to set up the throne of david over
israel and over judah from dan even to beersheba
and he could not answer abner a word again because he feared
him
and abner sent messengers to david on his behalf saying whose
is the land saying also make thy league with me and behold my
hand shall be with thee to bring about all israel unto thee
and he said well i will make a league with thee but one thing
i require of thee that is thou shalt not see my face except thou
first bring michal sauls daughter when thou comest to see my face
and david sent messengers to ishbosheth sauls son saying
deliver me my wife michal which i espoused to me for an hundred
foreskins of the philistines
and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from
phaltiel the son of laish
and her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
bahurim
then said abner unto him go return and he returned
and abner had communication with the elders of israel saying ye
sought for david in times past to be king over you  now then do
it for the lord hath spoken of david saying by the hand of my
servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the
philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies
and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin and abner went also
to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to
israel and that seemed good to the whole house of benjamin
so abner came to david to hebron and twenty men with him and
david made abner and the men that were with him a feast
and abner said unto david i will arise and go and will gather
all israel unto my lord the king that they may make a league with
thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth
and david sent abner away and he went in peace
and behold the servants of david and joab came from pursuing a
troop and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not with
david in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace
when joab and all the host that was with him were come they told
joab saying abner the son of ner came to the king and he hath sent
him away and he is gone in peace
then joab came to the king and said what hast thou done
behold abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him away
and he is quite gone   thou knowest abner the son of ner that he
came to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in and
to know all that thou doest
and when joab was come out from david he sent messengers after
abner which brought him again from the well of sirah but david knew
it not
and when abner was returned to hebron joab took him aside in the
gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth
rib that he died for the blood of asahel his brother
and afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom are
guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of
ner  let it rest on the head of joab and on all his fathers
house and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an
issue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth
on the sword or that lacketh bread
so joab and abishai his brother slew abner because he had slain
their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle
and david said to joab and to all the people that were with him
rend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and mourn before
abner and king david himself followed the bier
and they buried abner in hebron and the king lifted up his
voice and wept at the grave of abner and all the people wept
and the king lamented over abner and said died abner as a fool
dieth   thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters
as a man falleth before wicked men so fellest thou and all the
people wept again over him
and when all the people came to cause david to eat meat while it
was yet day david sware saying so do god to me and more also if i
taste bread or ought else till the sun be down
and all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as
whatsoever the king did pleased all the people
for all the people and all israel understood that day that it was
not of the king to slay abner the son of ner
and the king said unto his servants know ye not that there is a
prince and a great man fallen this day in israel   and i am this
day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of zeruiah be
too hard for me the lord shall reward the doer of evil according to
his wickedness
and when sauls son heard that abner was dead in hebron his hands
were feeble and all the israelites were troubled
and sauls son had two men that were captains of bands the name
of the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons of
rimmon a beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth also
was reckoned to benjamin
and the beerothites fled to gittaim and were sojourners there
until this day   and jonathan sauls son had a son that was
lame of his feet he was five years old when the tidings came of saul
and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and
it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became
lame and his name was mephibosheth
and the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah went
and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth who lay
on a bed at noon
and they came thither into the midst of the house as though they
would have fetched wheat and they smote him under the fifth rib and
rechab and baanah his brother escaped
for when they came into the house he lay on his bed in his
bedchamber and they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and
took his head and gat them away through the plain all night
and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron and
said to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine
enemy which sought thy life and the lord hath avenged my lord the
king this day of saul and of his seed
and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of
rimmon the beerothite and said unto them as the lord liveth who
hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity  when one told me
saying behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings i
took hold of him and slew him in ziklag who thought that i would
have given him a reward for his tidings  how much more when
wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his
bed shall i not therefore now require his blood of your hand and
take you away from the earth   and david commanded his young men
and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged
them up over the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishbosheth
and buried it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron
then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron and
spake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh
also in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he that
leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said to thee thou
shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel
so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and king
david made a league with them in hebron before the lord and they
anointed david king over israel
david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned
forty years
in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in
jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah
and the king and his men went to jerusalem unto the jebusites the
inhabitants of the land which spake unto david saying except thou
take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither
thinking david cannot come in hither
nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion the same is the
city of david
and david said on that day whosoever getteth up to the gutter
and smiteth the jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated
of davids soul he shall be chief and captain wherefore they said
the blind and the lame shall not come into the house
so david dwelt in the fort and called it the city of david and
david built round about from millo and inward
and david went on and grew great and the lord god of hosts was
with him
and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees
and carpenters and masons and they built david an house
and david perceived that the lord had established him king over
israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israels
sake
and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem
after he was come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughters
born to david
and these be the names of those that were born unto him in
jerusalem shammuah and shobab and nathan and solomon  ibhar
also and elishua and nepheg and japhia  and elishama and
eliada and eliphalet
but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king
over israel all the philistines came up to seek david and david
heard of it and went down to the hold
the philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of
rephaim
and david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up to the
philistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said
unto david go up for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into
thine hand
and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and
said the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the
breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place
baalperazim
and there they left their images and david and his men burned
them
and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in
the valley of rephaim
and when david enquired of the lord he said thou shalt not go
up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against
the mulberry trees
and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops
of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then
shall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of the
philistines
and david did so as the lord had commanded him and smote the
philistines from geba until thou come to gazer
again david gathered together all the chosen men of israel
thirty thousand
and david arose and went with all the people that were with him
from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god whose
name is called by the name of the lord of hosts that dwelleth between
the cherubims
and they set the ark of god upon a new cart and brought it out of
the house of abinadab that was in gibeah and uzzah and ahio the sons
of abinadab drave the new cart
and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at
gibeah accompanying the ark of god and ahio went before the ark
and david and all the house of israel played before the lord on
all manner of instruments made of fir wood even on harps and on
psalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbals
and when they came to nachons threshingfloor uzzah put forth his
hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen shook it
and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah and god smote
him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god
and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon
uzzah and he called the name of the place perezuzzah to this day
and david was afraid of the lord that day and said how shall the
ark of the lord come to me   so david would not remove the ark of
the lord unto him into the city of david but david carried it aside
into the house of obededom the gittite
and the ark of the lord continued in the house of obededom the
gittite three months and the lord blessed obededom and all his
household
and it was told king david saying the lord hath blessed the
house of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the
ark of god so david went and brought up the ark of god from the house
of obededom into the city of david with gladness
and it was so that when they that bare the ark of the lord had
gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings
and david danced before the lord with all his might and david
was girded with a linen ephod
so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the
lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet
and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michal
sauls daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping
and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart
and they brought in the ark of the lord and set it in his place
in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it and
david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord
and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings
and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of
hosts
and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude
of israel as well to the women as men to every one a cake of bread
and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine so all the people
departed every one to his house
then david returned to bless his household and michal the
daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious was
the king of israel to day who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of
the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly
uncovereth himself   and david said unto michal it was before
the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house
to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel
therefore will i play before the lord
and i will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in mine
own sight and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of of them
shall i be had in honour
therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day
of her death
and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lord
had given him rest round about from all his enemies  that the king
said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in an house of cedar
but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains
and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart
for the lord is with thee
and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord came
unto nathan saying  go and tell my servant david thus saith the
lord shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in   whereas i
have not dwelt in any house since the time that i brought up the
children of israel out of egypt even to this day but have walked in
a tent and in a tabernacle
in all the places wherein i have walked with all the children of
israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel whom i
commanded to feed my people israel saying why build ye not me an
house of cedar   now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant
david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote
from following the sheep to be ruler over my people over israel
and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all
thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like
unto the name of the great men that are in the earth
moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel and will
plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no
more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more
as beforetime  and as since the time that i commanded judges to
be over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine
enemies also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house
and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy
fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of
thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom
he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the
throne of his kingdom for ever
i will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit
iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes
of the children of men  but my mercy shall not depart away from
him as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee
and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
before thee thy throne shall be established for ever
according to all these words and according to all this vision
so did nathan speak unto david
then went king david in and sat before the lord and he said
who am i o lord god and what is my house that thou hast brought me
hitherto   and this was yet a small thing in thy sight o lord
god but thou hast spoken also of thy servants house for a great
while to come and is this the manner of man o lord god   and
what can david say more unto thee for thou lord god knowest thy
servant
for thy words sake and according to thine own heart hast thou
done all these great things to make thy servant know them
wherefore thou art great o lord god for there is none like
thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we
have heard with our ears
and what one nation in the earth is like thy people even like
israel whom god went to redeem for a people to himself and to make
him a name and to do for you great things and terrible for thy land
before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt from the
nations and their gods   for thou hast confirmed to thyself thy
people israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou lord art
become their god
and now o lord god the word that thou hast spoken concerning
thy servant and concerning his house establish it for ever and do
as thou hast said
and let thy name be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts
is the god over israel and let the house of thy servant david be
established before thee
for thou o lord of hosts god of israel hast revealed to thy
servant saying i will build thee an house therefore hath thy
servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee
and now o lord god thou art that god and thy words be true
and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant  therefore
now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may
continue for ever before thee for thou o lord god hast spoken it
and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for
ever
and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines
and subdued them and david took methegammah out of the hand of the
philistines
and he smote moab and measured them with a line casting them
down to the ground even with two lines measured he to put to death
and with one full line to keep alive and so the moabites became
davids servants and brought gifts
david smote also hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah as he
went to recover his border at the river euphrates
and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven hundred
horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david houghed all the
chariot horses but reserved of them for an hundred chariots
and when the syrians of damascus came to succour hadadezer king of
zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men
then david put garrisons in syria of damascus and the syrians
became servants to david and brought gifts and the lord preserved
david whithersoever he went
and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
hadadezer and brought them to jerusalem
and from betah and from berothai cities of hadadezer king david
took exceeding much brass
when toi king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host
of hadadezer  then toi sent joram his son unto king david to
salute him and to bless him because he had fought against hadadezer
and smitten him for hadadezer had wars with toi and joram brought
with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass
which also king david did dedicate unto the lord with the silver
and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued
of syria and of moab and of the children of ammon and of the
philistines and of amalek and of the spoil of hadadezer son of
rehob king of zobah
and david gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
syrians in the valley of salt being eighteen thousand men
and he put garrisons in edom throughout all edom put he
garrisons and all they of edom became davids servants and the lord
preserved david whithersoever he went
and david reigned over all israel and david executed judgment
and justice unto all his people
and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat
the son of ahilud was recorder  and zadok the son of ahitub and
ahimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and seraiah was the
scribe  and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over both the
cherethites and the pelethites and davids sons were chief rulers
and david said is there yet any that is left of the house of
saul that i may shew him kindness for jonathans sake   and there
was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba and when they
had called him unto david the king said unto him art thou ziba  and
he said thy servant is he
and the king said is there not yet any of the house of saul that
i may shew the kindness of god unto him and ziba said unto the king
jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet
and the king said unto him where is he and ziba said unto the
king behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in
lodebar
then king david sent and fetched him out of the house of machir
the son of ammiel from lodebar
now when mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul was
come unto david he fell on his face and did reverence and david
said mephibosheth and he answered behold thy servant   and
david said unto him fear not for i will surely shew thee kindness
for jonathan thy fathers sake and will restore thee all the land of
saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually
and he bowed himself and said what is thy servant that thou
shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am   then the king called
to ziba sauls servant and said unto him i have given unto thy
masters son all that pertained to saul and to all his house
thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the
land for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy masters
son may have food to eat but mephibosheth thy masters son shall eat
bread alway at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty
servants
then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord the
king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do as for
mephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the
kings sons
and mephibosheth had a young son whose name was micha and all
that dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth
so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually at
the kings table and was lame on both his feet
and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of
ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead
then said david i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of
nahash as his father shewed kindness unto me and david sent to
comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father and davids
servants came into the land of the children of ammon
and the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their
lord thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath
sent comforters unto thee hath not david rather sent his servants
unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it
wherefore hanun took davids servants and shaved off the one
half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even
to their buttocks and sent them away
when they told it unto david he sent to meet them because the
men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until
your beards be grown and then return
and when the children of ammon saw that they stank before david
the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of bethrehob and the
syrians of zoba twenty thousand footmen and of king maacah a
thousand men and of ishtob twelve thousand men
and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the
mighty men
and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array
at the entering in of the gate and the syrians of zoba and of rehob
and ishtob and maacah were by themselves in the field
when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before
and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in
array against the syrians  and the rest of the people he
delivered into the hand of abishai his brother that he might put them
in array against the children of ammon
and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou
shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee
then i will come and help thee
be of good courage and let us play the men for our people and
for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seemeth him
good
and joab drew nigh and the people that were with him unto the
battle against the syrians and they fled before him
and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled
then fled they also before abishai and entered into the city so joab
returned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem
and when the syrians saw that they were smitten before israel
they gathered themselves together
and hadarezer sent and brought out the syrians that were beyond
the river and they came to helam and shobach the captain of the host
of hadarezer went before them
and when it was told david he gathered all israel together and
passed over jordan and came to helam and the syrians set themselves
in array against david and fought with him
and the syrians fled before israel and david slew the men of
seven hundred chariots of the syrians and forty thousand horsemen
and smote shobach the captain of their host who died there
and when all the kings that were servants to hadarezer saw that
they were smitten before israel they made peace with israel and
served them so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any
more
and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when
kings go forth to battle that david sent joab and his servants with
him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and
besieged rabbah but david tarried still at jerusalem
and it came to pass in an eveningtide that david arose from off
his bed and walked upon the roof of the kings house and from the
roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful
to look upon
and david sent and enquired after the woman and one said is not
this bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite
and david sent messengers and took her and she came in unto
him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness
and she returned unto her house
and the woman conceived and sent and told david and said i am
with child
and david sent to joab saying send me uriah the hittite and
joab sent uriah to david
and when uriah was come unto him david demanded of him how joab
did and how the people did and how the war prospered
and david said to uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet
and uriah departed out of the kings house and there followed him a
mess of meat from the king
but uriah slept at the door of the kings house with all the
servants of his lord and went not down to his house
and when they had told david saying uriah went not down unto
his house david said unto uriah camest thou not from thy journey
why then didst thou not go down unto thine house   and uriah
said unto david the ark and israel and judah abide in tents and
my lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open
fields shall i then go into mine house to eat and to drink and to
lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will not
do this thing
and david said to uriah tarry here to day also and to morrow i
will let thee depart so uriah abode in jerusalem that day and the
morrow
and when david had called him he did eat and drink before him
and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with
the servants of his lord but went not down to his house
and it came to pass in the morning that david wrote a letter to
joab and sent it by the hand of uriah
and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in the
forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may
be smitten and die
and it came to pass when joab observed the city that he
assigned uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were
and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and
there fell some of the people of the servants of david and uriah the
hittite died also
then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war
and charged the messenger saying when thou hast made an end of
telling the matters of the war unto the king  and if so be that
the kings wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore approached ye
so nigh unto the city when ye did fight knew ye not that they would
shoot from the wall   who smote abimelech the son of
jerubbesheth did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him
from the wall that he died in thebez why went ye nigh the wall then
say thou thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also
so the messenger went and came and shewed david all that joab
had sent him for
and the messenger said unto david surely the men prevailed
against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them
even unto the entering of the gate
and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants and
some of the kings servants be dead and thy servant uriah the hittite
is dead also
then david said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto
joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one
as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city and
overthrow it and encourage thou him
and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was
dead she mourned for her husband
and when the mourning was past david sent and fetched her to
his house and she became his wife and bare him a son but the thing
that david had done displeased the lord
and the lord sent nathan unto david and he came unto him and
said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the
other poor
the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds  but the
poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought
and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his
children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and
lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter
and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to
take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring
man that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressed
it for the man that was come to him
and davids anger was greatly kindled against the man and he
said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing
shall surely die  and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because
he did this thing and because he had no pity
and nathan said to david thou art the man thus saith the lord
god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered thee
out of the hand of saul  and i gave thee thy masters house and
thy masters wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel
and of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover have
given unto thee such and such things
wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord to do
evil in his sight thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the sword
and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the
sword of the children of ammon
now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house
because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah the
hittite to be thy wife
thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee
out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes
and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives in
the sight of this sun
for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all
israel and before the sun
and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and
nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou
shalt not die
howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to
the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto
thee shall surely die
and nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck the
child that uriahs wife bare unto david and it was very sick
david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted
and went in and lay all night upon the earth
and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him
up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with
them
and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and
the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for
they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him
and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself
if we tell him that the child is dead   but when david saw that
his servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead
therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and they
said he is dead
then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed
himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord
and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required
they set bread before him and he did eat
then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou
hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive
but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread
and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept
for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the
child may live   but now he is dead wherefore should i fast
can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return
to me
and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in unto her
and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name solomon
and the lord loved him
and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called his
name jedidiah because of the lord
and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and
took the royal city
and joab sent messengers to david and said i have fought
against rabbah and have taken the city of waters
now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp
against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called
after my name
and david gathered all the people together and went to rabbah
and fought against it and took it
and he took their kings crown from off his head the weight
whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set
on davids head and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great
abundance
and he brought forth the people that were therein and put them
under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and
made them pass through the brickkiln and thus did he unto all the
cities of the children of ammon so david and all the people returned
unto jerusalem
and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had
a fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved
her
and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamar
for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything
to her
but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of
shimeah davids brother and jonadab was a very subtil man
and he said unto him why art thou being the kings son lean
from day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said unto him i
love tamar my brother absaloms sister
and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make
thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him i
pray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress the
meat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand
so amnon lay down and made himself sick and when the king was
come to see him amnon said unto the king i pray thee let tamar my
sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eat
at her hand
then david sent home to tamar saying go now to thy brother
amnons house and dress him meat
so tamar went to her brother amnons house and he was laid down
and she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and
did bake the cakes
and she took a pan and poured them out before him but he
refused to eat and amnon said have out all men from me and they
went out every man from him
and amnon said unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber that
i may eat of thine hand and tamar took the cakes which she had made
and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother
and when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold of
her and said unto her come lie with me my sister
and she answered him nay my brother do not force me for no
such thing ought to be done in israel do not thou this folly
and i whither shall i cause my shame to go and as for thee
thou shalt be as one of the fools in israel now therefore i pray
thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee
howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger
than she forced her and lay with her
then amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith
he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her and
amnon said unto her arise be gone
and she said unto him there is no cause this evil in sending
me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me but he
would not hearken unto her
then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said
put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her for with such
robes were the kings daughters that were virgins apparelled then his
servant brought her out and bolted the door after her
and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers
colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on
crying
and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thy brother
been with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother
regard not this thing so tamar remained desolate in her brother
absaloms house
but when king david heard of all these things he was very
wroth
and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad
for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar
and it came to pass after two full years that absalom had
sheepshearers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom
invited all the kings sons
and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant
hath sheepshearers let the king i beseech thee and his servants go
with thy servant
and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all now
go lest we be chargeable unto thee and he pressed him howbeit he
would not go but blessed him
then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go
with us and the king said unto him why should he go with thee
but absalom pressed him that he let amnon and all the kings
sons go with him
now absalom had commanded his servants saying mark ye now when
amnons heart is merry with wine and when i say unto you smite
amnon then kill him fear not have not i commanded you be
courageous and be valiant
and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had
commanded
then all the kings sons arose and every man gat him up upon his
mule and fled
and it came to pass while they were in the way that tidings
came to david saying absalom hath slain all the kings sons and
there is not one of them left
then the king arose and tare his garments and lay on the
earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent
and jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother answered and
said let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men
the kings sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment of
absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his
sister tamar
now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
heart to think that all the kings sons are dead for amnon only is
dead
but absalom fled and the young man that kept the watch lifted
up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by the
way of the hill side behind him
and jonadab said unto the king behold the kings sons come as
thy servant said so it is
and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking
that behold the kings sons came and lifted up their voice and
wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore
but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud king
of geshur and david mourned for his son every day
so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years
and the soul of king david longed to go forth unto absalom for
he was comforted concerning amnon seeing he was dead
now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the kings heart was
toward absalom
and joab sent to tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman and
said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on
now mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a
woman that had a long time mourned for the dead  and come to the
king and speak on this manner unto him so joab put the words in her
mouth
and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on her
face to the ground and did obeisance and said help o king
and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered i
am indeed a widow woman and mine husband is dead
and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in
the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the
other and slew him
and behold the whole family is risen against thine handmaid
and they said deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill
him for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy the
heir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shall
not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth
and the king said unto the woman go to thine house and i will
give charge concerning thee
and the woman of tekoah said unto the king my lord o king the
iniquity be on me and on my fathers house and the king and his
throne be guiltless
and the king said whoever saith ought unto thee bring him to
me and he shall not touch thee any more
then said she i pray thee let the king remember the lord thy
god that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy
any more lest they destroy my son and he said as the lord liveth
there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth
then the woman said let thine handmaid i pray thee speak one
word unto my lord the king and he said say on
and the woman said wherefore then hast thou thought such a
thing against the people of god for the king doth speak this thing as
one which is faulty in that the king doth not fetch home again his
banished
for we must needs die and are as water spilt on the ground
which cannot be gathered up again neither doth god respect any
person yet doth he devise means that his banished be not expelled
from him
now therefore that i am come to speak of this thing unto my lord
the king it is because the people have made me afraid and thy
handmaid said i will now speak unto the king it may be that the king
will perform the request of his handmaid
for the king will hear to deliver his handmaid out of the hand
of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the
inheritance of god
then thine handmaid said the word of my lord the king shall now
be comfortable for as an angel of god so is my lord the king to
discern good and bad therefore the lord thy god will be with thee
then the king answered and said unto the woman hide not from
me i pray thee the thing that i shall ask thee and the woman said
let my lord the king now speak
and the king said is not the hand of joab with thee in all
this  and the woman answered and said as thy soul liveth my lord
the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought
that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant joab he bade me
and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid  to
fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant joab done this thing
and my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of god to
know all things that are in the earth
and the king said unto joab behold now i have done this thing
go therefore bring the young man absalom again
and joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and
thanked the king and joab said to day thy servant knoweth that i
have found grace in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hath
fulfilled the request of his servant
so joab arose and went to geshur and brought absalom to
jerusalem
and the king said let him turn to his own house and let him
not see my face so absalom returned to his own house and saw not the
kings face
but in all israel there was none to be so much praised as
absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of
his head there was no blemish in him
and when he polled his head for it was at every years end
that he polled it because the hair was heavy on him therefore he
polled it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels
after the kings weight
and unto absalom there were born three sons and one daughter
whose name was tamar she was a woman of a fair countenance
so absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem and saw not the
kings face
therefore absalom sent for joab to have sent him to the king
but he would not come to him and when he sent again the second time
he would not come
therefore he said unto his servants see joabs field is near
mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire and absaloms
servants set the field on fire
then joab arose and came to absalom unto his house and said
unto him wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire   and
absalom answered joab behold i sent unto thee saying come hither
that i may send thee to the king to say wherefore am i come from
geshur it had been good for me to have been there still now
therefore let me see the kings face and if there be any iniquity in
me let him kill me
so joab came to the king and told him and when he had called
for absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the
ground before the king and the king kissed absalom
and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared him
chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him
and absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate
and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the
king for judgment then absalom called unto him and said of what
city art thou and he said thy servant is of one of the tribes of
israel
and absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and right
but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee
absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the land
that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and i
would do him justice   and it was so that when any man came nigh
to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him and
kissed him
and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to the
king for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel
and it came to pass after forty years that absalom said unto the
king i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vowed unto
the lord in hebron
for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syria
saying if the lord shall bring me again indeed to jerusalem then i
will serve the lord
and the king said unto him go in peace so he arose and went to
hebron
but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel
saying as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall
say absalom reigneth in hebron
and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem that
were called and they went in their simplicity and they knew not any
thing
and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite davids
counsellor from his city even from giloh while he offered
sacrifices and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased
continually with absalom
and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of the
men of israel are after absalom
and david said unto all his servants that were with him at
jerusalem arise and let us flee for we shall not else escape from
absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring
evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword
and the kings servants said unto the king behold thy servants
are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint
and the king went forth and all his household after him and
the king left ten women which were concubines to keep the house
and the king went forth and all the people after him and
tarried in a place that was far off
and all his servants passed on beside him and all the
cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred
men which came after him from gath passed on before the king
then said the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thou
also with us return to thy place and abide with the king for thou
art a stranger and also an exile
whereas thou camest but yesterday should i this day make thee
go up and down with us seeing i go whither i may return thou and
take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee
and ittai answered the king and said as the lord liveth and
as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king
shall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servant
be
and david said to ittai go and pass over and ittai the gittite
passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with
him
and all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people
passed over the king also himself passed over the brook kidron and
all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness
and lo zadok also and all the levites were with him bearing
the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and
abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the
city
and the king said unto zadok carry back the ark of god into the
city if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord he will bring me
again and shew me both it and his habitation  but if he thus
say i have no delight in thee behold here am i let him do to me as
seemeth good unto him
the king said also unto zadok the priest art not thou a seer
return into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz thy
son and jonathan the son of abiathar
see i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there
come word from you to certify me
zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to
jerusalem and they tarried there
and david went up by the ascent of mount olivet and wept as he
went up and had his head covered and he went barefoot and all the
people that was with him covered every man his head and they went up
weeping as they went up
and one told david saying ahithophel is among the conspirators
with absalom and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel of
ahithophel into foolishness
and it came to pass that when david was come to the top of the
mount where he worshipped god behold hushai the archite came to
meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head  unto whom
david said if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden
unto me  but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom i
will be thy servant o king as i have been thy fathers servant
hitherto so will i now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me
defeat the counsel of ahithophel
and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the
priests  therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt
hear out of the kings house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar
the priests
behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaaz
zadoks son and jonathan abiathars son and by them ye shall send
unto me every thing that ye can hear
so hushai davids friend came into the city and absalom came
into jerusalem
and when david was a little past the top of the hill behold
ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses
saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and an hundred
bunches of raisins and an hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of
wine
and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these and ziba
said the asses be for the kings household to ride on and the bread
and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as
be faint in the wilderness may drink
and the king said and where is thy masters son and ziba said
unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said to day
shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father
then said the king to ziba behold thine are all that pertained
unto mephibosheth and ziba said i humbly beseech thee that i may
find grace in thy sight my lord o king
and when king david came to bahurim behold thence came out a
man of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimei the son
of gera he came forth and cursed still as he came
and he cast stones at david and at all the servants of king
david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right
hand and on his left
and thus said shimei when he cursed come out come out thou
bloody man and thou man of belial  the lord hath returned upon
thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast
reigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of
absalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thy mischief because
thou art a bloody man
then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why should
this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and
take off his head
and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons of
zeruiah  so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him curse
david who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so   and
david said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son which
came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this
benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath
bidden him
it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction and that
the lord will requite me good for his cursing this day
and as david and his men went by the way shimei went along on
the hills side over against him and cursed as he went and threw
stones at him and cast dust
and the king and all the people that were with him came weary
and refreshed themselves there
and absalom and all the people the men of israel came to
jerusalem and ahithophel with him
and it came to pass when hushai the archite davids friend
was come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save the
king god save the king
and absalom said to hushai is this thy kindness to thy friend
why wentest thou not with thy friend   and hushai said unto
absalom nay but whom the lord and this people and all the men of
israel choose his will i be and with him will i abide
and again whom should i serve should i not serve in the
presence of his son as i have served in thy fathers presence so
will i be in thy presence
then said absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what we
shall do
and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thy fathers
concubines which he hath left to keep the house and all israel shall
hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of all
that are with thee be strong
so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house and
absalom went in unto his fathers concubines in the sight of all
israel
and the counsel of ahithophel which he counselled in those
days was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of god so was all
the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom
moreover ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choose out
twelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david this
night  and i will come upon him while he is weary and weak
handed and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him
shall flee and i will smite the king only  and i will bring back
all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all
returned so all the people shall be in peace
and the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders of
israel
then said absalom call now hushai the archite also and let us
hear likewise what he saith
and when hushai was come to absalom absalom spake unto him
saying ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after
his saying if not speak thou
and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath
given is not good at this time
for said hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they
be mighty men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of
her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not
lodge with the people
behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it
will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that
whosoever heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the people
that follow absalom
and he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a
lion shall utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is a
mighty man and they which be with him are valiant men
therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered unto
thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for
multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person
so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found
and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of
him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so
much as one
moreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all israel
bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until
there be not one small stone found there
and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of
hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel for the
lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the
intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom
then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thus
and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel and
thus and thus have i counselled
now therefore send quickly and tell david saying lodge not
this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass over
lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him
now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel for they might not
be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them and
they went and told king david
nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom but they went
both of them away quickly and came to a mans house in bahurim which
had a well in his court whither they went down
and the woman took and spread a covering over the wells mouth
and spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not known
and when absaloms servants came to the woman to the house they
said where is ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto them
they be gone over the brook of water and when they had sought and
could not find them they returned to jerusalem
and it came to pass after they were departed that they came up
out of the well and went and told king david and said unto david
arise and pass quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophel
counselled against you
then david arose and all the people that were with him and
they passed over jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of
them that was not gone over jordan
and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he
saddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to his
city and put his household in order and hanged himself and died
and was buried in the sepulchre of his father
then david came to mahanaim and absalom passed over jordan he
and all the men of israel with him
and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab
which amasa was a mans son whose name was ithra an israelite that
went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joabs
mother
so israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead
and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobi
the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the
son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim
brought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat and
barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles and
parched pulse  and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of
kine for david and for the people that were with him to eat for
they said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the
wilderness
and david numbered the people that were with him and set
captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them
and david sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of
joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah
joabs brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite
and the king said unto the people i will surely go forth with you
myself also
but the people answered thou shalt not go forth for if we flee
away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they
care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now
it is better that thou succour us out of the city
and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do and
the king stood by the gate side and all the people came out by
hundreds and by thousands
and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying deal
gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the
people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning
absalom
so the people went out into the field against israel and the
battle was in the wood of ephraim  where the people of israel
were slain before the servants of david and there was there a great
slaughter that day of twenty thousand men
for the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword
devoured
and absalom met the servants of david and absalom rode upon a
mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his
head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the heaven
and the earth and the mule that was under him went away
and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw
absalom hanged in an oak
and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou
sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and
i would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle
and the man said unto joab though i should receive a thousand
shekels of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine hand
against the kings son for in our hearing the king charged thee and
abishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young man
absalom
otherwise i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life
for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest
have set thyself against me
then said joab i may not tarry thus with thee and he took
three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom
while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak
and ten young men that bare joabs armour compassed about and
smote absalom and slew him
and joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing
after israel for joab held back the people
and they took absalom and cast him into a great pit in the
wood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all israel
fled every one to his tent
now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself
a pillar which is in the kings dale for he said i have no son to
keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own
name and it is called unto this day absaloms place
then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the
king tidings how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies
and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day
but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear
no tidings because the kings son is dead
then said joab to cushi go tell the king what thou hast seen
and cushi bowed himself unto joab and ran
then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but
howsoever let me i pray thee also run after cushi and joab said
wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou hast no tidings
ready   but howsoever said he let me run and he said unto
him run then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran cushi
and david sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to
the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and
looked and behold a man running alone
and the watchman cried and told the king and the king said if
he be alone there is tidings in his mouth and he came apace and
drew near
and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman
called unto the porter and said behold another man running alone
and the king said he also bringeth tidings
and the watchman said me thinketh the running of the foremost
is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said he
is a good man and cometh with good tidings
and ahimaaz called and said unto the king all is well and he
fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said
blessed be the lord thy god which hath delivered up the men that
lifted up their hand against my lord the king
and the king said is the young man absalom safe and ahimaaz
answered when joab sent the kings servant and me thy servant i saw
a great tumult but i knew not what it was
and the king said unto him turn aside and stand here and he
turned aside and stood still
and behold cushi came and cushi said tidings my lord the
king for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up
against thee
and the king said unto cushi is the young man absalom safe and
cushi answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise
against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is
and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the
gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my
son my son absalom would god i had died for thee o absalom my son
my son   and it was told joab behold the king weepeth and
mourneth for absalom
and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for
his son
and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city as
people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle
but the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud
voice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son   and joab
came into the house to the king and said thou hast shamed this day
the faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life and
the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy
wives and the lives of thy concubines  in that thou lovest thine
enemies and hatest thy friends for thou hast declared this day that
thou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day i perceive
that if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had
pleased thee well
now therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thy
servants for i swear by the lord if thou go not forth there will
not tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee
than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now
then the king arose and sat in the gate and they told unto all
the people saying behold the king doth sit in the gate and all the
people came before the king for israel had fled every man to his
tent
and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
israel saying the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and
he delivered us out of the hand of the philistines and now he is fled
out of the land for absalom
and absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle now
therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back
and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying
speak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bring
the king back to his house seeing the speech of all israel is come to
the king even to his house
ye are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then
are ye the last to bring back the king   and say ye to amasa
art thou not of my bone and of my flesh god do so to me and more
also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the
room of joab
and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as the
heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king return
thou and all thy servants
so the king returned and came to jordan and judah came to
gilgal to go to meet the king to conduct the king over jordan
and shimei the son of gera a benjamite which was of bahurim
hasted and came down with the men of judah to meet king david
and there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba the
servant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty
servants with him and they went over jordan before the king
and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the kings
household and to do what he thought good and shimei the son of gera
fell down before the king as he was come over jordan  and said
unto the king let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do
thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my
lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to
his heart
for thy servant doth know that i have sinned therefore behold
i am come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to
meet my lord the king
but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said shall not
shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the lords
anointed   and david said what have i to do with you ye sons
of zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall
there any man be put to death this day in israel for do not i know
that i am this day king over israel   therefore the king said
unto shimei thou shalt not die and the king sware unto him
and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king and
had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his
clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in
peace
and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet the
king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with me
mephibosheth   and he answered my lord o king my servant
deceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i may
ride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lame
and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my
lord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good in
thine eyes
for all of my fathers house were but dead men before my lord
the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at
thine own table what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto
the king   and the king said unto him why speakest thou any
more of thy matters i have said thou and ziba divide the land
and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take all
forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own
house
and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and went
over jordan with the king to conduct him over jordan
now barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and
he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for
he was a very great man
and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i
will feed thee with me in jerusalem
and barzillai said unto the king how long have i to live that
i should go up with the king unto jerusalem   i am this day
fourscore years old and can i discern between good and evil can thy
servant taste what i eat or what i drink can i hear any more the
voice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thy
servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king   thy servant will
go a little way over jordan with the king and why should the king
recompense it me with such a reward   let thy servant i pray
thee turn back again that i may die in mine own city and be buried
by the grave of my father and of my mother but behold thy servant
chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what
shall seem good unto thee
and the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i will
do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou
shalt require of me that will i do for thee
and all the people went over jordan and when the king was come
over the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto
his own place
then the king went on to gilgal and chimham went on with him
and all the people of judah conducted the king and also half the
people of israel
and behold all the men of israel came to the king and said
unto the king why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee
away and have brought the king and his household and all davids
men with him over jordan   and all the men of judah answered
the men of israel because the king is near of kin to us wherefore
then be ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all of the kings
cost or hath he given us any gift   and the men of israel
answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king
and we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despise
us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king
and the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the
men of israel
and there happened to be there a man of belial whose name was
sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew a trumpet and
said we have no part in david neither have we inheritance in the son
of jesse every man to his tents o israel
so every man of israel went up from after david and followed
sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their king
from jordan even to jerusalem
and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the
ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put
them in ward and fed them but went not in unto them so they were
shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood
then said the king to amasa assemble me the men of judah within
three days and be thou here present
so amasa went to assemble the men of judah but he tarried longer
than the set time which he had appointed him
and david said to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri do
us more harm than did absalom take thou thy lords servants and
pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape us
and there went out after him joabs men and the cherethites and
the pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of
jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri
when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa went
before them and joabs garment that he had put on was girded unto
him and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the
sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out
and joab said to amasa art thou in health my brother and joab
took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him
but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joabs hand so
he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels to
the ground and struck him not again and he died so joab and abishai
his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri
and one of joabs men stood by him and said he that favoureth
joab and he that is for david let him go after joab
and amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway and
when the man saw that all the people stood still he removed amasa out
of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he saw
that every one that came by him stood still
when he was removed out of the highway all the people went on
after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri
and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel and to
bethmaachah and all the berites and they were gathered together and
went also after him
and they came and besieged him in abel of bethmaachah and they
cast up a bank against the city and it stood in the trench and all
the people that were with joab battered the wall to throw it down
then cried a wise woman out of the city hear hear say i pray
you unto joab come near hither that i may speak with thee
and when he was come near unto her the woman said art thou
joab  and he answered i am he then she said unto him hear the
words of thine handmaid and he answered i do hear
then she spake saying they were wont to speak in old time
saying they shall surely ask counsel at abel and so they ended the
matter
i am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel thou
seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel why wilt thou
swallow up the inheritance of the lord   and joab answered and
said far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up or
destroy
the matter is not so but a man of mount ephraim sheba the son
of bichri by name hath lifted up his hand against the king even
against david deliver him only and i will depart from the city and
the woman said unto joab behold his head shall be thrown to thee
over the wall
then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom and they
cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and cast it out to joab
and he blew a trumpet and they retired from the city every man to
his tent and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king
now joab was over all the host of israel and benaiah the son of
jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites  and
adoram was over the tribute and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was
recorder  and sheva was scribe and zadok and abiathar were the
priests  and ira also the jairite was a chief ruler about david
then there was a famine in the days of david three years year
after year and david enquired of the lord and the lord answered it
is for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites
and the king called the gibeonites and said unto them now the
gibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of
the amorites and the children of israel had sworn unto them and saul
sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of israel and judah
wherefore david said unto the gibeonites what shall i do for
you  and wherewith shall i make the atonement that ye may bless the
inheritance of the lord   and the gibeonites said unto him we
will have no silver nor gold of saul nor of his house neither for us
shalt thou kill any man in israel and he said what ye shall say
that will i do for you
and they answered the king the man that consumed us and that
devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any
of the coasts of israel  let seven men of his sons be delivered
unto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul
whom the lord did choose and the king said i will give them
but the king spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of
saul because of the lords oath that was between them between david
and jonathan the son of saul
but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah
whom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons of
michal the daughter of saul whom she brought up for adriel the son of
barzillai the meholathite  and he delivered them into the hands
of the gibeonites and they hanged them in the hill before the lord
and they fell all seven together and were put to death in the days of
harvest in the first days in the beginning of barley harvest
and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it
for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water
dropped upon them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of the
air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night
and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the
concubine of saul had done
and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of
jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead which had stolen them
from the street of bethshan where the philistines had hanged them
when the philistines had slain saul in gilboa  and he brought up
from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son and
they gathered the bones of them that were hanged
and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried they in the
country of benjamin in zelah in the sepulchre of kish his father and
they performed all that the king commanded and after that god was
intreated for the land
moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel and
david went down and his servants with him and fought against the
philistines and david waxed faint
and ishbibenob which was of the sons of the giant the weight
of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight he
being girded with a new sword thought to have slain david
but abishai the son of zeruiah succoured him and smote the
philistine and killed him then the men of david sware unto him
saying thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quench
not the light of israel
and it came to pass after this that there was again a battle
with the philistines at gob then sibbechai the hushathite slew saph
which was of the sons of the giant
and there was again a battle in gob with the philistines where
elhanan the son of jaareoregim a bethlehemite slew the brother of
goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weavers
beam
and there was yet a battle in gath where was a man of great
stature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six
toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant
and when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimeah the
brother of david slew him
these four were born to the giant in gath and fell by the hand
of david and by the hand of his servants
and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day
that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies
and out of the hand of saul  and he said the lord is my rock
and my fortress and my deliverer  the god of my rock in him
will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high
tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence
i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i
be saved from mine enemies
when the waves of death compassed me the floods of ungodly men
made me afraid  the sorrows of hell compassed me about the
snares of death prevented me  in my distress i called upon the
lord and cried to my god and he did hear my voice out of his temple
and my cry did enter into his ears
then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heaven
moved and shook because he was wroth
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his
mouth devoured coals were kindled by it
he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under
his feet
and he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen upon the
wings of the wind
and he made darkness pavilions round about him dark waters and
thick clouds of the skies
through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled
the lord thundered from heaven and the most high uttered his
voice
and he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning and
discomfited them
and the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the
world were discovered at the rebuking of the lord at the blast of
the breath of his nostrils
he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters
he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated
me for they were too strong for me
they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my
stay
he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me
because he delighted in me
the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to
the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me
for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly
departed from my god
for all his judgments were before me and as for his statutes i
did not depart from them
i was also upright before him and have kept myself from mine
iniquity
therefore the lord hath recompensed me according to my
righteousness according to my cleanness in his eye sight
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful and with the
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward
thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury
and the afflicted people thou wilt save but thine eyes are upon
the haughty that thou mayest bring them down
for thou art my lamp o lord and the lord will lighten my
darkness
for by thee i have run through a troop by my god have i leaped
over a wall
as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried
he is a buckler to all them that trust in him
for who is god save the lord and who is a rock save our god
god is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect
he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high
places
he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by
mine arms
thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy
gentleness hath made me great
thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my feet did not
slip
i have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them and turned not
again until i had consumed them
and i have consumed them and wounded them that they could not
arise yea they are fallen under my feet
for thou hast girded me with strength to battle them that rose
up against me hast thou subdued under me
thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might
destroy them that hate me
they looked but there was none to save even unto the lord but
he answered them not
then did i beat them as small as the dust of the earth i did
stamp them as the mire of the street and did spread them abroad
thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people
thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen a people which i knew not
shall serve me
strangers shall submit themselves unto me as soon as they hear
they shall be obedient unto me
strangers shall fade away and they shall be afraid out of their
close places
the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god
of the rock of my salvation
it is god that avengeth me and that bringeth down the people
under me
and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies thou also hast
lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me thou hast
delivered me from the violent man
therefore i will give thanks unto thee o lord among the
heathen and i will sing praises unto thy name
he is the tower of salvation for his king and sheweth mercy to
his anointed unto david and to his seed for evermore
now these be the last words of david david the son of jesse
said and the man who was raised up on high the anointed of the god
of jacob and the sweet psalmist of israel said  the spirit of
the lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue
the god of israel said the rock of israel spake to me he that
ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of god
and he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun riseth
even a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out of
the earth by clear shining after rain
although my house be not so with god yet he hath made with me an
everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for this is all
my salvation and all my desire although he make it not to grow
but the sons of belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
away because they cannot be taken with hands  but the man that
shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear
and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place
these be the names of the mighty men whom david had the
tachmonite that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same
was adino the eznite he lift up his spear against eight hundred whom
he slew at one time
and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite one of the
three mighty men with david when they defied the philistines that
were there gathered together to battle and the men of israel were
gone away  he arose and smote the philistines until his hand
was weary and his hand clave unto the sword and the lord wrought a
great victory that day and the people returned after him only to
spoil
and after him was shammah the son of agee the hararite and the
philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of
ground full of lentiles and the people fled from the philistines
but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and
slew the philistines and the lord wrought a great victory
and three of the thirty chief went down and came to david in
the harvest time unto the cave of adullam and the troop of the
philistines pitched in the valley of rephaim
and david was then in an hold and the garrison of the
philistines was then in bethlehem
and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of
the water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate   and
the three mighty men brake through the host of the philistines and
drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and
took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink
thereof but poured it out unto the lord
and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do this
is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives
therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty
men
and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah was chief
among three and he lifted up his spear against three hundred and
slew them and had the name among three
was he not most honourable of three therefore he was their
captain howbeit he attained not unto the first three
and benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of
kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab he
went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow
and he slew an egyptian a goodly man and the egyptian had a
spear in his hand but he went down to him with a staff and plucked
the spear out of the egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear
these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name
among three mighty men
he was more honourable than the thirty but he attained not to
the first three and david set him over his guard
asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty elhanan the
son of dodo of bethlehem  shammah the harodite elika the
harodite  helez the paltite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite
abiezer the anethothite mebunnai the hushathite  zalmon
the ahohite maharai the netophathite  heleb the son of baanah
a netophathite ittai the son of ribai out of gibeah of the children
of benjamin  benaiah the pirathonite hiddai of the brooks of
gaash  abialbon the arbathite azmaveth the barhumite
eliahba the shaalbonite of the sons of jashen jonathan
shammah the hararite ahiam the son of sharar the hararite
eliphelet the son of ahasbai the son of the maachathite eliam the
son of ahithophel the gilonite  hezrai the carmelite paarai the
arbite  igal the son of nathan of zobah bani the gadite
zelek the ammonite nahari the beerothite armourbearer to joab the
son of zeruiah  ira an ithrite gareb an ithrite  uriah
the hittite thirty and seven in all
and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and
he moved david against them to say go number israel and judah
for the king said to joab the captain of the host which was with
him go now through all the tribes of israel from dan even to
beersheba and number ye the people that i may know the number of the
people
and joab said unto the king now the lord thy god add unto the
people how many soever they be an hundredfold and that the eyes of
my lord the king may see it but why doth my lord the king delight in
this thing   notwithstanding the kings word prevailed against
joab and against the captains of the host and joab and the captains
of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the
people of israel
and they passed over jordan and pitched in aroer on the right
side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad and
toward jazer  then they came to gilead and to the land of
tahtimhodshi and they came to danjaan and about to zidon  and
came to the strong hold of tyre and to all the cities of the hivites
and of the canaanites and they went out to the south of judah even
to beersheba
so when they had gone through all the land they came to
jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days
and joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
king and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that
drew the sword and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men
and davids heart smote him after that he had numbered the
people
and david said unto the lord i have sinned greatly in that i have
done and now i beseech thee o lord take away the iniquity of thy
servant for i have done very foolishly
for when david was up in the morning the word of the lord came
unto the prophet gad davids seer saying  go and say unto
david thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one
of them that i may do it unto thee
so gad came to david and told him and said unto him shall
seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou flee
three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee or that
there be three days pestilence in thy land now advise and see what
answer i shall return to him that sent me
and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let us fall now
into the hand of the lord for his mercies are great and let me not
fall into the hand of man
so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even
to the time appointed and there died of the people from dan even to
beersheba seventy thousand men
and when the angel stretched out his hand upon jerusalem to
destroy it the lord repented him of the evil and said to the angel
that destroyed the people it is enough stay now thine hand and the
angel of the lord was by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite
and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote
the people and said lo i have sinned and i have done wickedly but
these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee be
against me and against my fathers house
and gad came that day to david and said unto him go up rear
an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite
and david according to the saying of gad went up as the lord
commanded
and araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on
toward him and araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on
his face upon the ground
and araunah said wherefore is my lord the king come to his
servant  and david said to buy the threshingfloor of thee to build
an altar unto the lord that the plague may be stayed from the people
and araunah said unto david let my lord the king take and offer
up what seemeth good unto him behold here be oxen for burnt
sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen
for wood
all these things did araunah as a king give unto the king and
araunah said unto the king the lord thy god accept thee
and the king said unto araunah nay but i will surely buy it of
thee at a price neither will i offer burnt offerings unto the lord my
god of that which doth cost me nothing so david bought the
threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver
and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings so the lord was intreated for the land
and the plague was stayed from israel
the first book of the kings
commonly called
the third book of the kings
now king david was old and stricken in years and they covered
him with clothes but he gat no heat
wherefore his servants said unto him let there be sought for my
lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king and
let her cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the
king may get heat
so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
israel and found abishag a shunammite and brought her to the king
and the damsel was very fair and cherished the king and
ministered to him but the king knew her not
then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself saying i will
be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to
run before him
and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying why
hast thou done so and he also was a very goodly man and his mother
bare him after absalom
and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar
the priest and they following adonijah helped him
but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan
the prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men which belonged to
david were not with adonijah
and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of
zoheleth which is by enrogel and called all his brethren the kings
sons and all the men of judah the kings servants  but nathan
the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brother
he called not
wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon
saying hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth
reign and david our lord knoweth it not   now therefore come
let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine
own life and the life of thy son solomon
go and get thee in unto king david and say unto him didst not
thou my lord o king swear unto thine handmaid saying assuredly
solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne
why then doth adonijah reign   behold while thou yet talkest
there with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thy
words
and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the
king was very old and abishag the shunammite ministered unto the
king
and bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king and the
king said what wouldest thou   and she said unto him my lord
thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid saying
assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon
my throne
and now behold adonijah reigneth and now my lord the king
thou knowest it not  and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and
sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and
abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but solomon thy
servant hath he not called
and thou my lord o king the eyes of all israel are upon thee
that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord
the king after him
otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall
sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted
offenders
and lo while she yet talked with the king nathan the prophet
also came in
and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet and
when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king
with his face to the ground
and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said adonijah shall
reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne   for he is gone
down this day and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in
abundance and hath called all the kings sons and the captains of
the host and abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink
before him and say god save king adonijah
but me even me thy servant and zadok the priest and benaiah
the son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not called
is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not shewed
it unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king
after him   then king david answered and said call me bathsheba
and she came into the kings presence and stood before the king
and the king sware and said as the lord liveth that hath
redeemed my soul out of all distress  even as i sware unto thee
by the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall
reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so
will i certainly do this day
then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did
reverence to the king and said let my lord king david live for ever
and king david said call me zadok the priest and nathan the
prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they came before the
king
the king also said unto them take with you the servants of your
lord and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring
him down to gihon  and let zadok the priest and nathan the
prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with the
trumpet and say god save king solomon
then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my
throne for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him to
be ruler over israel and over judah
and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and said
amen the lord god of my lord the king say so too
as the lord hath been with my lord the king even so be he with
solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king
david
so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son
of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and
caused solomon to ride upon king davids mule and brought him to
gihon
and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle
and anointed solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people
said god save king solomon
and all the people came up after him and the people piped with
pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the
sound of them
and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
they had made an end of eating and when joab heard the sound of the
trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an
uproar   and while he yet spake behold jonathan the son of
abiathar the priest came and adonijah said unto him come in for
thou art a valiant man and bringest good tidings
and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord king
david hath made solomon king
and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the
prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the
pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the kings mule
and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him
king in gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the
city rang again this is the noise that ye have heard
and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom
and moreover the kings servants came to bless our lord king
david saying god make the name of solomon better than thy name and
make his throne greater than thy throne and the king bowed himself
upon the bed
and also thus said the king blessed be the lord god of israel
which hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even
seeing it
and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid and rose
up and went every man his way
and adonijah feared because of solomon and arose and went and
caught hold on the horns of the altar
and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth king
solomon for lo he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar
saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his
servant with the sword
and solomon said if he will shew himself a worthy man there
shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be
found in him he shall die
so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar
and he came and bowed himself to king solomon and solomon said unto
him go to thine house
now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged
solomon his son saying  i go the way of all the earth be thou
strong therefore and shew thyself a man  and keep the charge of
the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his
commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written
in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest
and whithersoever thou turnest thyself  that the lord may continue
his word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take
heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and
with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the
throne of israel
moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me
and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel unto abner
the son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew and
shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his
girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his
feet
do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go
down to the grave in peace
but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite and
let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me
when i fled because of absalom thy brother
and behold thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera a
benjamite of bahurim which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day
when i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at jordan and i
sware to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death with
the sword
now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and
knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him but his hoar head bring
thou down to the grave with blood
so david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of
david
and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years
seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned
he in jerusalem
then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father and his
kingdom was established greatly
and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of
solomon and she said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably
he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee and she said
say on
and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all
israel set their faces on me that i should reign howbeit the kingdom
is turned about and is become my brothers for it was his from the
lord
and now i ask one petition of thee deny me not and she said
unto him say on
and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king for he
will not say thee nay that he give me abishag the shunammite to
wife
and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee unto the king
bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him for
adonijah and the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto
her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the
kings mother and she sat on his right hand
then she said i desire one small petition of thee i pray thee
say me not nay and the king said unto her ask on my mother for i
will not say thee nay
and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy
brother to wife
and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why dost
thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ask for him the kingdom
also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for abiathar the
priest and for joab the son of zeruiah
then king solomon sware by the lord saying god do so to me and
more also if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life
now therefore as the lord liveth which hath established me and
set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me an
house as he promised adonijah shall be put to death this day
and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada
and he fell upon him that he died
and unto abiathar the priest said the king get thee to anathoth
unto thine own fields for thou art worthy of death but i will not at
this time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the lord
god before david my father and because thou hast been afflicted in
all wherein my father was afflicted
so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lord
that he might fulfil the word of the lord which he spake concerning
the house of eli in shiloh
then tidings came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah
though he turned not after absalom and joab fled unto the tabernacle
of the lord and caught hold on the horns of the altar
and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the
tabernacle of the lord and behold he is by the altar then solomon
sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him
and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord and said unto
him thus saith the king come forth and he said nay but i will die
here and benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joab
and thus he answered me
and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon
him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood
which joab shed from me and from the house of my father
and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fell
upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the
sword my father david not knowing thereof to wit abner the son of
ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether
captain of the host of judah
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab and
upon the head of his seed for ever but upon david and upon his seed
and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever
from the lord
so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him and
slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness
and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the
host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar
and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him build
thee an house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence
any whither
for it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over
the brook kidron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely
die thy blood shall be upon thine own head
and shimei said unto the king the saying is good as my lord the
king hath said so will thy servant do and shimei dwelt in jerusalem
many days
and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the
servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath
and they told shimei saying behold thy servants be in gath
and shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achish
to seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants from
gath
and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to
gath and was come again
and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him did i
not make thee to swear by the lord and protested unto thee saying
know for a certain on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad any
whither that thou shalt surely die and thou saidst unto me the word
that i have heard is good
why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord and the
commandment that i have charged thee with   the king said
moreover to shimei thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart
is privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore the lord
shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head  and king solomon
shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before
the lord for ever
so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada which went
out and fell upon him that he died and the kingdom was established
in the hand of solomon
and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and took
pharaohs daughter and brought her into the city of david until he
had made an end of building his own house and the house of the lord
and the wall of jerusalem round about
only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no
house built unto the name of the lord until those days
and solomon loved the lord walking in the statutes of david his
father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places
and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the
great high place a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon
that altar
in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and
god said ask what i shall give thee
and solomon said thou hast shewed unto thy servant david my
father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and
in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast
kept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son to
sit on his throne as it is this day
and now o lord my god thou hast made thy servant king instead of
david my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go out
or come in
and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for
multitude
give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to
judge this thy so great a people   and the speech pleased the
lord that solomon had asked this thing
and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and
hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for
thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for
thyself understanding to discern judgment  behold i have done
according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and an
understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee
neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee
and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both
riches and honour so that there shall not be any among the kings
like unto thee all thy days
and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my
commandments as thy father david did walk then i will lengthen thy
days
and solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to
jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord and
offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a
feast to all his servants
then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and
stood before him
and the one woman said o my lord i and this woman dwell in one
house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house
and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered
that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no
stranger with us in the house save we two in the house
and this womans child died in the night because she overlaid
it
and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while
thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead
child in my bosom
and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it
was dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it was
not my son which i did bear
and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the
dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son and the
living is my son thus they spake before the king
then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth
and thy son is the dead and the other saith nay but thy son is the
dead and my son is the living
and the king said bring me a sword and they brought a sword
before the king
and the king said divide the living child in two and give half
to the one and half to the other
then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king
for her bowels yearned upon her son and she said o my lord give her
the living child and in no wise slay it but the other said let it
be neither mine nor thine but divide it
then the king answered and said give her the living child and
in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof
and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged
and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in
him to do judgment
so king solomon was king over all israel
and these were the princes which he had azariah the son of zadok
the priest  elihoreph and ahiah the sons of shisha scribes
jehoshaphat the son of ahilud the recorder
and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host and zadok and
abiathar were the priests  and azariah the son of nathan was over
the officers and zabud the son of nathan was principal officer and
the kings friend  and ahishar was over the household and
adoniram the son of abda was over the tribute
and solomon had twelve officers over all israel which provided
victuals for the king and his household each man his month in a year
made provision
and these are their names the son of hur in mount ephraim
the son of dekar in makaz and in shaalbim and bethshemesh and
elonbethhanan  the son of hesed in aruboth to him pertained
sochoh and all the land of hepher  the son of abinadab in all
the region of dor which had taphath the daughter of solomon to wife
baana the son of ahilud to him pertained taanach and megiddo
and all bethshean which is by zartanah beneath jezreel from
bethshean to abelmeholah even unto the place that is beyond jokneam
the son of geber in ramothgilead to him pertained the towns of
jair the son of manasseh which are in gilead to him also pertained
the region of argob which is in bashan threescore great cities with
walls and brasen bars  ahinadab the son of iddo had mahanaim
ahimaaz was in naphtali he also took basmath the daughter of
solomon to wife  baanah the son of hushai was in asher and in
aloth  jehoshaphat the son of paruah in issachar  shimei
the son of elah in benjamin  geber the son of uri was in the
country of gilead in the country of sihon king of the amorites and
of og king of bashan and he was the only officer which was in the
land
judah and israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in
multitude eating and drinking and making merry
and solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
land of the philistines and unto the border of egypt they brought
presents and served solomon all the days of his life
and solomons provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
flour and threescore measures of meal  ten fat oxen and twenty
oxen out of the pastures and an hundred sheep beside harts and
roebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowl
for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river
from tiphsah even to azzah over all the kings on this side the river
and he had peace on all sides round about him
and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and
under his fig tree from dan even to beersheba all the days of
solomon
and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots
and twelve thousand horsemen
and those officers provided victual for king solomon and for all
that came unto king solomons table every man in his month they
lacked nothing
barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they
unto the place where the officers were every man according to his
charge
and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and
largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shore
and solomons wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of
the east country and all the wisdom of egypt
for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite and
heman and chalcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was in
all nations round about
and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a
thousand and five
and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in lebanon
even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of
beasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishes
and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon from
all kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom
and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon for he had
heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for
hiram was ever a lover of david
and solomon sent to hiram saying  thou knowest how that david
my father could not build an house unto the name of the lord his god
for the wars which were about him on every side until the lord put
them under the soles of his feet
but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side so that
there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent
and behold i purpose to build an house unto the name of the lord
my god as the lord spake unto david my father saying thy son whom
i will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build an house unto
my name
now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto thee
will i give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt
appoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can
skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians
and it came to pass when hiram heard the words of solomon that
he rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the lord this day which
hath given unto david a wise son over this great people
and hiram sent to solomon saying i have considered the things
which thou sentest to me for and i will do all thy desire concerning
timber of cedar and concerning timber of fir
my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea and i
will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt
appoint me and will cause them to be discharged there and thou shalt
receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for
my household
so hiram gave solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all
his desire
and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food
to his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave solomon
to hiram year by year
and the lord gave solomon wisdom as he promised him and there
was peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a league
together
and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levy
was thirty thousand men
and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a
month they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram was
over the levy
and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens
and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains  beside the chief
of solomons officers which were over the work three thousand and
three hundred which ruled over the people that wrought in the work
and the king commanded and they brought great stones costly
stones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the house
and solomons builders and hirams builders did hew them and the
stonesquarers so they prepared timber and stones to build the house
and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after
the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the
fourth year of solomons reign over israel in the month zif which is
the second month that he began to build the house of the lord
and the house which king solomon built for the lord the length
thereof was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits
and the height thereof thirty cubits
and the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits was
the length thereof according to the breadth of the house and ten
cubits was the breadth thereof before the house
and for the house he made windows of narrow lights
and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about
against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of
the oracle and he made chambers round about  the nethermost
chamber was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad
and the third was seven cubits broad for without in the wall of the
house he made narrowed rests round about that the beams should not be
fastened in the walls of the house
and the house when it was in building was built of stone made
ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer
nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in
building
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
house and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber
and out of the middle into the third
so he built the house and finished it and covered the house with
beams and boards of cedar
and then he built chambers against all the house five cubits
high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar
and the word of the lord came to solomon saying  concerning
this house which thou art in building if thou wilt walk in my
statutes and execute my judgments and keep all my commandments to
walk in them then will i perform my word with thee which i spake
unto david thy father  and i will dwell among the children of
israel and will not forsake my people israel
so solomon built the house and finished it
and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar
both the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling and he
covered them on the inside with wood and covered the floor of the
house with planks of fir
and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house both the
floor and the walls with boards of cedar he even built them for it
within even for the oracle even for the most holy place
and the house that is the temple before it was forty cubits
long
and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open
flowers all was cedar there was no stone seen
and the oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the
ark of the covenant of the lord
and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and
twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof and
he overlaid it with pure gold and so covered the altar which was of
cedar
so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he made
a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle and he overlaid
it with gold
and the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had finished
all the house also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid
with gold
and within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree each
ten cubits high
and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits
the other wing of the cherub from the uttermost part of the one wing
unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits
and the other cherub was ten cubits both the cherubims were of
one measure and one size
the height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of the
other cherub
and he set the cherubims within the inner house and they
stretched forth the wings of the cherubims so that the wing of the
one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the
other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the
house
and he overlaid the cherubims with gold
and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers within and
without
and the floors of the house he overlaid with gold within and
without
and for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree
the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall
the two doors also were of olive tree and he carved upon them
carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and overlaid
them with gold and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm
trees
so also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree a
fourth part of the wall
and the two doors were of fir tree the two leaves of the one
door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding
and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers
and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work
and he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone and
a row of cedar beams
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord
laid in the month zif  and in the eleventh year in the month
bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all
the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it so was he
seven years in building it
but solomon was building his own house thirteen years and he
finished all his house
he built also the house of the forest of lebanon the length
thereof was an hundred cubits and the breadth thereof fifty cubits
and the height thereof thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar pillars
with cedar beams upon the pillars
and it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on
forty five pillars fifteen in a row
and there were windows in three rows and light was against light
in three ranks
and all the doors and posts were square with the windows and
light was against light in three ranks
and he made a porch of pillars the length thereof was fifty
cubits and the breadth thereof thirty cubits and the porch was
before them and the other pillars and the thick beam were before
them
then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge even the
porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from one side of the
floor to the other
and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch
which was of the like work solomon made also an house for pharaohs
daughter whom he had taken to wife like unto this porch
all these were of costly stones according to the measures of
hewed stones sawed with saws within and without even from the
foundation unto the coping and so on the outside toward the great
court
and the foundation was of costly stones even great stones
stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits
and above were costly stones after the measures of hewed stones
and cedars
and the great court round about was with three rows of hewed
stones and a row of cedar beams both for the inner court of the
house of the lord and for the porch of the house
and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre
he was a widows son of the tribe of naphtali and his father was
a man of tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and
understanding and cunning to work all works in brass and he came to
king solomon and wrought all his work
for he cast two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high apiece
and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about
and he made two chapiters of molten brass to set upon the tops
of the pillars the height of the one chapiter was five cubits and
the height of the other chapiter was five cubits  and nets of
checker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters which were
upon the top of the pillars seven for the one chapiter and seven for
the other chapiter
and he made the pillars and two rows round about upon the one
network to cover the chapiters that were upon the top with
pomegranates and so did he for the other chapiter
and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of
lily work in the porch four cubits
and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
above over against the belly which was by the network and the
pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other
chapiter
and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple and he set
up the right pillar and called the name thereof jachin and he set up
the left pillar and called the name thereof boaz
and upon the top of the pillars was lily work so was the work of
the pillars finished
and he made a molten sea ten cubits from the one brim to the
other it was round all about and his height was five cubits and a
line of thirty cubits did compass it round about
and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing
it ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about the knops were
cast in two rows when it was cast
it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and
three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and
three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them
and all their hinder parts were inward
and it was an hand breadth thick and the brim thereof was
wrought like the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies it contained
two thousand baths
and he made ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one
base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height
of it
and the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders
and the borders were between the ledges  and on the borders that
were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon the
ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were
certain additions made of thin work
and every base had four brasen wheels and plates of brass and
the four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver were
undersetters molten at the side of every addition
and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit
but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base a cubit
and an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their
borders foursquare not round
and under the borders were four wheels and the axletrees of the
wheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit
and half a cubit
and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel
their axletrees and their naves and their felloes and their spokes
were all molten
and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base
and the undersetters were of the very base itself
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a
cubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the
borders thereof were of the same
for on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders
thereof he graved cherubims lions and palm trees according to the
proportion of every one and additions round about
after this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one
casting one measure and one size
then made he ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty
baths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the ten
bases one laver
and he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on
the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of
the house eastward over against the south
and hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basons so
hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king solomon for
the house of the lord  the two pillars and the two bowls of the
chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars and the two
networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the
top of the pillars  and four hundred pomegranates for the two
networks even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the
two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars  and the
ten bases and ten lavers on the bases  and one sea and twelve
oxen under the sea  and the pots and the shovels and the
basons and all these vessels which hiram made to king solomon for
the house of the lord were of bright brass
in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground
between succoth and zarthan
and solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were
exceeding many neither was the weight of the brass found out
and solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of
the lord the altar of gold and the table of gold whereupon the
shewbread was  and the candlesticks of pure gold five on the
right side and five on the left before the oracle with the flowers
and the lamps and the tongs of gold  and the bowls and the
snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure
gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner house
the most holy place and for the doors of the house to wit of the
temple
so was ended all the work that king solomon made for the house of
the lord and solomon brought in the things which david his father had
dedicated even the silver and the gold and the vessels did he put
among the treasures of the house of the lord
then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of
the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto
king solomon in jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of the
covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion
and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomon
at the feast in the month ethanim which is the seventh month
and all the elders of israel came and the priests took up the
ark
and they brought up the ark of the lord and the tabernacle of the
congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle
even those did the priests and the levites bring up
and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were
assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep
and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude
and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord
unto his place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place
even under the wings of the cherubims
for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of
the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof
above
and they drew out the staves that the ends of the staves were
seen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seen
without and there they are unto this day
there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which
moses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the
children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt
and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy
place that the cloud filled the house of the lord  so that the
priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the
glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord
then spake solomon the lord said that he would dwell in the
thick darkness
i have surely built thee an house to dwell in a settled place
for thee to abide in for ever
and the king turned his face about and blessed all the
congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood
and he said blessed be the lord god of israel which spake with
his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it
saying  since the day that i brought forth my people israel out
of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an
house that my name might be therein but i chose david to be over my
people israel
and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for
the name of the lord god of israel
and the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thine
heart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was in
thine heart
nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that
shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house unto my
name
and the lord hath performed his word that he spake and i am
risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of
israel as the lord promised and have built an house for the name of
the lord god of israel
and i have set there a place for the ark wherein is the covenant
of the lord which he made with our fathers when he brought them out
of the land of egypt
and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of
all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward
heaven  and he said lord god of israel there is no god like
thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and
mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart
who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thou
promisedst him thou spakest also with thy mouth and hast fulfilled
it with thine hand as it is this day
therefore now lord god of israel keep with thy servant david my
father that thou promisedst him saying there shall not fail thee a
man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel so that thy children
take heed to their way that they walk before me as thou hast walked
before me
and now o god of israel let thy word i pray thee be verified
which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father
but will god indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and
heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i
have builded   yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy
servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the
cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee to day
that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day even
toward the place of which thou hast said my name shall be there that
thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make
toward this place
and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy
people israel when they shall pray toward this place and hear thou
in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest forgive
if any man trespass against his neighbour and an oath be laid
upon him to cause him to swear and the oath come before thine altar
in this house  then hear thou in heaven and do and judge thy
servants condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head and
justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness
when thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy because
they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and
confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this
house  then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy
people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest
unto their fathers
when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have
sinned against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy
name and turn from their sin when thou afflictest them  then
hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy
people israel that thou teach them the good way wherein they should
walk and give rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people
for an inheritance
if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence blasting
mildew locust or if there be caterpiller if their enemy besiege
them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever
sickness there be  what prayer and supplication soever be made by
any man or by all thy people israel which shall know every man the
plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and do
and give to every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowest
for thou even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of
men  that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the
land which thou gavest unto our fathers
moreover concerning a stranger that is not of thy people israel
but cometh out of a far country for thy names sake  for they
shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy
stretched out arm when he shall come and pray toward this house
hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to all
that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth
may know thy name to fear thee as do thy people israel and that
they may know that this house which i have builded is called by thy
name
if thy people go out to battle against their enemy whithersoever
thou shalt send them and shall pray unto the lord toward the city
which thou hast chosen and toward the house that i have built for thy
name  then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their
supplication and maintain their cause
if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth not
and thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that
they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy far or near
yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they
were carried captives and repent and make supplication unto thee in
the land of them that carried them captives saying we have sinned
and have done perversely we have committed wickedness  and so
return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the
land of their enemies which led them away captive and pray unto thee
toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers the city
which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name
then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy
dwelling place and maintain their cause  and forgive thy people
that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein
they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before
them who carried them captive that they may have compassion on them
for they be thy people and thine inheritance which thou
broughtest forth out of egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron
that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant
and unto the supplication of thy people israel to hearken unto them
in all that they call for unto thee
for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the
earth to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of moses
thy servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt o lord
god
and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all
this prayer and supplication unto the lord he arose from before the
altar of the lord from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up
to heaven
and he stood and blessed all the congregation of israel with a
loud voice saying  blessed be the lord that hath given rest
unto his people israel according to all that he promised there hath
not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the
hand of moses his servant
the lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers let him
not leave us nor forsake us  that he may incline our hearts unto
him to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his
statutes and his judgments which he commanded our fathers
and let these my words wherewith i have made supplication before
the lord be nigh unto the lord our god day and night that he
maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israel
at all times as the matter shall require  that all the people of
the earth may know that the lord is god and that there is none else
let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god to
walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day
and the king and all israel with him offered sacrifice before
the lord
and solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which he
offered unto the lord two and twenty thousand oxen and an hundred
and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israel
dedicated the house of the lord
the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was
before the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings
and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the
brasen altar that was before the lord was too little to receive the
burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace
offerings
and at that time solomon held a feast and all israel with him a
great congregation from the entering in of hamath unto the river of
egypt before the lord our god seven days and seven days even
fourteen days
on the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the
king and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the
goodness that the lord had done for david his servant and for israel
his people
and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the
house of the lord and the kings house and all solomons desire
which he was pleased to do  that the lord appeared to solomon the
second time as he had appeared unto him at gibeon
and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy
supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this
house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine
eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually
and if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked in
integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that i
have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments
then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever
as i promised to david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a
man upon the throne of israel
but if ye shall at all turn from following me ye or your
children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i
have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them
then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given
them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast
out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all
people  and at this house which is high every one that passeth
by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why
hath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house   and
they shall answer because they forsook the lord their god who
brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt and have taken
hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them
therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years when solomon had
built the two houses the house of the lord and the kings house
now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar
trees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire that
then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee
and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had
given him and they pleased him not
and he said what cities are these which thou hast given me my
brother and he called them the land of cabul unto this day
and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold
and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised for
to build the house of the lord and his own house and millo and the
wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer
for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt
it with fire and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city and
given it for a present unto his daughter solomons wife
and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether  and
baalath and tadmor in the wilderness in the land  and all the
cities of store that solomon had and cities for his chariots and
cities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build in
jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion
and all the people that were left of the amorites hittites
perizzites hivites and jebusites which were not of the children of
israel  their children that were left after them in the land
whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy
upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day
but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen but
they were men of war and his servants and his princes and his
captains and rulers of his chariots and his horsemen
these were the chief of the officers that were over solomons
work five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people that
wrought in the work
but pharaohs daughter came up out of the city of david unto her
house which solomon had built for her then did he build millo
and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and
peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord and he
burnt incense upon the altar that was before the lord so he finished
the house
and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber which is
beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom
and hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had
knowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon
and they came to ophir and fetched from thence gold four
hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king solomon
and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon
concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard
questions
and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels
that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when
she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her
heart
and solomon told her all her questions there was not any thing
hid from the king which he told her not
and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomons wisdom and
the house that he had built  and the meat of his table and the
sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and
their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up
unto the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her
and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in
mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom
howbeit i believed not the words until i came and mine eyes had
seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and
prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard
happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand
continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom
blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee
on the throne of israel because the lord loved israel for ever
therefore made he thee king to do judgment and justice
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and
of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more
such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to
king solomon
and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir
brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious
stones
and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
the lord and for the kings house harps also and psalteries for
singers there came no such almug trees nor were seen unto this day
and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire
whatsoever she asked beside that which solomon gave her of his royal
bounty
so she turned and went to her own country she and her servants
now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six
hundred threescore and six talents of gold  beside that he had
of the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchants and of
all the kings of arabia and of the governors of the country
and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six
hundred shekels of gold went to one target
and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pound of
gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the
forest of lebanon
moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it
with the best gold
the throne had six steps and the top of the throne was round
behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat
and two lions stood beside the stays
and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom
and all king solomons drinking vessels were of gold and all
the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold
none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of
solomon
for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of
hiram once in three years came the navy of tharshish bringing gold
and silver ivory and apes and peacocks
so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches
and for wisdom
and all the earth sought to solomon to hear his wisdom which
god had put in his heart
and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and
vessels of gold and garments and armour and spices horses and
mules a rate year by year
and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had
a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen
whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots and with the king at
jerusalem
and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and
cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for
abundance
and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the
kings merchants received the linen yarn at a price
and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred
shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so for
all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria did they
bring them out by their means
but king solomon loved many strange women together with the
daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomites
zidonians and hittites  of the nations concerning which the lord
said unto the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neither
shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart
after their gods solomon clave unto these in love
and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred
concubines and his wives turned away his heart
for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned
away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with
the lord his god as was the heart of david his father
for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians
and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites
and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fully
after the lord as did david his father
then did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomination
of moab in the hill that is before jerusalem and for molech the
abomination of the children of ammon
and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt
incense and sacrificed unto their gods
and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned
from the lord god of israel which had appeared unto him twice
and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go
after other gods but he kept not that which the lord commanded
wherefore the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as this is done
of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which i
have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee and
will give it to thy servant
notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy
fathers sake but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son
howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but will give one
tribe to thy son for david my servants sake and for jerusalems sake
which i have chosen
and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon hadad the
edomite he was of the kings seed in edom
for it came to pass when david was in edom and joab the
captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain after he had
smitten every male in edom  for six months did joab remain
there with all israel until he had cut off every male in edom
that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his fathers servants with
him to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child
and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took
men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king
of egypt which gave him an house and appointed him victuals and
gave him land
and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he
gave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes
the queen
and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son whom
tahpenes weaned in pharaohs house and genubath was in pharaohs
household among the sons of pharaoh
and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers
and that joab the captain of the host was dead hadad said to pharaoh
let me depart that i may go to mine own country
then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lacked with me
that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and he
answered nothing howbeit let me go in any wise
and god stirred him up another adversary rezon the son of
eliadah which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah  and
he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band when david
slew them of zobah and they went to damascus and dwelt therein and
reigned in damascus
and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon
beside the mischief that hadad did and he abhorred israel and
reigned over syria
and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathite of zereda
solomons servant whose mothers name was zeruah a widow woman even
he lifted up his hand against the king
and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
king solomon built millo and repaired the breaches of the city of
david his father
and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and solomon
seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over
all the charge of the house of joseph
and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of
jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way
and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in
the field  and ahijah caught the new garment that was on him
and rent it in twelve pieces  and he said to jeroboam take thee
ten pieces for thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i will
rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribes
to thee  but he shall have one tribe for my servant davids
sake and for jerusalems sake the city which i have chosen out of
all the tribes of israel  because that they have forsaken me
and have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians chemosh
the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of ammon
and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine
eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did david his
father
howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but i
will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servants
sake whom i chose because he kept my commandments and my statutes
but i will take the kingdom out of his sons hand and will give
it unto thee even ten tribes
and unto his son will i give one tribe that david my servant
may have a light alway before me in jerusalem the city which i have
chosen me to put my name there
and i will take thee and thou shalt reign according to all that
thy soul desireth and shalt be king over israel
and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command
thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight to
keep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that i
will be with thee and build thee a sure house as i built for david
and will give israel unto thee
and i will for this afflict the seed of david but not for ever
solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam and jeroboam arose
and fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and was in egypt
until the death of solomon
and the rest of the acts of solomon and all that he did and
his wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon
and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel
was forty years
and solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city
of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead
and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem
to make him king
and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was yet
in egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of king
solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt  that they sent and called
him and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came and spake
unto rehoboam saying  thy father made our yoke grievous now
therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy
yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee
and he said unto them depart yet for three days then come again
to me and the people departed
and king rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before
solomon his father while he yet lived and said how do ye advise that
i may answer this people   and they spake unto him saying if
thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them
and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy
servants for ever
but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given
him and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him and
which stood before him  and he said unto them what counsel give
ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me saying make
the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter   and the
young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thus
shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying thy
father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus
shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my
fathers loins
and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke i will
add to your yoke my father hath chastised you with whips but i will
chastise you with scorpions
so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day
as the king had appointed saying come to me again the third day
and the king answered the people roughly and forsook the old
mens counsel that they gave him  and spake to them after the
counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy and
i will add to your yoke my father also chastised you with whips but
i will chastise you with scorpions
wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause
was from the lord that he might perform his saying which the lord
spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat
so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them
the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david
neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents o
israel now see to thine own house david so israel departed unto
their tents
but as for the children of israel which dwelt in the cities of
judah rehoboam reigned over them
then king rehoboam sent adoram who was over the tribute and
all israel stoned him with stones that he died therefore king
rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to
jerusalem
so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day
and it came to pass when all israel heard that jeroboam was
come again that they sent and called him unto the congregation and
made him king over all israel there was none that followed the house
of david but the tribe of judah only
and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he assembled all the
house of judah with the tribe of benjamin an hundred and fourscore
thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against the house
of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon
but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god saying
speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto
all the house of judah and benjamin and to the remnant of the people
saying  thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight
against your brethren the children of israel return every man to his
house for this thing is from me they hearkened therefore to the word
of the lord and returned to depart according to the word of the
lord
then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim and dwelt therein
and went out from thence and built penuel
and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to
the house of david  if this people go up to do sacrifice in the
house of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of this people
turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they
shall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah
whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold
and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem
behold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of
egypt
and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan
and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship
before the one even unto dan
and he made an house of high places and made priests of the
lowest of the people which were not of the sons of levi
and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the
fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah and
he offered upon the altar so did he in bethel sacrificing unto the
calves that he had made and he placed in bethel the priests of the
high places which he had made
so he offered upon the altar which he had made in bethel the
fifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he had
devised of his own heart and ordained a feast unto the children of
israel and he offered upon the altar and burnt incense
and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of
the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense
and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord and said
o altar altar thus saith the lord behold a child shall be born
unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer
the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and mens
bones shall be burnt upon thee
and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which
the lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes
that are upon it shall be poured out
and it came to pass when king jeroboam heard the saying of the
man of god which had cried against the altar in bethel that he put
forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him and his hand
which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it
in again to him
the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar
according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of
the lord
and the king answered and said unto the man of god intreat now
the face of the lord thy god and pray for me that my hand may be
restored me again and the man of god besought the lord and the
kings hand was restored him again and became as it was before
and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and
refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward
and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me half
thine house i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor
drink water in this place  for so was it charged me by the word
of the lord saying eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by
the same way that thou camest
so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came
to bethel
now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and his sons came and
told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in
bethel the words which he had spoken unto the king them they told
also to their father
and their father said unto them what way went he for his sons
had seen what way the man of god went which came from judah
and he said unto his sons saddle me the ass so they saddled
him the ass and he rode thereon  and went after the man of god
and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him art thou the
man of god that camest from judah and he said i am
then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread
and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee
neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place
for it was said to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat no
bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou
camest
he said unto him i am a prophet also as thou art and an angel
spake unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back with
thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he
lied unto him
so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and
drank water
and it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word of
the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back  and he
cried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith the
lord forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord and hast
not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee
but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of
the which the lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water
thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers
and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had
drunk that he saddled for him the ass to wit for the prophet whom
he had brought back
and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him
and his carcase was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion
also stood by the carcase
and behold men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the way
and the lion standing by the carcase and they came and told it in the
city where the old prophet dwelt
and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
thereof he said it is the man of god who was disobedient unto the
word of the lord therefore the lord hath delivered him unto the lion
which hath torn him and slain him according to the word of the lord
which he spake unto him
and he spake to his sons saying saddle me the ass and they
saddled him
and he went and found his carcase cast in the way and the ass
and the lion standing by the carcase the lion had not eaten the
carcase nor torn the ass
and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god and laid
it upon the ass and brought it back and the old prophet came to the
city to mourn and to bury him
and he laid his carcase in his own grave and they mourned over
him saying alas my brother   and it came to pass after he
had buried him that he spake to his sons saying when i am dead
then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried lay my
bones beside his bones  for the saying which he cried by the
word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the
houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria shall
surely come to pass
after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way but
made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places
whosoever would he consecrated him and he became one of the priests
of the high places
and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam even to
cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth
at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick
and jeroboam said to his wife arise i pray thee and disguise
thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam and get
thee to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet which told me
that i should be king over this people
and take with thee ten loaves and cracknels and a cruse of
honey and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of the
child
and jeroboams wife did so and arose and went to shiloh and
came to the house of ahijah but ahijah could not see for his eyes
were set by reason of his age
and the lord said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam
cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son for he is sick thus and
thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh in
that she shall feign herself to be another woman
and it was so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she
came in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam why
feignest thou thyself to be another for i am sent to thee with heavy
tidings
go tell jeroboam thus saith the lord god of israel forasmuch
as i exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over my
people israel  and rent the kingdom away from the house of david
and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant david who
kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do
that only which was right in mine eyes  but hast done evil above
all that were before thee for thou hast gone and made thee other
gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and hast cast me
behind thy back  therefore behold i will bring evil upon the
house of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth
against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and will
take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam as a man taketh away
dung till it be all gone
him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and
him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for the
lord hath spoken it
arise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thy
feet enter into the city the child shall die
and all israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of
jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some
good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam
moreover the lord shall raise him up a king over israel who
shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day but what even now
for the lord shall smite israel as a reed is shaken in the
water and he shall root up israel out of this good land which he
gave to their fathers and shall scatter them beyond the river
because they have made their groves provoking the lord to anger
and he shall give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam who
did sin and who made israel to sin
and jeroboams wife arose and departed and came to tirzah and
when she came to the threshold of the door the child died  and
they buried him and all israel mourned for him according to the word
of the lord which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah the
prophet
and the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he warred and how he
reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of israel
and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years
and he slept with his fathers and nadab his son reigned in his stead
and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah rehoboam was
forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned
seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord did choose out
of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers
name was naamah an ammonitess
and judah did evil in the sight of the lord and they provoked
him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed above all
that their fathers had done
for they also built them high places and images and groves on
every high hill and under every green tree
and there were also sodomites in the land and they did
according to all the abominations of the nations which the lord cast
out before the children of israel
and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that
shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem  and he took
away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the
kings house he even took away all and he took away all the shields
of gold which solomon had made
and king rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields and
committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard which kept
the door of the kings house
and it was so when the king went into the house of the lord
that the guard bare them and brought them back into the guard
chamber
now the rest of the acts of rehoboam and all that he did are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all their days
and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his
fathers in the city of david and his mothers name was naamah an
ammonitess and abijam his son reigned in his stead
now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat
reigned abijam over judah
three years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was
maachah the daughter of abishalom
and he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done
before him and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as
the heart of david his father
nevertheless for davids sake did the lord his god give him a
lamp in jerusalem to set up his son after him and to establish
jerusalem  because david did that which was right in the eyes of
the lord and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him
all the days of his life save only in the matter of uriah the
hittite
and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of
his life
now the rest of the acts of abijam and all that he did are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and
there was war between abijam and jeroboam
and abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the
city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead
and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel reigned asa
over judah
and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem and his
mothers name was maachah the daughter of abishalom
and asa did that which was right in the eyes of the lord as did
david his father
and he took away the sodomites out of the land and removed all
the idols that his fathers had made
and also maachah his mother even her he removed from being
queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa destroyed her
idol and burnt it by the brook kidron
but the high places were not removed nevertheless asas heart
was perfect with the lord all his days
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated and
the things which himself had dedicated into the house of the lord
silver and gold and vessels
and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all
their days
and baasha king of israel went up against judah and built
ramah that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king
of judah
then asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the
treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings
house and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king asa
sent them to benhadad the son of tabrimon the son of hezion king of
syria that dwelt at damascus saying  there is a league between
me and thee and between my father and thy father behold i have sent
unto thee a present of silver and gold come and break thy league with
baasha king of israel that he may depart from me
so benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of
the hosts which he had against the cities of israel and smote ijon
and dan and abelbethmaachah and all cinneroth with all the land of
naphtali
and it came to pass when baasha heard thereof that he left off
building of ramah and dwelt in tirzah
then king asa made a proclamation throughout all judah none was
exempted and they took away the stones of ramah and the timber
thereof wherewith baasha had builded and king asa built with them
geba of benjamin and mizpah
the rest of all the acts of asa and all his might and all that
he did and the cities which he built are they not written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of judah nevertheless in the time
of his old age he was diseased in his feet
and asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers
in the city of david his father and jehoshaphat his son reigned in
his stead
and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the
second year of asa king of judah and reigned over israel two years
and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way
of his father and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin
and baasha the son of ahijah of the house of issachar
conspired against him and baasha smote him at gibbethon which
belonged to the philistines for nadab and all israel laid siege to
gibbethon
even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasha slay him
and reigned in his stead
and it came to pass when he reigned that he smote all the
house of jeroboam he left not to jeroboam any that breathed until he
had destroyed him according unto the saying of the lord which he
spake by his servant ahijah the shilonite  because of the sins
of jeroboam which he sinned and which he made israel sin by his
provocation wherewith he provoked the lord god of israel to anger
now the rest of the acts of nadab and all that he did are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all
their days
in the third year of asa king of judah began baasha the son of
ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah twenty and four years
and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way
of jeroboam and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin
then the word of the lord came to jehu the son of hanani against
baasha saying  forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust and
made thee prince over my people israel and thou hast walked in the
way of jeroboam and hast made my people israel to sin to provoke me
to anger with their sins  behold i will take away the posterity
of baasha and the posterity of his house and will make thy house
like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat
him that dieth of baasha in the city shall the dogs eat and him
that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat
now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his
might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of israel   so baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in
tirzah and elah his son reigned in his stead
and also by the hand of the prophet jehu the son of hanani came
the word of the lord against baasha and against his house even for
all the evil that he did in the sight of the lord in provoking him to
anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of jeroboam
and because he killed him
in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah began elah the
son of baasha to reign over israel in tirzah two years
and his servant zimri captain of half his chariots conspired
against him as he was in tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house
of arza steward of his house in tirzah
and zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty
and seventh year of asa king of judah and reigned in his stead
and it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he sat
on his throne that he slew all the house of baasha he left him not
one that pisseth against a wall neither of his kinsfolks nor of his
friends
thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha according to the
word of the lord which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet
for all the sins of baasha and the sins of elah his son by
which they sinned and by which they made israel to sin in provoking
the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities
now the rest of the acts of elah and all that he did are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri
reign seven days in tirzah and the people were encamped against
gibbethon which belonged to the philistines
and the people that were encamped heard say zimri hath
conspired and hath also slain the king wherefore all israel made
omri the captain of the host king over israel that day in the camp
and omri went up from gibbethon and all israel with him and
they besieged tirzah
and it came to pass when zimri saw that the city was taken
that he went into the palace of the kings house and burnt the kings
house over him with fire and died
for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
lord in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did
to make israel to sin
now the rest of the acts of zimri and his treason that he
wrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of israel   then were the people of israel divided into
two parts half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath to
make him king and half followed omri
but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people
that followed tibni the son of ginath so tibni died and omri
reigned
in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to
reign over israel twelve years six years reigned he in tirzah
and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of
silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which
he built after the name of shemer owner of the hill samaria
but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the lord and did worse
than all that were before him
for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat and
in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin to provoke the lord god of
israel to anger with their vanities
now the rest of the acts of omri which he did and his might
that he shewed are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
the kings of israel   so omri slept with his fathers and was
buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his stead
and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began
ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri
reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years
and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above
all that were before him
and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to
walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife
jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians and went and
served baal and worshipped him
and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which
he had built in samaria
and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god
of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him
in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho he laid the
foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn and set up the gates
thereof in his youngest son segub according to the word of the lord
which he spake by joshua the son of nun
and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead
said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand
there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word
and the word of the lord came unto him saying  get thee
hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith
that is before jordan
and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have
commanded the ravens to feed thee there
so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he
went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan
and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and
bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook
and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up
because there had been no rain in the land
and the word of the lord came unto him saying  arise get
thee to zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold
i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee
so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate
of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks
and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water
in a vessel that i may drink
and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said
bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand
and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but
an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and
behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for
me and my son that we may eat it and die
and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said
but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and
after make for thee and for thy son
for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall
not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the
lord sendeth rain upon the earth
and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she
and he and her house did eat many days
and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil
fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah
and it came to pass after these things that the son of the
woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so
sore that there was no breath left in him
and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thou
man of god art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and
to slay my son   and he said unto her give me thy son and he
took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he
abode and laid him upon his own bed
and he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god hast thou
also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her
son   and he stretched himself upon the child three times and
cried unto the lord and said o lord my god i pray thee let this
childs soul come into him again
and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of the
child came into him again and he revived
and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the
chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah
said see thy son liveth
and the woman said to elijah now by this i know that thou art a
man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth
and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lord
came to elijah in the third year saying go shew thyself unto ahab
and i will send rain upon the earth
and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab and there was a sore
famine in samaria
and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house
now obadiah feared the lord greatly  for it was so when jezebel
cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took an hundred
prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and
water   and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto all
fountains of water and unto all brooks peradventure we may find
grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the
beasts
so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab
went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself
and as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he
knew him and fell on his face and said art thou that my lord
elijah   and he answered him i am go tell thy lord behold
elijah is here
and he said what have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy
servant into the hand of ahab to slay me   as the lord thy god
liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent
to seek thee and when they said he is not there he took an oath of
the kingdom and nation that they found thee not
and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here
and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that
the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not and so
when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay me
but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth
was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the
prophets of the lord how i hid an hundred men of the lords prophets
by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water   and now
thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he shall
slay me
and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i
stand i will surely shew myself unto him to day
so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to
meet elijah
and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto
him art thou he that troubleth israel   and he answered i have
not troubled israel but thou and thy fathers house in that ye have
forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed baalim
now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount
carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the
prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at jezebels table
so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the
prophets together unto mount carmel
and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye
between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal
then follow him and the people answered him not a word
then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a
prophet of the lord but baals prophets are four hundred and fifty
men
let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one
bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and
put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on
wood and put no fire under  and call ye on the name of your
gods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that
answereth by fire let him be god and all the people answered and
said it is well spoken
and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one
bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call
on the name of your gods but put no fire under
and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed
it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon
saying o baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that
answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made
and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said
cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing
or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be
awaked
and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with
knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them
and it came to pass when midday was past and they prophesied
until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there
was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded
and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all
the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord
that was broken down
and elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the
tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came
saying israel shall be thy name  and with the stones he built
an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the
altar as great as would contain two measures of seed
and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and
laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour
it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood
and he said do it the second time and they did it the second
time
and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time
and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the
trench also with water
and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of
abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art
god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all
these things at thy word
hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou
art the lord god and that thou hast turned their heart back again
then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt
sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up
the water that was in the trench
and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and
they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god
and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not
one of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them down
to the brook kishon and slew them there
and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for there
is a sound of abundance of rain
so ahab went up to eat and to drink and elijah went up to the
top of carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his
face between his knees  and said to his servant go up now look
toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is
nothing and he said go again seven times
and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold
there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a mans hand and he
said go up say unto ahab prepare thy chariot and get thee down
that the rain stop thee not
and it came to pass in the mean while that the heaven was black
with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab rode and
went to jezreel
and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his
loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel
and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how he
had slain all the prophets with the sword
then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the
gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of
one of them by to morrow about this time
and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came
to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there
but he himself went a days journey into the wilderness and came
and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that
he might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my life
for i am not better than my fathers
and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an
angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat
and he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coals
and a cruse of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid
him down again
and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched
him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for
thee
and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of
that meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god
and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold
the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest
thou here elijah   and he said i have been very jealous for
the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy
covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the
sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it
away
and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord
and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the
mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord
was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord
was not in the earthquake  and after the earthquake a fire but
the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice
and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in
his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave
and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou
here elijah   and he said i have been very jealous for the
lord god of hosts because the children of israel have forsaken thy
covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the
sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it
away
and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the
wilderness of damascus and when thou comest anoint hazael to be king
over syria  and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be
king over israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt
thou anoint to be prophet in thy room
and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of
hazael shall jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu
shall elisha slay
yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which
have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him
so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who
was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the
twelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him
and he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me i
pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow thee
and he said unto him go back again for what have i done to thee
and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew
them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and
gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went after
elijah and ministered unto him
and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host together
and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and
chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and warred against it
and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city and
said unto him thus saith benhadad  thy silver and thy gold is
mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine
and the king of israel answered and said my lord o king
according to thy saying i am thine and all that i have
and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh benhadad
saying although i have sent unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me
thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children  yet i
will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time and they
shall search thine house and the houses of thy servants and it shall
be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it in
their hand and take it away
then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and
said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he
sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and
for my gold and i denied him not
and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken not
unto him nor consent
wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad tell my lord
the king all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i
will do but this thing i may not do and the messengers departed and
brought him word again
and benhadad sent unto him and said the gods do so unto me
and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for
all the people that follow me
and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not him
that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off
and it came to pass when benhadad heard this message as he
was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto his
servants set yourselves in array and they set themselves in array
against the city
and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel
saying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude
behold i will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shalt
know that i am the lord
and ahab said by whom and he said thus saith the lord even
by the young men of the princes of the provinces then he said who
shall order the battle and he answered thou
then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces
and they were two hundred and thirty two and after them he numbered
all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand
and they went out at noon but benhadad was drinking himself
drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings
that helped him
and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
first and benhadad sent out and they told him saying there are men
come out of samaria
and he said whether they be come out for peace take them
alive or whether they be come out for war take them alive
so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of
the city and the army which followed them
and they slew every one his man and the syrians fled and
israel pursued them and benhadad the king of syria escaped on an
horse with the horsemen
and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and
chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter
and the prophet came to the king of israel and said unto him
go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the
return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee
and the servants of the king of syria said unto him their gods
are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let
us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger
than they
and do this thing take the kings away every man out of his
place and put captains in their rooms  and number thee an army
like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for
chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we
shall be stronger than they and he hearkened unto their voice and
did so
and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad
numbered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel
and the children of israel were numbered and were all present
and went against them and the children of israel pitched before them
like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country
and there came a man of god and spake unto the king of israel
and said thus saith the lord because the syrians have said the lord
is god of the hills but he is not god of the valleys therefore will
i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know
that i am the lord
and they pitched one over against the other seven days and so
it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the
children of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen in
one day
but the rest fled to aphek into the city and there a wall fell
upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left and benhadad
fled and came into the city into an inner chamber
and his servants said unto him behold now we have heard that
the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings let us i pray
thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out
to the king of israel peradventure he will save thy life
so they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their
heads and came to the king of israel and said thy servant benhadad
saith i pray thee let me live and he said is he yet alive he is
my brother
now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come
from him and did hastily catch it and they said thy brother
benhadad then he said go ye bring him then benhadad came forth to
him and he caused him to come up into the chariot
and benhadad said unto him the cities which my father took
from thy father i will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee
in damascus as my father made in samaria then said ahab i will send
thee away with this covenant so he made a covenant with him and sent
him away
and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
neighbour in the word of the lord smite me i pray thee and the man
refused to smite him
then said he unto him because thou hast not obeyed the voice of
the lord behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall
slay thee
and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew
him
then he found another man and said smite me i pray thee and
the man smote him so that in smiting he wounded him
so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and
disguised himself with ashes upon his face
and as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said
thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man
turned aside and brought a man unto me and said keep this man if
by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or
else thou shalt pay a talent of silver
and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone and the
king of israel said unto him so shall thy judgment be thyself hast
decided it
and he hasted and took the ashes away from his face and the
king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets
and he said unto him thus saith the lord because thou hast let
go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction
therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his
people
and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased
and came to samaria
and it came to pass after these things that naboth the
jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of
ahab king of samaria
and ahab spake unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that i
may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house
and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem
good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money
and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should
give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee
and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the
word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said i
will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down
upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread
but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy
spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread   and he said unto her
because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me
thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee
another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my
vineyard
and jezebel his wife said unto him dost thou now govern the
kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry
i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite
so she wrote letters in ahabs name and sealed them with his
seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were
in his city dwelling with naboth
and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set
naboth on high among the people  and set two men sons of
belial before him to bear witness against him saying thou didst
blaspheme god and the king and then carry him out and stone him
that he may die
and the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who were
the inhabitants in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them and as
it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them
they proclaimed a fast and set naboth on high among the people
and there came in two men children of belial and sat before
him and the men of belial witnessed against him even against naboth
in the presence of the people saying naboth did blaspheme god and
the king then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him
with stones that he died
then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is
dead
and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned
and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the
vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for
money for naboth is not alive but dead
and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead that
ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to
take possession of it
and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying
arise go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samaria
behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to
possess it
and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast
thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him
saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood
of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine
and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy and
he answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work
evil in the sight of the lord
behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy
posterity and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the
wall and him that is shut up and left in israel  and will make
thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the
house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou
hast provoked me to anger and made israel to sin
and of jezebel also spake the lord saying the dogs shall eat
jezebel by the wall of jezreel
him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him
that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat
but there was none like unto ahab which did sell himself to
work wickedness in the sight of the lord whom jezebel his wife
stirred up
and he did very abominably in following idols according to all
things as did the amorites whom the lord cast out before the children
of israel
and it came to pass when ahab heard those words that he rent
his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in
sackcloth and went softly
and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying
seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me because he
humbleth himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days but
in his sons days will i bring the evil upon his house
and they continued three years without war between syria and
israel
and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king
of judah came down to the king of israel
and the king of israel said unto his servants know ye that
ramoth in gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the
hand of the king of syria   and he said unto jehoshaphat wilt
thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead and jehoshaphat said to the
king of israel i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses
as thy horses
and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray
thee at the word of the lord to day
then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about
four hundred men and said unto them shall i go against ramothgilead
to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord
shall deliver it into the hand of the king
and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord
besides that we might enquire of him   and the king of israel
said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micaiah the son of imlah
by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he doth not
prophesy good concerning me but evil and jehoshaphat said let not
the king say so
then the king of israel called an officer and said hasten
hither micaiah the son of imlah
and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat
each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in the
entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied
before them
and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and he
said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou push the syrians
until thou have consumed them
and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to
ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the
kings hand
and the messenger that was gone to call micaiah spake unto him
saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the
king with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word of
one of them and speak that which is good
and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto
me that will i speak
so he came to the king and the king said unto him micaiah
shall we go against ramothgilead to battle or shall we forbear and
he answered him go and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into
the hand of the king
and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure thee
that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the
lord   and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the hills
as sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have no
master let them return every man to his house in peace
and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tell
thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil
and he said hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lord
sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on
his right hand and on his left
and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up
and fall at ramothgilead and one said on this manner and another
said on that manner
and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and
said i will persuade him
and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will go
forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets
and he said thou shalt persude him and prevail also go forth and
do so
now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the
mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil
concerning thee
but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near and smote micaiah
on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me
to speak unto thee   and micaiah said behold thou shalt see in
that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself
and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back
unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son
and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed
him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i
come in peace
and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hath
not spoken by me and he said hearken o people every one of you
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up
to ramothgilead
and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise
myself and enter into the battle but put thou on thy robes and the
king of israel disguised himself and went into the battle
but the king of syria commanded his thirty and two captains that
had rule over his chariots saying fight neither with small nor
great save only with the king of israel
and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw
jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of israel and they
turned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out
and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots perceived
that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from
pursuing him
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of
israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the
driver of his chariot turn thine hand and carry me out of the host
for i am wounded
and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in
his chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ran
out of the wound into the midst of the chariot
and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the
going down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man to
his own country
so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buried
the king in samaria
and one washed the chariot in the pool of samaria and the dogs
licked up his blood and they washed his armour according unto the
word of the lord which he spake
now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and the
ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
so ahab slept with his fathers and ahaziah his son reigned in
his stead
and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the
fourth year of ahab king of israel
jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to
reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his
mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi
and he walked in all the ways of asa his father he turned not
aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord
nevertheless the high places were not taken away for the people
offered and burnt incense yet in the high places
and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel
now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his might that he
shewed and how he warred are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of judah   and the remnant of the
sodomites which remained in the days of his father asa he took out
of the land
there was then no king in edom a deputy was king
jehoshaphat made ships of tharshish to go to ophir for gold but
they went not for the ships were broken at eziongeber
then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat let my
servants go with thy servants in the ships but jehoshaphat would not
and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his
fathers in the city of david his father and jehoram his son reigned
in his stead
ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria
the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned two
years over israel
and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way
of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of
jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin  for he served
baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the lord god of
israel according to all that his father had done
the second book of the kings
commonly called
the fourth book of the kings
then moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab
and ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that
was in samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto
them go enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shall
recover of this disease
but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite arise go
up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria and say unto them
is it not because there is not a god in israel that ye go to enquire
of baalzebub the god of ekron   now therefore thus saith the lord
thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but
shalt surely die and elijah departed
and when the messengers turned back unto him he said unto them
why are ye now turned back   and they said unto him there came a
man up to meet us and said unto us go turn again unto the king that
sent you and say unto him thus saith the lord is it not because
there is not a god in israel that thou sendest to enquire of
baalzebub the god of ekron therefore thou shalt not come down from
that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die
and he said unto them what manner of man was he which came up to
meet you and told you these words   and they answered him he was
an hairy man and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins and
he said it is elijah the tishbite
then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty and
he went up to him and behold he sat on the top of an hill and he
spake unto him thou man of god the king hath said come down
and elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty if i be a
man of god then let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and
thy fifty
and there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty
again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
fifty
and he answered and said unto him o man of god thus hath the king
said come down quickly
and elijah answered and said unto them if i be a man of god let
fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and the
fire of god came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty
and he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty
and the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees
before elijah and besought him and said unto him o man of god i
pray thee let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be
precious in thy sight
behold there came fire down from heaven and burnt up the two
captains of the former fifties with their fifties therefore let my
life now be precious in thy sight
and the angel of the lord said unto elijah go down with him be
not afraid of him and he arose and went down with him unto the king
and he said unto him thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast
sent messengers to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron is it not
because there is no god in israel to enquire of his word therefore
thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up but
shalt surely die
so he died according to the word of the lord which elijah had
spoken
and jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of jehoram the son
of jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son
now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   and
it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a
whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal
and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord
hath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth
and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to
bethel
and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to
elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away
thy master from thy head to day and he said yea i know it hold ye
your peace
and elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for the
lord hath sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as
thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho
and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came to elisha
and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy
master from thy head to day and he answered yea i know it hold ye
your peace
and elijah said unto him tarry i pray thee here for the lord
hath sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy
soul liveth i will not leave thee and they two went on
and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view
afar off and they two stood by jordan
and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the
waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they two
went over on dry ground
and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said
unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from
thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit
be upon me
and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou
see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if
not it shall not be so
and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that
behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and
parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into
heaven
and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the
chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more
and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces
he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went
back and stood by the bank of jordan  and he took the mantle of
elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is
the lord god of elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they
parted hither and thither and elisha went over
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at jericho
saw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha and they
came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him
and they said unto him behold now there be with thy servants
fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest
peradventure the spirit of the lord hath taken him up and cast him
upon some mountain or into some valley and he said ye shall not
send
and when they urged him till he was ashamed he said send they
sent therefore fifty men and they sought three days but found him
not
and when they came again to him for he tarried at jericho he
said unto them did i not say unto you go not   and the men of
the city said unto elisha behold i pray thee the situation of this
city is pleasant as my lord seeth but the water is naught and the
ground barren
and he said bring me a new cruse and put salt therein and they
brought it to him
and he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast the
salt in there and said thus saith the lord i have healed these
waters there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land
so the waters were healed unto this day according to the saying
of elisha which he spake
and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by
the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked
him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head
and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the
name of the lord and there came forth two she bears out of the wood
and tare forty and two children of them
and he went from thence to mount carmel and from thence he
returned to samaria
now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria
the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned twelve
years
and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord but not like his
father and like his mother for he put away the image of baal that
his father had made
nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of
nebat which made israel to sin he departed not therefrom
and mesha king of moab was a sheepmaster and rendered unto the
king of israel an hundred thousand lambs and an hundred thousand
rams with the wool
but it came to pass when ahab was dead that the king of moab
rebelled against the king of israel
and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time and numbered
all israel
and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the
king of moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against
moab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my people
as thy people and my horses as thy horses
and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way
through the wilderness of edom
so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of
edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there was
no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them
and the king of israel said alas that the lord hath called
these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab
but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord
that we may enquire of the lord by him and one of the king of
israels servants answered and said here is elisha the son of
shaphat which poured water on the hands of elijah
and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the
king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him
and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with
thee  get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of
thy mother
and the king of israel said unto him nay for the lord hath called
these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab
and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i
stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat
the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee
but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the
minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him
and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of
ditches
for thus saith the lord ye shall not see wind neither shall ye
see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water that ye may
drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts
and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will
deliver the moabites also into your hand
and ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city and
shall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar every
good piece of land with stones
and it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering was
offered that behold there came water by the way of edom and the
country was filled with water
and when all the moabites heard that the kings were come up to
fight against them they gathered all that were able to put on armour
and upward and stood in the border
and they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone upon the
water and the moabites saw the water on the other side as red as
blood  and they said this is blood the kings are surely slain
and they have smitten one another now therefore moab to the spoil
and when they came to the camp of israel the israelites rose up
and smote the moabites so that they fled before them but they went
forward smiting the moabites even in their country
and they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land
cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the
wells of water and felled all the good trees only in kirharaseth
left they the stones thereof howbeit the slingers went about it and
smote it
and when the king of moab saw that the battle was too sore for
him he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords to break
through even unto the king of edom but they could not
then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
stead and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall and there
was great indignation against israel and they departed from him and
returned to their own land
now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou
knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor is come
to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen
and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me what
hast thou in the house and she said thine handmaid hath not any
thing in the house save a pot of oil
then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
neighbours even empty vessels borrow not a few
and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
upon thy sons and shalt pour out into all those vessels and thou
shalt set aside that which is full
so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her
sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out
and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said
unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is
not a vessel more and the oil stayed
then she came and told the man of god and he said go sell the
oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest
and it fell on a day that elisha passed to shunem where was a
great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that
as oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread
and she said unto her husband behold now i perceive that this is
an holy man of god which passeth by us continually
let us make a little chamber i pray thee on the wall and let
us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a
candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn
in thither
and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into
the chamber and lay there
and he said to gehazi his servant call this shunammite and when
he had called her she stood before him
and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou hast been
careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee
wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the
host and she answered i dwell among mine own people
and he said what then is to be done for her and gehazi
answered verily she hath no child and her husband is old
and he said call her and when he had called her she stood in
the door
and he said about this season according to the time of life
thou shalt embrace a son and she said nay my lord thou man of god
do not lie unto thine handmaid
and the woman conceived and bare a son at that season that
elisha had said unto her according to the time of life
and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out
to his father to the reapers
and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to a
lad carry him to his mother
and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat
on her knees till noon and then died
and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god and
shut the door upon him and went out
and she called unto her husband and said send me i pray thee
one of the young men and one of the asses that i may run to the man
of god and come again
and he said wherefore wilt thou go to him to day it is neither
new moon nor sabbath and she said it shall be well
then she saddled an ass and said to her servant drive and go
forward slack not thy riding for me except i bid thee
so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel and it
came to pass when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to
gehazi his servant behold yonder is that shunammite  run now i
pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it
well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it
is well  and when she came to the man of god to the hill she
caught him by the feet but gehazi came near to thrust her away and
the man of god said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her
and the lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me
then she said did i desire a son of my lord did i not say do
not deceive me   then he said to gehazi gird up thy loins and
take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man
salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay
my staff upon the face of the child
and the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and as thy
soul liveth i will not leave thee and he arose and followed her
and gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the
face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore
he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not
awaked
and when elisha was come into the house behold the child was
dead and laid upon his bed
he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and
prayed unto the lord
and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon
his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands
and stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed
warm
then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went
up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times
and the child opened his eyes
and he called gehazi and said call this shunammite so he
called her and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy
son
then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the
ground and took up her son and went out
and elisha came again to gilgal and there was a dearth in the
land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he
said unto his servant set on the great pot and seethe pottage for
the sons of the prophets
and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild
vine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full and came and
shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not
so they poured out for the men to eat and it came to pass as
they were eating of the pottage that they cried out and said o thou
man of god there is death in the pot and they could not eat thereof
but he said then bring meal and he cast it into the pot and he
said pour out for the people that they may eat and there was no
harm in the pot
and there came a man from baalshalisha and brought the man of
god bread of the firstfruits twenty loaves of barley and full ears
of corn in the husk thereof and he said give unto the people that
they may eat
and his servitor said what should i set this before an hundred
men  he said again give the people that they may eat for thus
saith the lord they shall eat and shall leave thereof
so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof
according to the word of the lord
now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria was a great
man with his master and honourable because by him the lord had given
deliverance unto syria he was also a mighty man in valour but he was
a leper
and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away
captive out of the land of israel a little maid and she waited on
naamans wife
and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were with the
prophet that is in samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy
and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the
maid that is of the land of israel
and the king of syria said go to go and i will send a letter
unto the king of israel and he departed and took with him ten
talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of
raiment
and he brought the letter to the king of israel saying now when
this letter is come unto thee behold i have therewith sent naaman my
servant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy
and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter
that he rent his clothes and said am i god to kill and to make
alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his
leprosy wherefore consider i pray you and see how he seeketh a
quarrel against me
and it was so when elisha the man of god had heard that the king
of israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying
wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and he
shall know that there is a prophet in israel
so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at
the door of the house of elisha
and elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in
jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou
shalt be clean
but naaman was wroth and went away and said behold i thought
he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the
lord his god and strike his hand over the place and recover the
leper
are not abana and pharpar rivers of damascus better than all
the waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so he
turned and went away in a rage
and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my
father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou
not have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee wash
and be clean   then went he down and dipped himself seven times
in jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh
came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean
and he returned to the man of god he and all his company and
came and stood before him and he said behold now i know that there
is no god in all the earth but in israel now therefore i pray thee
take a blessing of thy servant
but he said as the lord liveth before whom i stand i will
receive none and he urged him to take it but he refused
and naaman said shall there not then i pray thee be given to
thy servant two mules burden of earth for thy servant will
henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods
but unto the lord
in this thing the lord pardon thy servant that when my master
goeth into the house of rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my
hand and i bow myself in the house of rimmon when i bow down myself
in the house of rimmon the lord pardon thy servant in this thing
and he said unto him go in peace so he departed from him a
little way
but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said behold
my master hath spared naaman this syrian in not receiving at his
hands that which he brought but as the lord liveth i will run after
him and take somewhat of him
so gehazi followed after naaman and when naaman saw him running
after him he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said is
all well   and he said all is well my master hath sent me
saying behold even now there be come to me from mount ephraim two
young men of the sons of the prophets give them i pray thee a
talent of silver and two changes of garments
and naaman said be content take two talents and he urged him
and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of
garments and laid them upon two of his servants and they bare them
before him
and when he came to the tower he took them from their hand and
bestowed them in the house and he let the men go and they departed
but he went in and stood before his master and elisha said unto
him whence comest thou gehazi and he said thy servant went no
whither
and he said unto him went not mine heart with thee when the man
turned again from his chariot to meet thee is it a time to receive
money and to receive garments and oliveyards and vineyards and
sheep and oxen and menservants and maidservants   the leprosy
therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for
ever and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow
and the sons of the prophets said unto elisha behold now the
place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us
let us go we pray thee unto jordan and take thence every man a
beam and let us make us a place there where we may dwell and he
answered go ye
and one said be content i pray thee and go with thy servants
and he answered i will go
so he went with them and when they came to jordan they cut down
wood
but as one was felling a beam the axe head fell into the water
and he cried and said alas master for it was borrowed
and the man of god said where fell it and he shewed him the
place
and he cut down a stick and cast it in thither and the iron did
swim
therefore said he take it up to thee and he put out his hand
and took it
then the king of syria warred against israel and took counsel
with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp
and the man of god sent unto the king of israel saying beware
that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are come
down
and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god
told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor
twice
therefore the heart of the king of syria was sore troubled for
this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye
not shew me which of us is for the king of israel   and one of
his servants said none my lord o king but elisha the prophet that
is in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest
in thy bedchamber
and he said go and spy where he is that i may send and fetch
him
and it was told him saying behold he is in dothan
therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host
and they came by night and compassed the city about
and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone
forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and
chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we
do   and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more
than they that be with them
and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes
that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he
saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire
round about elisha
and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and
said smite this people i pray thee with blindness and he smote
them with blindness according to the word of elisha
and elisha said unto them this is not the way neither is this
the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek but
he led them to samaria
and it came to pass when they were come into samaria that
elisha said lord open the eyes of these men that they may see and
the lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in
the midst of samaria
and the king of israel said unto elisha when he saw them my
father shall i smite them shall i smite them   and he answered
thou shalt not smite them wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast
taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and water
before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master
and he prepared great provision for them and when they had eaten
and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master so the
bands of syria came no more into the land of israel
and it came to pass after this that benhadad king of syria
gathered all his host and went up and besieged samaria
and there was a great famine in samaria and behold they
besieged it until an asss head was sold for fourscore pieces of
silver and the fourth part of a cab of doves dung for five pieces of
silver
and as the king of israel was passing by upon the wall there
cried a woman unto him saying help my lord o king
and he said if the lord do not help thee whence shall i help
thee  out of the barnfloor or out of the winepress   and the
king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered this woman
said unto me give thy son that we may eat him to day and we will
eat my son to morrow
so we boiled my son and did eat him and i said unto her on the
next day give thy son that we may eat him and she hath hid her son
and it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman
that he rent his clothes and he passed by upon the wall and the
people looked and behold he had sackcloth within upon his flesh
then he said god do so and more also to me if the head of
elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day
but elisha sat in his house and the elders sat with him and the
king sent a man from before him but ere the messenger came to him he
said to the elders see ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to
take away mine head look when the messenger cometh shut the door
and hold him fast at the door is not the sound of his masters feet
behind him   and while he yet talked with them behold the
messenger came down unto him and he said behold this evil is of the
lord what should i wait for the lord any longer   then elisha
said hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord to morrow
about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel
and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria
then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god
and said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven might this
thing be  and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but
shalt not eat thereof
and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate
and they said one to another why sit we here until we die   if we
say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and
we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now
therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the syrians if they
save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die
and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the
syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of
syria behold there was no man there
for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of
chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and
they said one to another lo the king of israel hath hired against us
the kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to come
upon us
wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their
tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and
fled for their life
and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp they
went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried thence silver
and gold and raiment and went and hid it and came again and
entered into another tent and carried thence also and went and hid
it
then they said one to another we do not well this day is a day
of good tidings and we hold our peace if we tarry till the morning
light some mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we
may go and tell the kings household
so they came and called unto the porter of the city and they
told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold
there was no man there neither voice of man but horses tied and
asses tied and the tents as they were
and he called the porters and they told it to the kings house
within
and the king arose in the night and said unto his servants i
will now shew you what the syrians have done to us they know that we
be hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves
in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall catch
them alive and get into the city
and one of his servants answered and said let some take i pray
thee five of the horses that remain which are left in the city
behold they are as all the multitude of israel that are left in it
behold i say they are even as all the multitude of the israelites
that are consumed and let us send and see
they took therefore two chariot horses and the king sent after
the host of the syrians saying go and see
and they went after them unto jordan and lo all the way was
full of garments and vessels which the syrians had cast away in their
haste and the messengers returned and told the king
and the people went out and spoiled the tents of the syrians so
a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of
barley for a shekel according to the word of the lord
and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have
the charge of the gate and the people trode upon him in the gate and
he died as the man of god had said who spake when the king came down
to him
and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king
saying two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine
flour for a shekel shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of
samaria  and that lord answered the man of god and said now
behold if the lord should make windows in heaven might such a thing
be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt
not eat thereof
and so it fell out unto him for the people trode upon him in the
gate and he died
then spake elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to
life saying arise and go thou and thine household and sojourn
wheresoever thou canst sojourn for the lord hath called for a famine
and it shall also come upon the land seven years
and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of god
and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the
philistines seven years
and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman
returned out of the land of the philistines and she went forth to cry
unto the king for her house and for her land
and the king talked with gehazi the servant of the man of god
saying tell me i pray thee all the great things that elisha hath
done
and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had
restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he
had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her
land and gehazi said my lord o king this is the woman and this is
her son whom elisha restored to life
and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king
appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was
hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the
land even until now
and elisha came to damascus and benhadad the king of syria was
sick and it was told him saying the man of god is come hither
and the king said unto hazael take a present in thine hand and
go meet the man of god and enquire of the lord by him saying shall
i recover of this disease   so hazael went to meet him and took a
present with him even of every good thing of damascus forty camels
burden and came and stood before him and said thy son benhadad king
of syria hath sent me to thee saying shall i recover of this
disease   and elisha said unto him go say unto him thou mayest
certainly recover howbeit the lord hath shewed me that he shall
surely die
and he settled his countenance stedfastly until he was ashamed
and the man of god wept
and hazael said why weepeth my lord and he answered because i
know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of israel their
strong holds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slay
with the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their women
with child
and hazael said but what is thy servant a dog that he should
do this great thing and elisha answered the lord hath shewed me that
thou shalt be king over syria
so he departed from elisha and came to his master who said to
him what said elisha to thee and he answered he told me that thou
shouldest surely recover
and it came to pass on the morrow that he took a thick cloth
and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died
and hazael reigned in his stead
and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel
jehoshaphat being then king of judah jehoram the son of je hoshaphat
king of judah began to reign
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he
reigned eight years in jerusalem
and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house
of ahab for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in the
sight of the lord
yet the lord would not destroy judah for david his servants
sake as he promised him to give him alway a light and to his
children
in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made
a king over themselves
so joram went over to zair and all the chariots with him and he
rose by night and smote the edomites which compassed him about and
the captains of the chariots and the people fled into their tents
yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day
then libnah revolted at the same time
and the rest of the acts of joram and all that he did are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
and joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in
the city of david and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead
in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel did
ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign
two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and
he reigned one year in jerusalem and his mothers name was athaliah
the daughter of omri king of israel
and he walked in the way of the house of ahab and did evil in
the sight of the lord as did the house of ahab for he was the son in
law of the house of ahab
and he went with joram the son of ahab to the war against hazael
king of syria in ramothgilead and the syrians wounded joram
and king joram went back to be healed in jezreel of the wounds
which the syrians had given him at ramah when he fought against
hazael king of syria and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah
went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was
sick
and elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets
and said unto him gird up thy loins and take this box of oil in
thine hand and go to ramothgilead  and when thou comest thither
look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go
in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an
inner chamber  then take the box of oil and pour it on his head
and say thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel
then open the door and flee and tarry not
so the young man even the young man the prophet went to
ramothgilead
and when he came behold the captains of the host were sitting
and he said i have an errand to thee o captain and jehu said unto
which of all us and he said to thee o captain
and he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil on
his head and said unto him thus saith the lord god of israel i have
anointed thee king over the people of the lord even over israel
and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master that i may
avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the
servants of the lord at the hand of jezebel
for the whole house of ahab shall perish and i will cut off from
ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and
left in israel  and i will make the house of ahab like the house
of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of
ahijah  and the dogs shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel
and there shall be none to bury her and he opened the door and fled
then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one said
unto him is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee and he
said unto them ye know the man and his communication
and they said it is false tell us now and he said thus and
thus spake he to me saying thus saith the lord i have anointed thee
king over israel
then they hasted and took every man his garment and put it
under him on the top of the stairs and blew with trumpets saying
jehu is king
so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired
against joram now joram had kept ramothgilead he and all israel
because of hazael king of syria
but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds
which the syrians had given him when he fought with hazael king of
syria  and jehu said if it be your minds then let none go forth
nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel
so jehu rode in a chariot and went to jezreel for joram lay
there
and ahaziah king of judah was come down to see joram
and there stood a watchman on the tower in jezreel and he spied
the company of jehu as he came and said i see a company and joram
said take an horseman and send to meet them and let him say is it
peace   so there went one on horseback to meet him and said
thus saith the king is it peace and jehu said what hast thou to do
with peace turn thee behind me and the watchman told saying the
messenger came to them but he cometh not again
then he sent out a second on horseback which came to them and
said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu answered what hast
thou to do with peace turn thee behind me
and the watchman told saying he came even unto them and cometh
not again and the driving is like the driving of jehu the son of
nimshi for he driveth furiously
and joram said make ready and his chariot was made ready and
joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in his
chariot and they went out against jehu and met him in the portion of
naboth the jezreelite
and it came to pass when joram saw jehu that he said is it
peace jehu and he answered what peace so long as the whoredoms of
thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many   and joram
turned his hands and fled and said to ahaziah there is treachery o
ahaziah
and jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote jehoram
between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk
down in his chariot
then said jehu to bidkar his captain take up and cast him in
the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite for remember how
that when i and thou rode together after ahab his father the lord
laid this burden upon him  surely i have seen yesterday the blood
of naboth and the blood of his sons saith the lord and i will
requite thee in this plat saith the lord now therefore take and cast
him into the plat of ground according to the word of the lord
but when ahaziah the king of judah saw this he fled by the way
of the garden house and jehu followed after him and said smite him
also in the chariot and they did so at the going up to gur which is
by ibleam
and he fled to megiddo and died there
and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem and
buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of david
and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah
to reign over judah
and when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it and she
painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window
and as jehu entered in at the gate she said had zimri peace
who slew his master   and he lifted up his face to the window
and said who is on my side  who and there looked out to him two or
three eunuchs
and he said throw her down so they threw her down and some of
her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he trode
her under foot
and when he was come in he did eat and drink and said go see
now this cursed woman and bury her for she is a kings daughter
and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the
skull and the feet and the palms of her hands
wherefore they came again and told him and he said this is the
word of the lord which he spake by his servant elijah the tishbite
saying in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel
and the carcase of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the
field in the portion of jezreel so that they shall not say this is
jezebel
and ahab had seventy sons in samaria and jehu wrote letters and
sent to samaria unto the rulers of jezreel to the elders and to
them that brought up ahabs children saying  now as soon as this
letter cometh to you seeing your masters sons are with you and
there are with you chariots and horses a fenced city also and
armour  look even out the best and meetest of your masters sons
and set him on his fathers throne and fight for your masters house
but they were exceedingly afraid and said behold two kings
stood not before him how then shall we stand   and he that was
over the house and he that was over the city the elders also and
the bringers up of the children sent to jehu saying we are thy
servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make any
king do thou that which is good in thine eyes
then he wrote a letter the second time to them saying if ye be
mine and if ye will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of the
men your masters sons and come to me to jezreel by to morrow this
time now the kings sons being seventy persons were with the great
men of the city which brought them up
and it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took
the kings sons and slew seventy persons and put their heads in
baskets and sent him them to jezreel
and there came a messenger and told him saying they have
brought the heads of the kings sons and he said lay ye them in two
heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning
and it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood
and said to all the people ye be righteous behold i conspired
against my master and slew him but who slew all these   know
now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the
lord which the lord spake concerning the house of ahab for the lord
hath done that which he spake by his servant elijah
so jehu slew all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel
and all his great men and his kinsfolks and his priests until he
left him none remaining
and he arose and departed and came to samaria and as he was at
the shearing house in the way  jehu met with the brethren of
ahaziah king of judah and said who are ye and they answered we are
the brethren of ahaziah and we go down to salute the children of the
king and the children of the queen
and he said take them alive and they took them alive and slew
them at the pit of the shearing house even two and forty men neither
left he any of them
and when he was departed thence he lighted on jehonadab the son
of rechab coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him is
thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart and jehonadab
answered it is if it be give me thine hand and he gave him his
hand and he took him up to him into the chariot
and he said come with me and see my zeal for the lord so they
made him ride in his chariot
and when he came to samaria he slew all that remained unto ahab
in samaria till he had destroyed him according to the saying of the
lord which he spake to elijah
and jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them
ahab served baal a little but jehu shall serve him much
now therefore call unto me all the prophets of baal all his
servants and all his priests let none be wanting for i have a great
sacrifice to do to baal whosoever shall be wanting he shall not
live but jehu did it in subtilty to the intent that he might destroy
the worshippers of baal
and jehu said proclaim a solemn assembly for baal and they
proclaimed it
and jehu sent through all israel and all the worshippers of
baal came so that there was not a man left that came not and they
came into the house of baal and the house of baal was full from one
end to another
and he said unto him that was over the vestry bring forth
vestments for all the worshippers of baal and he brought them forth
vestments
and jehu went and jehonadab the son of rechab into the house
of baal and said unto the worshippers of baal search and look that
there be here with you none of the servants of the lord but the
worshippers of baal only
and when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings
jehu appointed fourscore men without and said if any of the men whom
i have brought into your hands escape he that letteth him go his
life shall be for the life of him
and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of offering
the burnt offering that jehu said to the guard and to the captains
go in and slay them let none come forth and they smote them with
the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out
and went to the city of the house of baal
and they brought forth the images out of the house of baal and
burned them
and they brake down the image of baal and brake down the house
of baal and made it a draught house unto this day
thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel
howbeit from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made
israel to sin jehu departed not from after them to wit the golden
calves that were in bethel and that were in dan
and the lord said unto jehu because thou hast done well in
executing that which is right in mine eyes and hast done unto the
house of ahab according to all that was in mine heart thy children of
the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel
but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the lord god of
israel with all his heart for he departed not from the sins of
jeroboam which made israel to sin
in those days the lord began to cut israel short and hazael
smote them in all the coasts of israel  from jordan eastward
all the land of gilead the gadites and the reubenites and the
manassites from aroer which is by the river arnon even gilead and
bashan
now the rest of the acts of jehu and all that he did and all
his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of israel   and jehu slept with his fathers and they
buried him in samaria and jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead
and the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria was twenty
and eight years
and when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was
dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal
but jehosheba the daughter of king joram sister of ahaziah
took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the kings
sons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse in
the bedchamber from athaliah so that he was not slain
and he was with her hid in the house of the lord six years and
athaliah did reign over the land
and the seventh year jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
hundreds with the captains and the guard and brought them to him
into the house of the lord and made a covenant with them and took an
oath of them in the house of the lord and shewed them the kings son
and he commanded them saying this is the thing that ye shall
do a third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be
keepers of the watch of the kings house  and a third part shall
be at the gate of sur and a third part at the gate behind the guard
so shall ye keep the watch of the house that it be not broken down
and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath even they
shall keep the watch of the house of the lord about the king
and ye shall compass the king round about every man with his
weapons in his hand and he that cometh within the ranges let him be
slain and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in
and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men
that were to come in on the sabbath with them that should go out on
the sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest
and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
davids spears and shields that were in the temple of the lord
and the guard stood every man with his weapons in his hand
round about the king from the right corner of the temple to the left
corner of the temple along by the altar and the temple
and he brought forth the kings son and put the crown upon him
and gave him the testimony and they made him king and anointed him
and they clapped their hands and said god save the king
and when athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
people she came to the people into the temple of the lord
and when she looked behold the king stood by a pillar as the
manner was and the princes and the trumpeters by the king and all
the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets and athaliah
rent her clothes and cried treason treason
but jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds
the officers of the host and said unto them have her forth without
the ranges and him that followeth her kill with the sword for the
priest had said let her not be slain in the house of the lord
and they laid hands on her and she went by the way by the which
the horses came into the kings house and there was she slain
and jehoiada made a covenant between the lord and the king and
the people that they should be the lords people between the king
also and the people
and all the people of the land went into the house of baal and
brake it down his altars and his images brake they in pieces
thoroughly and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars and
the priest appointed officers over the house of the lord
and he took the rulers over hundreds and the captains and the
guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king
from the house of the lord and came by the way of the gate of the
guard to the kings house and he sat on the throne of the kings
and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was in
quiet and they slew athaliah with the sword beside the kings house
seven years old was jehoash when he began to reign
in the seventh year of jehu jehoash began to reign and forty
years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was zibiah of
beersheba
and jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all
his days wherein jehoiada the priest instructed him
but the high places were not taken away the people still
sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places
and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the dedicated
things that is brought into the house of the lord even the money of
every one that passeth the account the money that every man is set
at and all the money that cometh into any mans heart to bring into
the house of the lord  let the priests take it to them every man
of his acquaintance and let them repair the breaches of the house
wheresoever any breach shall be found
but it was so that in the three and twentieth year of king
jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house
then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest and the other
priests and said unto them why repair ye not the breaches of the
house now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance but
deliver it for the breaches of the house
and the priests consented to receive no more money of the people
neither to repair the breaches of the house
but jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid
of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh
into the house of the lord and the priests that kept the door put
therein all the money that was brought into the house of the lord
and it was so when they saw that there was much money in the
chest that the kings scribe and the high priest came up and they
put up in bags and told the money that was found in the house of the
lord
and they gave the money being told into the hands of them that
did the work that had the oversight of the house of the lord and
they laid it out to the carpenters and builders that wrought upon the
house of the lord  and to masons and hewers of stone and to
buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the
lord and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it
howbeit there were not made for the house of the lord bowls of
silver snuffers basons trumpets any vessels of gold or vessels of
silver of the money that was brought into the house of the lord
but they gave that to the workmen and repaired therewith the
house of the lord
moreover they reckoned not with the men into whose hand they
delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen for they dealt
faithfully
the trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house
of the lord it was the priests
then hazael king of syria went up and fought against gath and
took it and hazael set his face to go up to jerusalem
and jehoash king of judah took all the hallowed things that
jehoshaphat and jehoram and ahaziah his fathers kings of judah
had dedicated and his own hallowed things and all the gold that was
found in the treasures of the house of the lord and in the kings
house and sent it to hazael king of syria and he went away from
jerusalem
and the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
and his servants arose and made a conspiracy and slew joash in
the house of millo which goeth down to silla
for jozachar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son of
shomer his servants smote him and he died and they buried him with
his fathers in the city of david and amaziah his son reigned in his
stead
in the three and twentieth year of joash the son of ahaziah king
of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu began to reign over israel in
samaria and reigned seventeen years
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and
followed the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which made israel to
sin he departed not therefrom
and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he
delivered them into the hand of hazael king of syria and into the
hand of benhadad the son of hazael all their days
and jehoahaz besought the lord and the lord hearkened unto him
for he saw the oppression of israel because the king of syria
oppressed them
and the lord gave israel a saviour so that they went out from
under the hand of the syrians and the children of israel dwelt in
their tents as beforetime
nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
jeroboam who made israel sin but walked therein and there remained
the grove also in samaria   neither did he leave of the people
to jehoahaz but fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand
footmen for the king of syria had destroyed them and had made them
like the dust by threshing
now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz and all that he did and
his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of israel   and jehoahaz slept with his fathers and they
buried him in samaria and joash his son reigned in his stead
in the thirty and seventh year of joash king of judah began
jehoash the son of jehoahaz to reign over israel in samaria and
reigned sixteen years
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he
departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made
israel sin but he walked therein
and the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did and his
might wherewith he fought against amaziah king of judah are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
and joash slept with his fathers and jeroboam sat upon his throne
and joash was buried in samaria with the kings of israel
now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and
joash the king of israel came down unto him and wept over his face
and said o my father my father the chariot of israel and the
horsemen thereof
and elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto
him bow and arrows
and he said to the king of israel put thine hand upon the bow
and he put his hand upon it and elisha put his hands upon the kings
hands
and he said open the window eastward and he opened it then
elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the lords
deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from syria for thou shalt
smite the syrians in aphek till thou have consumed them
and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said unto
the king of israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice and
stayed
and the man of god was wroth with him and said thou shouldest
have smitten five or six times then hadst thou smitten syria till
thou hadst consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice
and elisha died and they buried him and the bands of the
moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year
and it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold
they spied a band of men and they cast the man into the sepulchre of
elisha and when the man was let down and touched the bones of
elisha he revived and stood up on his feet
but hazael king of syria oppressed israel all the days of
jehoahaz
and the lord was gracious unto them and had compassion on them
and had respect unto them because of his covenant with abraham
isaac and jacob and would not destroy them neither cast he them
from his presence as yet
so hazael king of syria died and benhadad his son reigned in
his stead
and jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
benhadad the son of hazael the cities which he had taken out of the
hand of jehoahaz his father by war three times did joash beat him
and recovered the cities of israel
in the second year of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel
reigned amaziah the son of joash king of judah
he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and
reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers name was
jehoaddan of jerusalem
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord yet not
like david his father he did according to all things as joash his
father did
howbeit the high places were not taken away as yet the people
did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places
and it came to pass as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his
hand that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father
but the children of the murderers he slew not according unto
that which is written in the book of the law of moses wherein the
lord commanded saying the fathers shall not be put to death for the
children nor the children be put to death for the fathers but every
man shall be put to death for his own sin
he slew of edom in the valley of salt ten thousand and took
selah by war and called the name of it joktheel unto this day
then amaziah sent messengers to jehoash the son of jehoahaz son
of jehu king of israel saying come let us look one another in the
face
and jehoash the king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah
saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in
lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed
by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle
thou hast indeed smitten edom and thine heart hath lifted thee
up glory of this and tarry at home for why shouldest thou meddle to
thy hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee
but amaziah would not hear therefore jehoash king of israel
went up and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the
face at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah
and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled
every man to their tents
and jehoash king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son
of jehoash the son of ahaziah at bethshemesh and came to jerusalem
and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim unto the
corner gate four hundred cubits
and he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that
were found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the
kings house and hostages and returned to samaria
now the rest of the acts of jehoash which he did and his might
and how he fought with amaziah king of judah are they not written in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel   and jehoash
slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria with the kings of
israel and jeroboam his son reigned in his stead
and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death
of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years
and the rest of the acts of amaziah are they not written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of judah   now they made a
conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they
sent after him to lachish and slew him there
and they brought him on horses and he was buried at jerusalem
with his fathers in the city of david
and all the people of judah took azariah which was sixteen
years old and made him king instead of his father amaziah
he built elath and restored it to judah after that the king
slept with his fathers
in the fifteenth year of amaziah the son of joash king of judah
jeroboam the son of joash king of israel began to reign in samaria
and reigned forty and one years
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he
departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made
israel to sin
he restored the coast of israel from the entering of hamath unto
the sea of the plain according to the word of the lord god of israel
which he spake by the hand of his servant jonah the son of amittai
the prophet which was of gathhepher
for the lord saw the affliction of israel that it was very
bitter for there was not any shut up nor any left nor any helper
for israel
and the lord said not that he would blot out the name of israel
from under heaven but he saved them by the hand of jeroboam the son
of joash
now the rest of the acts of jeroboam and all that he did and
his might how he warred and how he recovered damascus and hamath
which belonged to judah for israel are they not written in the book
of the chronicles of the kings of israel   and jeroboam slept
with his fathers even with the kings of israel and zachariah his son
reigned in his stead
in the twenty and seventh year of jeroboam king of israel began
azariah son of amaziah king of judah to reign
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned
two and fifty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jecholiah
of jerusalem

according to all that his father amaziah had done  save that the
high places were not removed the people sacrificed and burnt incense
still on the high places
and the lord smote the king so that he was a leper unto the day
of his death and dwelt in a several house and jotham the kings son
was over the house judging the people of the land

fathers in the city of david and jotham his son reigned in his stead

zachariah the son of jeroboam reign over israel in samaria six months
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as his
fathers had done he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of
nebat who made israel to sin
and shallum the son of jabesh conspired against him and smote
him before the people and slew him and reigned in his stead
and the rest of the acts of zachariah behold they are written
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
this was the word of the lord which he spake unto jehu saying
thy sons shall sit on the throne of israel unto the fourth generation
and so it came to pass
shallum the son of jabesh began to reign in the nine and
thirtieth year of uzziah king of judah and he reigned a full month in
samaria
for menahem the son of gadi went up from tirzah and came to
samaria and smote shallum the son of jabesh in samaria and slew him
and reigned in his stead
and the rest of the acts of shallum and his conspiracy which he
made behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of israel
then menahem smote tiphsah and all that were therein and the
coasts thereof from tirzah because they opened not to him therefore
he smote it and all the women therein that were with child he ripped
up
in the nine and thirtieth year of azariah king of judah began
menahem the son of gadi to reign over israel and reigned ten years in
samaria
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he
departed not all his days from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat

and pul the king of assyria came against the land and menahem
gave pul a thousand talents of silver that his hand might be with him
to confirm the kingdom in his hand
and menahem exacted the money of israel even of all the mighty
men of wealth of each man fifty shekels of silver to give to the
king of assyria so the king of assyria turned back and stayed not
there in the land
and the rest of the acts of menahem and all that he did are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel
and menahem slept with his fathers and pekahiah his son reigned
in his stead
in the fiftieth year of azariah king of judah pekahiah the son
of menahem began to reign over israel in samaria and reigned two
years
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he
departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made
israel to sin
but pekah the son of remaliah a captain of his conspired
against him and smote him in samaria in the palace of the kings
house with argob and arieh and with him fifty men of the gileadites
and he killed him and reigned in his room

son of remaliah began to reign over israel in samaria and reigned
twenty years
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he
departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made

in the days of pekah king of israel came tiglathpileser king of

began jotham the son of uzziah king of judah to reign
five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign and he
reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jerusha
the daughter of zadok
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord he did
according to all that his father uzziah had done
howbeit the high places were not removed the people sacrificed
and burned incense still in the high places he built the higher gate
of the house of the lord
now the rest of the acts of jotham and all that he did are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
in those days the lord began to send against judah rezin the
king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah
and jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his
fathers in the city of david his father and ahaz his son reigned in
his stead
in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son
of jotham king of judah began to reign
twenty years old was ahaz when he began to reign and reigned
sixteen years in jerusalem and did not that which was right in the
sight of the lord his god like david his father
but he walked in the way of the kings of israel yea and made
his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the
heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel
and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on
the hills and under every green tree
then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel
came up to jerusalem to war and they besieged ahaz but could not
overcome him
at that time rezin king of syria recovered elath to syria and
drave the jews from elath and the syrians came to elath and dwelt
there unto this day
so ahaz sent messengers to tiglathpileser king of assyria
saying i am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the
hand of the king of syria and out of the hand of the king of israel
which rise up against me
and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of
the lord and in the treasures of the kings house and sent it for a
present to the king of assyria
and the king of assyria hearkened unto him for the king of
assyria went up against damascus and took it and carried the people
of it captive to kir and slew rezin
and king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglathpileser king of
assyria and saw an altar that was at damascus and king ahaz sent to
urijah the priest the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it
according to all the workmanship thereof
and urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king
ahaz had sent from damascus so urijah the priest made it against king
ahaz came from damascus
and when the king was come from damascus the king saw the
altar and the king approached to the altar and offered thereon
and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering and
poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace
offerings upon the altar
and he brought also the brasen altar which was before the lord
from the forefront of the house from between the altar and the house
of the lord and put it on the north side of the altar
and king ahaz commanded urijah the priest saying upon the
great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meat
offering and the kings burnt sacrifice and his meat offering with
the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meat
offering and their drink offerings and sprinkle upon it all the
blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice and
the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by
thus did urijah the priest according to all that king ahaz
commanded
and king ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the
laver from off them and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen
that were under it and put it upon the pavement of stones
and the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house
and the kings entry without turned he from the house of the lord for
the king of assyria
now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
and ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in
the city of david and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead
in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of
elah to reign in samaria over israel nine years
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord but not
as the kings of israel that were before him
against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea
became his servant and gave him presents
and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea for he had
sent messengers to so king of egypt and brought no present to the
king of assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of
assyria shut him up and bound him in prison
then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and
went up to samaria and besieged it three years
in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and
carried israel away into assyria and placed them in halah and in
habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes
for so it was that the children of israel had sinned against the
lord their god which had brought them up out of the land of egypt
from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and had feared other
gods  and walked in the statutes of the heathen whom the lord
cast out from before the children of israel and of the kings of
israel which they had made
and the children of israel did secretly those things that were
not right against the lord their god and they built them high places
in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced
city
and they set them up images and groves in every high hill and
under every green tree  and there they burnt incense in all the
high places as did the heathen whom the lord carried away before
them and wrought wicked things to provoke the lord to anger
for they served idols whereof the lord had said unto them ye shall
not do this thing
yet the lord testified against israel and against judah by all
the prophets and by all the seers saying turn ye from your evil
ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the
law which i commanded your fathers and which i sent to you by my
servants the prophets
notwithstanding they would not hear but hardened their necks
like to the neck of their fathers that did not believe in the lord
their god
and they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made
with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified against
them and they followed vanity and became vain and went after the
heathen that were round about them concerning whom the lord had
charged them that they should not do like them
and they left all the commandments of the lord their god and
made them molten images even two calves and made a grove and
worshipped all the host of heaven and served baal
and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through
the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to
do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger
therefore the lord was very angry with israel and removed them
out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of judah only
also judah kept not the commandments of the lord their god but
walked in the statutes of israel which they made
and the lord rejected all the seed of israel and afflicted
them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast
them out of his sight
for he rent israel from the house of david and they made
jeroboam the son of nebat king and jeroboam drave israel from
following the lord and made them sin a great sin
for the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam
which he did they departed not from them  until the lord
removed israel out of his sight as he had said by all his servants
the prophets so was israel carried away out of their own land to
assyria unto this day
and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from
cuthah and from ava and from hamath and from sepharvaim and placed
them in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel and
they possessed samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof
and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that
they feared not the lord therefore the lord sent lions among them
which slew some of them
wherefore they spake to the king of assyria saying the nations
which thou hast removed and placed in the cities of samaria know not
the manner of the god of the land therefore he hath sent lions among
them and behold they slay them because they know not the manner of
the god of the land
then the king of assyria commanded saying carry thither one of
the priests whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwell
there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land
then one of the priests whom they had carried away from samaria
came and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear the
lord
howbeit every nation made gods of their own and put them in the
houses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nation
in their cities wherein they dwelt
and the men of babylon made succothbenoth and the men of cuth
made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima  and the avites
made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burnt their children in
fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim
so they feared the lord and made unto themselves of the lowest
of them priests of the high places which sacrificed for them in the
houses of the high places
they feared the lord and served their own gods after the
manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence
unto this day they do after the former manners they fear not
the lord neither do they after their statutes or after their
ordinances or after the law and commandment which the lord commanded
the children of jacob whom he named israel  with whom the lord
had made a covenant and charged them saying ye shall not fear other
gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to
them  but the lord who brought you up out of the land of egypt
with great power and a stretched out arm him shall ye fear and him
shall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrifice
and the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the
commandment which he wrote for you ye shall observe to do for
evermore and ye shall not fear other gods
and the covenant that i have made with you ye shall not forget
neither shall ye fear other gods
but the lord your god ye shall fear and he shall deliver you
out of the hand of all your enemies
howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former
manner
so these nations feared the lord and served their graven
images both their children and their childrens children as did
their fathers so do they unto this day
now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king
of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and he
reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem his mothers name also was
abi the daughter of zachariah
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord
according to all that david his father did
he removed the high places and brake the images and cut down
the groves and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that moses had
made for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense to
it and he called it nehushtan
he trusted in the lord god of israel so that after him was none
like him among all the kings of judah nor any that were before him
for he clave to the lord and departed not from following him
but kept his commandments which the lord commanded moses
and the lord was with him and he prospered whithersoever he went
forth and he rebelled against the king of assyria and served him
not
he smote the philistines even unto gaza and the borders
thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah which
was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that
shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria and besieged it
and at the end of three years they took it even in the sixth
year of hezekiah that is in the ninth year of hoshea king of israel
samaria was taken
and the king of assyria did carry away israel unto assyria and
put them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the
cities of the medes  because they obeyed not the voice of the
lord their god but transgressed his covenant and all that moses the
servant of the lord commanded and would not hear them nor do them
now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king
of assyria come up against all the fenced cities of judah and took
them
and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to
lachish saying i have offended return from me that which thou
puttest on me will i bear and the king of assyria appointed unto
hezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty
talents of gold
and hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house
of the lord and in the treasures of the kings house
at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the
temple of the lord and from the pillars which hezekiah king of judah
had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria
and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsaris and rabshakeh
from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem and
they went up and came to jerusalem and when they were come up they
came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the
highway of the fullers field
and when they had called to the king there came out to them
eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna
the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder
and rabshakeh said unto them speak ye now to hezekiah thus
saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this
wherein thou trustest   thou sayest but they are but vain
words i have counsel and strength for the war now on whom dost thou
trust that thou rebellest against me   now behold thou
trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt on
which if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is
pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him
but if ye say unto me we trust in the lord our god is not that
he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and
hath said to judah and jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar
in jerusalem   now therefore i pray thee give pledges to my
lord the king of assyria and i will deliver thee two thousand horses
if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
least of my masters servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots
and for horsemen   am i now come up without the lord against
this place to destroy it  the lord said to me go up against this
land and destroy it
then said eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebna and joah unto
rabshakeh speak i pray thee to thy servants in the syrian language
for we understand it and talk not with us in the jews language in
the ears of the people that are on the wall
but rabshakeh said unto them hath my master sent me to thy
master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the
men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink
their own piss with you   then rabshakeh stood and cried with a
loud voice in the jews language and spake saying hear the word of
the great king the king of assyria  thus saith the king let
not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out
of his hand  neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord
saying the lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be
delivered into the hand of the king of assyria
hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria
make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and then
eat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree and
drink ye every one the waters of his cistern  until i come and
take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a
land of bread and vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that ye
may live and not die and hearken not unto hezekiah when he
persuadeth you saying the lord will deliver us
hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
out of the hand of the king of assyria   where are the gods of
hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim hena and
ivah have they delivered samaria out of mine hand   who are
they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their
country out of mine hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out
of mine hand   but the people held their peace and answered him
not a word for the kings commandment was saying answer him not
then came eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the
household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the
recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words
of rabshakeh
and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent
his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the
house of the lord
and he sent eliakim which was over the household and shebna the
scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to
isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of
trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come to
the birth and there is not strength to bring forth
it may be the lord thy god will hear all the words of rabshakeh
whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living
god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard
wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left
so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah
and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus
saith the lord be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard with
which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me
behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour
and shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the
sword in his own land
so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring
against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish
and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he is
come out to fight against thee he sent messengers again unto
hezekiah saying  thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah
saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying
jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria
behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to
all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of
eden which were in thelasar   where is the king of hamath and
the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena
and ivah   and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the
messengers and read it and hezekiah went up into the house of the
lord and spread it before the lord
and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said o lord god of
israel which dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even
thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven
and earth
lord bow down thine ear and hear open lord thine eyes and
see and hear the words of sennacherib which hath sent him to
reproach the living god
of a truth lord the kings of assyria have destroyed the
nations and their lands  and have cast their gods into the fire
for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone
therefore they have destroyed them
now therefore o lord our god i beseech thee save thou us out
of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art
the lord god even thou only
then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying thus saith
the lord god of israel that which thou hast prayed to me against
sennacherib king of assyria i have heard
this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him the
virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to
scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast
thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against
the holy one of israel
by thy messengers thou hast reproached the lord and hast said
with the multitude of my chariots i am come up to the height of the
mountains to the sides of lebanon and will cut down the tall cedar
trees thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into
the lodgings of his borders and into the forest of his carmel
i have digged and drunk strange waters and with the sole of my
feet have i dried up all the rivers of besieged places
hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient
times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou
shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps
therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were
dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as
the green herb as the grass on the house tops and as corn blasted
before it be grown up
but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and
thy rage against me
because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine
ears therefore i will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy
lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest
and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such
things as grow of themselves and in the second year that which
springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and
plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall yet
again take root downward and bear fruit upward
for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that
escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he
shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come
before it with shield nor cast a bank against it
by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall
not come into this city saith the lord
for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and
for my servant davids sake
and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went
out and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred fourscore and
five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they
were all dead corpses
so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned
and dwelt at nineveh
and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of
nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with
the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon
his son reigned in his stead
in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet
isaiah the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith the
lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live
then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord
saying  i beseech thee o lord remember now how i have walked
before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that
which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore
and it came to pass afore isaiah was gone out into the middle
court that the word of the lord came to him saying  turn again
and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord the
god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy
tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up
unto the house of the lord
and i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver
thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will
defend this city for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake
and isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took and laid it
on the boil and he recovered
and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the
lord will heal me and that i shall go up into the house of the lord
the third day   and isaiah said this sign shalt thou have of the
lord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the
shadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees   and
hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten
degrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degrees
and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord and he brought the
shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of
ahaz
at that time berodachbaladan the son of baladan king of
babylon sent letters and a present unto hezekiah for he had heard
that hezekiah had been sick
and hezekiah hearkened unto them and shewed them all the house
of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and
the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that
was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all
his dominion that hezekiah shewed them not
then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto
him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and
hezekiah said they are come from a far country even from babylon
and he said what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah
answered all the things that are in mine house have they seen there
is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them
and isaiah said unto hezekiah hear the word of the lord
behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that
which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be
carried into babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt
beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace
of the king of babylon
then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of the lord
which thou hast spoken and he said is it not good if peace and
truth be in my days   and the rest of the acts of hezekiah and
all his might and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought
water into the city are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of judah   and hezekiah slept with his
fathers and manasseh his son reigned in his stead
manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and reigned
fifty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name was
hephzibah
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord after
the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out before the
children of israel
for he built up again the high places which hezekiah his father
had destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made a grove as
did ahab king of israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and
served them
and he built altars in the house of the lord of which the lord
said in jerusalem will i put my name
and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
of the house of the lord
and he made his son pass through the fire and observed times
and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he
wrought much wickedness in the sight of the lord to provoke him to
anger
and he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
house of which the lord said to david and to solomon his son in
this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all tribes of
israel will i put my name for ever  neither will i make the feet
of israel move any more out of the land which i gave their fathers
only if they will observe to do according to all that i have commanded
them and according to all the law that my servant moses commanded
them
but they hearkened not and manasseh seduced them to do more evil
than did the nations whom the lord destroyed before the children of
israel
and the lord spake by his servants the prophets saying
because manasseh king of judah hath done these abominations and hath
done wickedly above all that the amorites did which were before him
and hath made judah also to sin with his idols  therefore thus
saith the lord god of israel behold i am bringing such evil upon
jerusalem and judah that whosoever heareth of it both his ears shall
tingle
and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria and the
plummet of the house of ahab and i will wipe jerusalem as a man
wipeth a dish wiping it and turning it upside down
and i will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance and deliver
them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and
a spoil to all their enemies  because they have done that which
was evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day
their fathers came forth out of egypt even unto this day
moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he had
filled jerusalem from one end to another beside his sin wherewith he
made judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of the
lord
now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all that he did and
his sin that he sinned are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of judah   and manasseh slept with his
fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden
of uzza and amon his son reigned in his stead
amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and he
reigned two years in jerusalem and his mothers name was
meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as his
father manasseh did
and he walked in all the way that his father walked in and
served the idols that his father served and worshipped them
and he forsook the lord god of his fathers and walked not in the way
of the lord
and the servants of amon conspired against him and slew the
king in his own house
and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king
in his stead
now the rest of the acts of amon which he did are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of uzza and josiah
his son reigned in his stead
josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned
thirty and one years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jedidah
the daughter of adaiah of boscath
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and
walked in all the way of david his father and turned not aside to the
right hand or to the left
and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah that
the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the
scribe to the house of the lord saying  go up to hilkiah the
high priest that he may sum the silver which is brought into the
house of the lord which the keepers of the door have gathered of the
people  and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the
work that have the oversight of the house of the lord and let them
give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the lord to
repair the breaches of the house  unto carpenters and builders
and masons and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house
howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that
was delivered into their hand because they dealt faithfully
and hilkiah the high priest said unto shaphan the scribe i have
found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah gave
the book to shaphan and he read it
and shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought the king
word again and said thy servants have gathered the money that was
found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of them that
do the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord
and shaphan the scribe shewed the king saying hilkiah the
priest hath delivered me a book and shaphan read it before the king
and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the
book of the law that he rent his clothes
and the king commanded hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son of
shaphan and achbor the son of michaiah and shaphan the scribe and
asahiah a servant of the kings saying  go ye enquire of the
lord for me and for the people and for all judah concerning the
words of this book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord
that is kindled against us because our fathers have not hearkened
unto the words of this book to do according unto all that which is
written concerning us
so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and
asahiah went unto huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son
of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt
in jerusalem in the college and they communed with her
and she said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel tell
the man that sent you to me  thus saith the lord behold i will
bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all
the words of the book which the king of judah hath read  because
they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that
they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands
therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not
be quenched
but to the king of judah which sent you to enquire of the lord
thus shall ye say to him thus saith the lord god of israel as
touching the words which thou hast heard  because thine heart
was tender and thou hast humbled thyself before the lord when thou
heardest what i spake against this place and against the inhabitants
thereof that they should become a desolation and a curse and hast
rent thy clothes and wept before me i also have heard thee saith
the lord
behold therefore i will gather thee unto thy fathers and thou
shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace and thine eyes shall not
see all the evil which i will bring upon this place and they brought
the king word again
and the king sent and they gathered unto him all the elders of
judah and of jerusalem
and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men
of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him and the
priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great
and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant
which was found in the house of the lord
and the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the
lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his
testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul
to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book
and all the people stood to the covenant
and the king commanded hilkiah the high priest and the priests
of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out
of the temple of the lord all the vessels that were made for baal and
for the grove and for all the host of heaven and he burned them
without jerusalem in the fields of kidron and carried the ashes of
them unto bethel
and he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of judah
had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of
judah and in the places round about jerusalem them also that burned
incense unto baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets
and to all the host of heaven
and he brought out the grove from the house of the lord without
jerusalem unto the brook kidron and burned it at the brook kidron
and stamped it small to powder and cast the powder thereof upon the
graves of the children of the people
and he brake down the houses of the sodomites that were by the
house of the lord where the women wove hangings for the grove
and he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah and
defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from
geba to beersheba and brake down the high places of the gates that
were in the entering in of the gate of joshua the governor of the
city which were on a mans left hand at the gate of the city
nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the
altar of the lord in jerusalem but they did eat of the unleavened
bread among their brethren
and he defiled topheth which is in the valley of the children
of hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass
through the fire to molech
and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to
the sun at the entering in of the house of the lord by the chamber
of nathanmelech the chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burned
the chariots of the sun with fire
and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of
ahaz which the kings of judah had made and the altars which manasseh
had made in the two courts of the house of the lord did the king beat
down and brake them down from thence and cast the dust of them into
the brook kidron
and the high places that were before jerusalem which were on
the right hand of the mount of corruption which solomon the king of
israel had builded for ashtoreth the abomination of the zidonians and
for chemosh the abomination of the moabites and for milcom the
abomination of the children of ammon did the king defile
and he brake in pieces the images and cut down the groves and
filled their places with the bones of men
moreover the altar that was at bethel and the high place which
jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin had made both that
altar and the high place he brake down and burned the high place and
stamped it small to powder and burned the grove
and as josiah turned himself he spied the sepulchres that were
there in the mount and sent and took the bones out of the
sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and polluted it according
to the word of the lord which the man of god proclaimed who
proclaimed these words
then he said what title is that that i see and the men of the
city told him it is the sepulchre of the man of god which came from
judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the
altar of bethel
and he said let him alone let no man move his bones so they
let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out of
samaria
and all the houses also of the high places that were in the
cities of samaria which the kings of israel had made to provoke the
lord to anger josiah took away and did to them according to all the
acts that he had done in bethel
and he slew all the priests of the high places that were there
upon the altars and burned mens bones upon them and returned to
jerusalem
and the king commanded all the people saying keep the passover
unto the lord your god as it is written in the book of this covenant
surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the
judges that judged israel nor in all the days of the kings of israel
nor of the kings of judah  but in the eighteenth year of king
josiah wherein this passover was holden to the lord in jerusalem
moreover the workers with familiar spirits and the wizards and
the images and the idols and all the abominations that were spied in
the land of judah and in jerusalem did josiah put away that he might
perform the words of the law which were written in the book that
hilkiah the priest found in the house of the lord
and like unto him was there no king before him that turned to
the lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his
might according to all the law of moses neither after him arose
there any like him
notwithstanding the lord turned not from the fierceness of his
great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against judah because of
all the provocations that manasseh had provoked him withal
and the lord said i will remove judah also out of my sight as
i have removed israel and will cast off this city jerusalem which i
have chosen and the house of which i said my name shall be there
now the rest of the acts of josiah and all that he did are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
in his days pharaohnechoh king of egypt went up against the king
of assyria to the river euphrates and king josiah went against him
and he slew him at megiddo when he had seen him
and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from megiddo and
brought him to jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulchre and the
people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and anointed him
and made him king in his fathers stead
jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign
and he reigned three months in jerusalem and his mothers name was
hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord
according to all that his fathers had done
and pharaohnechoh put him in bands at riblah in the land of
hamath that he might not reign in jerusalem and put the land to a
tribute of an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
and pharaohnechoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in the
room of josiah his father and turned his name to jehoiakim and took
jehoahaz away and he came to egypt and died there
and jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh but he
taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of
pharaoh he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land
of every one according to his taxation to give it unto pharaohnechoh
jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign
and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was
zebudah the daughter of pedaiah of rumah
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord
according to all that his fathers had done
in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakim
became his servant three years then he turned and rebelled against
him
and the lord sent against him bands of the chaldees and bands of
the syrians and bands of the moabites and bands of the children of
ammon and sent them against judah to destroy it according to the
word of the lord which he spake by his servants the prophets
surely at the commandment of the lord came this upon judah to
remove them out of his sight for the sins of manasseh according to
all that he did  and also for the innocent blood that he shed
for he filled jerusalem with innocent blood which the lord would not
pardon
now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and all that he did are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah
so jehoiakim slept with his fathers and jehoiachin his son
reigned in his stead
and the king of egypt came not again any more out of his land
for the king of babylon had taken from the river of egypt unto the
river euphrates all that pertained to the king of egypt
jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign and he
reigned in jerusalem three months and his mothers name was nehushta
the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord
according to all that his father had done
at that time the servants of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came
up against jerusalem and the city was besieged
and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came against the city and
his servants did besiege it
and jehoiachin the king of judah went out to the king of
babylon he and his mother and his servants and his princes and
his officers and the king of babylon took him in the eighth year of
his reign
and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the
lord and the treasures of the kings house and cut in pieces all the
vessels of gold which solomon king of israel had made in the temple of
the lord as the lord had said
and he carried away all jerusalem and all the princes and all
the mighty men of valour even ten thousand captives and all the
craftsmen and smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the
people of the land
and he carried away jehoiachin to babylon and the kings
mother and the kings wives and his officers and the mighty of the
land those carried he into captivity from jerusalem to babylon
and all the men of might even seven thousand and craftsmen and
smiths a thousand all that were strong and apt for war even them the
king of babylon brought captive to babylon
and the king of babylon made mattaniah his fathers brother king
in his stead and changed his name to zedekiah
zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign
and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was
hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord
according to all that jehoiakim had done
for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem
and judah until he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiah
rebelled against the king of babylon
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth
month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadnezzar king of
babylon came he and all his host against jerusalem and pitched
against it and they built forts against it round about
and the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
zedekiah
and on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in
the city and there was no bread for the people of the land
and the city was broken up and all the men of war fled by night
by the way of the gate between two walls which is by the kings
garden now the chaldees were against the city round about and the
king went the way toward the plain
and the army of the chaldees pursued after the king and overtook
him in the plains of jericho and all his army were scattered from
him
so they took the king and brought him up to the king of babylon
to riblah and they gave judgment upon him
and they slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes and put out
the eyes of zedekiah and bound him with fetters of brass and carried
him to babylon
and in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month which is
the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came
nebuzaradan captain of the guard a servant of the king of babylon
unto jerusalem  and he burnt the house of the lord and the
kings house and all the houses of jerusalem and every great mans
house burnt he with fire
and all the army of the chaldees that were with the captain of
the guard brake down the walls of jerusalem round about
now the rest of the people that were left in the city and the
fugitives that fell away to the king of babylon with the remnant of
the multitude did nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away
but the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the
land to be vinedressers and husbandmen
and the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lord and
the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the lord did
the chaldees break in pieces and carried the brass of them to
babylon
and the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the spoons
and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they
away
and the firepans and the bowls and such things as were of
gold in gold and of silver in silver the captain of the guard took
away
the two pillars one sea and the bases which solomon had made
for the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without
weight
the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits and the
chapiter upon it was brass and the height of the chapiter three
cubits and the wreathen work and pomegranates upon the chapiter
round about all of brass and like unto these had the second pillar
with wreathen work
and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and
zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door
and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of
war and five men of them that were in the kings presence which were
found in the city and the principal scribe of the host which
mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of
the land that were found in the city  and nebuzaradan captain of
the guard took these and brought them to the king of babylon to
riblah  and the king of babylon smote them and slew them at
riblah in the land of hamath so judah was carried away out of their
land
and as for the people that remained in the land of judah whom
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had left even over them he made
gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan ruler
and when all the captains of the armies they and their men
heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah governor there came
to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan
the son of careah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite
and jaazaniah the son of a maachathite they and their men
and gedaliah sware to them and to their men and said unto
them fear not to be the servants of the chaldees dwell in the land
and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you
but it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son
of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal came and ten
men with him and smote gedaliah that he died and the jews and the
chaldees that were with him at mizpah
and all the people both small and great and the captains of
the armies arose and came to egypt for they were afraid of the
chaldees
and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month on the
seven and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of
babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of
jehoiachin king of judah out of prison  and he spake kindly to
him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with
him in babylon  and changed his prison garments and he did eat
bread continually before him all the days of his life
and his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the
king a daily rate for every day all the days of his life

so all israel were reckoned by genealogies and behold they were

and the porters were shallum and akkub and talmon and ahiman
and their brethren shallum was the chief  who hitherto waited in
the kings gate eastward they were porters in the companies of the
children of levi
and shallum the son of kore the son of ebiasaph the son of
korah and his brethren of the house of his father the korahites
were over the work of the service keepers of the gates of the
tabernacle and their fathers being over the host of the lord were
keepers of the entry
and phinehas the son of eleazar was the ruler over them in time
past and the lord was with him
and zechariah the son of meshelemiah was porter of the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation
all these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two
hundred and twelve these were reckoned by their genealogy in their
villages whom david and samuel the seer did ordain in their set
office
so they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the
house of the lord namely the house of the tabernacle by wards
in four quarters were the porters toward the east west north
and south
and their brethren which were in their villages were to come
after seven days from time to time with them
for these levites the four chief porters were in their set
office and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of god
and they lodged round about the house of god because the charge
was upon them and the opening thereof every morning pertained to
them
and certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels
that they should bring them in and out by tale
some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels and all
the instruments of the sanctuary and the fine flour and the wine
and the oil and the frankincense and the spices
and some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the
spices
and mattithiah one of the levites who was the firstborn of
shallum the korahite had the set office over the things that were
made in the pans
and other of their brethren of the sons of the kohathites were
over the shewbread to prepare it every sabbath
and these are the singers chief of the fathers of the levites
who remaining in the chambers were free for they were employed in
that work day and night
these chief fathers of the levites were chief throughout their
generations these dwelt at jerusalem
and in gibeon dwelt the father of gibeon jehiel whose wifes
name was maachah  and his firstborn son abdon then zur and
kish and baal and ner and nadab
and gedor and ahio and zechariah and mikloth
and mikloth begat shimeam and they also dwelt with their
brethren at jerusalem over against their brethren
and ner begat kish and kish begat saul and saul begat jonathan
and malchishua and abinadab and eshbaal

and the sons of micah were pithon and melech and tahrea and
ahaz
and ahaz begat jarah and jarah begat alemeth and azmaveth and
zimri and zimri begat moza  and moza begat binea and rephaiah
his son eleasah his son azel his son
and azel had six sons whose names are these azrikam bocheru
and ishmael and sheariah and obadiah and hanan these were the sons
of azel
now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel
fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa
and the philistines followed hard after saul and after his sons
and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and malchishua the
sons of saul
and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him
and he was wounded of the archers
then said saul to his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me
through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me but his
armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid so saul took a sword
and fell upon it
and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell
likewise on the sword and died
so saul died and his three sons and all his house died
together
and when all the men of israel that were in the valley saw that
they fled and that saul and his sons were dead then they forsook
their cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them
and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to
strip the slain that they found saul and his sons fallen in mount
gilboa
and when they had stripped him they took his head and his
armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to
carry tidings unto their idols and to the people
and they put his armour in the house of their gods and fastened
his head in the temple of dagon
and when all jabeshgilead heard all that the philistines had
done to saul  they arose all the valiant men and took away the
body of saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to jabesh
and buried their bones under the oak in jabesh and fasted seven days
so saul died for his transgression which he committed against
the lord even against the word of the lord which he kept not and
also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit to enquire
of it  and enquired not of the lord therefore he slew him and
turned the kingdom unto david the son of jesse
then all israel gathered themselves to david unto hebron saying
behold we are thy bone and thy flesh
and moreover in time past even when saul was king thou wast he
that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord thy god said
unto thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be ruler
over my people israel
therefore came all the elders of israel to the king to hebron
and david made a covenant with them in hebron before the lord and
they anointed david king over israel according to the word of the
lord by samuel
and david and all israel went to jerusalem which is jebus where
the jebusites were the inhabitants of the land
and the inhabitants of jebus said to david thou shalt not come
hither nevertheless david took the castle of zion which is the city
of david
and david said whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall be
chief and captain so joab the son of zeruiah went first up and was
chief
and david dwelt in the castle therefore they called it the city
of david
and he built the city round about even from millo round about
and joab repaired the rest of the city
so david waxed greater and greater for the lord of hosts was
with him
these also are the chief of the mighty men whom david had who
strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom and with all israel
to make him king according to the word of the lord concerning israel
and this is the number of the mighty men whom david had
jashobeam an hachmonite the chief of the captains he lifted up his
spear against three hundred slain by him at one time
and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who was
one of the three mighties
he was with david at pasdammim and there the philistines were
gathered together to battle where was a parcel of ground full of
barley and the people fled from before the philistines
and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel and
delivered it and slew the philistines and the lord saved them by a
great deliverance
now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to david
into the cave of adullam and the host of the philistines encamped in
the valley of rephaim
and david was then in the hold and the philistines garrison
was then at bethlehem
and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of
the water of the well of bethlehem that is at the gate   and
the three brake through the host of the philistines and drew water
out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and
brought it to david but david would not drink of it but poured it
out to the lord
and said my god forbid it me that i should do this thing
shall i drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in
jeopardy for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it
therefore he would not drink it
these things did these three mightiest
and abishai the brother of joab he was chief of the three for
lifting up his spear against three hundred he slew them and had a
name among the three
of the three he was more honourable than the two for he was
their captain howbeit he attained not to the first three
benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of
kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab
also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day
and he slew an egyptian a man of great stature five cubits
high and in the egyptians hand was a spear like a weavers beam and
he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the
egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear
these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name
among the three mighties
behold he was honourable among the thirty but attained not to
the first three and david set him over his guard
also the valiant men of the armies were asahel the brother of
joab elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem  shammoth the
harorite helez the pelonite  ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite
abiezer the antothite  sibbecai the hushathite ilai the
ahohite  maharai the netophathite heled the son of baanah the
netophathite  ithai the son of ribai of gibeah that pertained
to the children of benjamin benaiah the pirathonite  hurai of
the brooks of gaash abiel the arbathite  azmaveth the
baharumite eliahba the shaalbonite  the sons of hashem the
gizonite jonathan the son of shage the hararite  ahiam the son
of sacar the hararite eliphal the son of ur  hepher the
mecherathite ahijah the pelonite  hezro the carmelite naarai
the son of ezbai  joel the brother of nathan mibhar the son of
haggeri  zelek the ammonite naharai the berothite the
armourbearer of joab the son of zeruiah  ira the ithrite gareb
the ithrite  uriah the hittite zabad the son of ahlai
adina the son of shiza the reubenite a captain of the reubenites and
thirty with him  hanan the son of maachah and joshaphat the
mithnite  uzzia the ashterathite shama and jehiel the sons of
hothan the aroerite  jediael the son of shimri and joha his
brother the tizite  eliel the mahavite and jeribai and
joshaviah the sons of elnaam and ithmah the moabite  eliel
and obed and jasiel the mesobaite
now these are they that came to david to ziklag while he yet
kept himself close because of saul the son of kish and they were
among the mighty men helpers of the war
they were armed with bows and could use both the right hand and
the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow even of
sauls brethren of benjamin
the chief was ahiezer then joash the sons of shemaah the
gibeathite and jeziel and pelet the sons of azmaveth and berachah
and jehu the antothite
and ismaiah the gibeonite a mighty man among the thirty and
over the thirty and jeremiah and jahaziel and johanan and josabad
the gederathite  eluzai and jerimoth and bealiah and
shemariah and shephatiah the haruphite  elkanah and jesiah and
azareel and joezer and jashobeam the korhites  and joelah and
zebadiah the sons of jeroham of gedor
and of the gadites there separated themselves unto david into the
hold to the wilderness men of might and men of war fit for the
battle that could handle shield and buckler whose faces were like
the faces of lions and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains
ezer the first obadiah the second eliab the third
mishmannah the fourth jeremiah the fifth  attai the sixth
eliel the seventh  johanan the eighth elzabad the ninth
jeremiah the tenth machbanai the eleventh
these were of the sons of gad captains of the host one of the
least was over an hundred and the greatest over a thousand
these are they that went over jordan in the first month when it
had overflown all his banks and they put to flight all them of the
valleys both toward the east and toward the west
and there came of the children of benjamin and judah to the hold
unto david
and david went out to meet them and answered and said unto
them if ye be come peaceably unto me to help me mine heart shall be
knit unto you but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies seeing
there is no wrong in mine hands the god of our fathers look thereon
and rebuke it
then the spirit came upon amasai who was chief of the captains
and he said thine are we david and on thy side thou son of jesse
peace peace be unto thee and peace be to thine helpers for thy god
helpeth thee
then david received them and made them captains of the band
and there fell some of manasseh to david when he came with the
philistines against saul to battle but they helped them not for the
lords of the philistines upon advisement sent him away saying he
will fall to his master saul to the jeopardy of our heads
as he went to ziklag there fell to him of manasseh adnah and
jozabad and jediael and michael and jozabad and elihu and
zilthai captains of the thousands that were of manasseh
and they helped david against the band of the rovers for they
were all mighty men of valour and were captains in the host
for at that time day by day there came to david to help him
until it was a great host like the host of god
and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to
the war and came to david to hebron to turn the kingdom of saul to
him according to the word of the lord
the children of judah that bare shield and spear were six
thousand and eight hundred ready armed to the war
of the children of simeon mighty men of valour for the war
seven thousand and one hundred
of the children of levi four thousand and six hundred
and jehoiada was the leader of the aaronites and with him were
three thousand and seven hundred  and zadok a young man mighty
of valour and of his fathers house twenty and two captains
and of the children of benjamin the kindred of saul three
thousand for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of
the house of saul
and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand and eight
hundred mighty men of valour famous throughout the house of their
fathers
and of the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand which were
expressed by name to come and make david king
and of the children of issachar which were men that had
understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do the heads
of them were two hundred and all their brethren were at their
commandment
of zebulun such as went forth to battle expert in war with
all instruments of war fifty thousand which could keep rank they
were not of double heart
and of naphtali a thousand captains and with them with shield
and spear thirty and seven thousand
and of the danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and
six hundred
and of asher such as went forth to battle expert in war forty
thousand
and on the other side of jordan of the reubenites and the
gadites and of the half tribe of manasseh with all manner of
instruments of war for the battle an hundred and twenty thousand
all these men of war that could keep rank came with a perfect
heart to hebron to make david king over all israel and all the rest
also of israel were of one heart to make david king
and there they were with david three days eating and drinking
for their brethren had prepared for them
moreover they that were nigh them even unto issachar and
zebulun and naphtali brought bread on asses and on camels and on
mules and on oxen and meat meal cakes of figs and bunches of
raisins and wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly for there
was joy in israel
and david consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds
and with every leader
and david said unto all the congregation of israel if it seem
good unto you and that it be of the lord our god let us send abroad
unto our brethren every where that are left in all the land of
israel and with them also to the priests and levites which are in
their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us
and let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we enquired
not at it in the days of saul
and all the congregation said that they would do so for the
thing was right in the eyes of all the people
so david gathered all israel together from shihor of egypt even
unto the entering of hemath to bring the ark of god from
kirjathjearim
and david went up and all israel to baalah that is to
kirjathjearim which belonged to judah to bring up thence the ark of
god the lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is
called on it
and they carried the ark of god in a new cart out of the house of
abinadab and uzza and ahio drave the cart
and david and all israel played before god with all their might
and with singing and with harps and with psalteries and with
timbrels and with cymbals and with trumpets
and when they came unto the threshingfloor of chidon uzza put
forth his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbled
and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzza and he smote
him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before god
and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach
upon uzza wherefore that place is called perezuzza to this day
and david was afraid of god that day saying how shall i bring
the ark of god home to me   so david brought not the ark home to
himself to the city of david but carried it aside into the house of
obededom the gittite
and the ark of god remained with the family of obededom in his
house three months and the lord blessed the house of obededom and
all that he had
now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and timber of
cedars with masons and carpenters to build him an house
and david perceived that the lord had confirmed him king over
israel for his kingdom was lifted up on high because of his people
israel
and david took more wives at jerusalem and david begat more sons
and daughters
now these are the names of his children which he had in
jerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon  and ibhar
and elishua and elpalet  and nogah and nepheg and japhia
and elishama and beeliada and eliphalet
and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over
all israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard
of it and went out against them
and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of
rephaim
and david enquired of god saying shall i go up against the
philistines and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord
said unto him go up for i will deliver them into thine hand
so they came up to baalperazim and david smote them there then
david said god hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the
breaking forth of waters therefore they called the name of that place
baalperazim
and when they had left their gods there david gave a
commandment and they were burned with fire
and the philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
valley
therefore david enquired again of god and god said unto him go
not up after them turn away from them and come upon them over
against the mulberry trees
and it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the
tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt go out to battle for
god is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines
david therefore did as god commanded him and they smote the
host of the philistines from gibeon even to gazer
and the fame of david went out into all lands and the lord
brought the fear of him upon all nations
and david made him houses in the city of david and prepared a
place for the ark of god and pitched for it a tent
then david said none ought to carry the ark of god but the
levites for them hath the lord chosen to carry the ark of god and to
minister unto him for ever
and david gathered all israel together to jerusalem to bring up
the ark of the lord unto his place which he had prepared for it
and david assembled the children of aaron and the levites
of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brethren an hundred
and twenty  of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and his
brethren two hundred and twenty  of the sons of gershom joel the
chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty  of the sons of
elizaphan shemaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred  of
the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brethren fourscore
of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brethren an
hundred and twelve
and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the
levites for uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and
amminadab  and said unto them ye are the chief of the fathers
of the levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that
ye may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto the place that
i have prepared for it
for because ye did it not at the first the lord our god made a
breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order
so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up
the ark of the lord god of israel
and the children of the levites bare the ark of god upon their
shoulders with the staves thereon as moses commanded according to the
word of the lord
and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their
brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick psalteries and
harps and cymbals sounding by lifting up the voice with joy
so the levites appointed heman the son of joel and of his
brethren asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari their
brethren ethan the son of kushaiah  and with them their
brethren of the second degree zechariah ben and jaaziel and
shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah
and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel
the porters
so the singers heman asaph and ethan were appointed to sound
with cymbals of brass  and zechariah and aziel and
shemiramoth and jehiel and unni and eliab and maaseiah and
benaiah with psalteries on alamoth  and mattithiah and
elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel and azaziah with
harps on the sheminith to excel
and chenaniah chief of the levites was for song he instructed
about the song because he was skilful
and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark
and shebaniah and jehoshaphat and nethaneel and amasai and
zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests did blow with the
trumpets before the ark of god and obededom and jehiah were
doorkeepers for the ark
so david and the elders of israel and the captains over
thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of
the house of obededom with joy
and it came to pass when god helped the levites that bare the
ark of the covenant of the lord that they offered seven bullocks and
seven rams
and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the
levites that bare the ark and the singers and chenaniah the master
of the song with the singers david also had upon him an ephod of
linen
thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord
with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and
with cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harps
and it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the lord came
to the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looking out at
a window saw king david dancing and playing and she despised him in
her heart
so they brought the ark of god and set it in the midst of the
tent that david had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices
and peace offerings before god
and when david had made an end of offering the burnt offerings
and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the
lord
and he dealt to every one of israel both man and woman to every
one a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine
and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the
ark of the lord and to record and to thank and praise the lord god
of israel  asaph the chief and next to him zechariah jeiel and
shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and
obededom and jeiel with psalteries and with harps but asaph made a
sound with cymbals  benaiah also and jahaziel the priests with
trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god
then on that day david delivered first this psalm to thank the
lord into the hand of asaph and his brethren
give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his
deeds among the people
sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous
works
glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that
seek the lord
seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually
remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders
and the judgments of his mouth  o ye seed of israel his servant
ye children of jacob his chosen ones
he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth
be ye mindful always of his covenant the word which he
commanded to a thousand generations  even of the covenant which
he made with abraham and of his oath unto isaac  and hath
confirmed the same to jacob for a law and to israel for an
everlasting covenant  saying unto thee will i give the land of
canaan the lot of your inheritance  when ye were but few even
a few and strangers in it
and when they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom
to another people  he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he
reproved kings for their sakes  saying touch not mine anointed
and do my prophets no harm
sing unto the lord all the earth shew forth from day to day
his salvation
declare his glory among the heathen his marvellous works among
all nations
for great is the lord and greatly to be praised he also is to
be feared above all gods
for all the gods of the people are idols but the lord made the
heavens
glory and honour are in his presence strength and gladness are
in his place
give unto the lord ye kindreds of the people give unto the
lord glory and strength
give unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an
offering and come before him worship the lord in the beauty of
holiness
fear before him all the earth the world also shall be stable
that it be not moved
let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let men
say among the nations the lord reigneth
let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the fields
rejoice and all that is therein
then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the
lord because he cometh to judge the earth
o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy
endureth for ever
and say ye save us o god of our salvation and gather us
together and deliver us from the heathen that we may give thanks to
thy holy name and glory in thy praise
blessed be the lord god of israel for ever and ever and all the
people said amen and praised the lord
so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord
asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as
every days work required  and obededom with their brethren
threescore and eight obededom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to
be porters  and zadok the priest and his brethren the priests
before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that was at
gibeon  to offer burnt offerings unto the lord upon the altar of
the burnt offering continually morning and evening and to do
according to all that is written in the law of the lord which he
commanded israel  and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest
that were chosen who were expressed by name to give thanks to the
lord because his mercy endureth for ever  and with them heman
and jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a
sound and with musical instruments of god and the sons of jeduthun
were porters
and all the people departed every man to his house and david
returned to bless his house
now it came to pass as david sat in his house that david said
to nathan the prophet lo i dwell in an house of cedars but the ark
of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtains
then nathan said unto david do all that is in thine heart for
god is with thee
and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came to
nathan saying  go and tell david my servant thus saith the
lord thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in  for i have
not dwelt in an house since the day that i brought up israel unto this
day but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to
another
wheresoever i have walked with all israel spake i a word to any
of the judges of israel whom i commanded to feed my people saying
why have ye not built me an house of cedars   now therefore thus
shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i
took thee from the sheepcote even from following the sheep that thou
shouldest be ruler over my people israel  and i have been with
thee whithersoever thou hast walked and have cut off all thine
enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of
the great men that are in the earth
also i will ordain a place for my people israel and will plant
them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more
neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at
the beginning  and since the time that i commanded judges to be
over my people israel moreover i will subdue all thine enemies
furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee an house
and it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou
must go to be with thy fathers that i will raise up thy seed after
thee which shall be of thy sons and i will establish his kingdom
he shall build me an house and i will stablish his throne for
ever
i will be his father and he shall be my son and i will not
take my mercy away from him as i took it from him that was before
thee  but i will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for
ever and his throne shall be established for evermore
according to all these words and according to all this vision
so did nathan speak unto david
and david the king came and sat before the lord and said who
am i o lord god and what is mine house that thou hast brought me
hitherto   and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes o god
for thou hast also spoken of thy servants house for a great while to
come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high
degree o lord god
what can david speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant
for thou knowest thy servant
o lord for thy servants sake and according to thine own
heart hast thou done all this greatness in making known all these
great things
o lord there is none like thee neither is there any god beside
thee according to all that we have heard with our ears
and what one nation in the earth is like thy people israel whom
god went to redeem to be his own people to make thee a name of
greatness and terribleness by driving out nations from before thy
people whom thou hast redeemed out of egypt   for thy people
israel didst thou make thine own people for ever and thou lord
becamest their god
therefore now lord let the thing that thou hast spoken
concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for
ever and do as thou hast said
let it even be established that thy name may be magnified for
ever saying the lord of hosts is the god of israel even a god to
israel and let the house of david thy servant be established before
thee
for thou o my god hast told thy servant that thou wilt build
him an house therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray
before thee
and now lord thou art god and hast promised this goodness
unto thy servant  now therefore let it please thee to bless the
house of thy servant that it may be before thee for ever for thou
blessest o lord and it shall be blessed for ever
now after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines
and subdued them and took gath and her towns out of the hand of the
philistines
and he smote moab and the moabites became davids servants and
brought gifts
and david smote hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath as he went
to stablish his dominion by the river euphrates
and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand
horsemen and twenty thousand footmen david also houghed all the
chariot horses but reserved of them an hundred chariots
and when the syrians of damascus came to help hadarezer king of
zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men
then david put garrisons in syriadamascus and the syrians became
davids servants and brought gifts thus the lord preserved david
whithersoever he went
and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
hadarezer and brought them to jerusalem
likewise from tibhath and from chun cities of hadarezer
brought david very much brass wherewith solomon made the brasen sea
and the pillars and the vessels of brass
now when tou king of hamath heard how david had smitten all the
host of hadarezer king of zobah  he sent hadoram his son to king
david to enquire of his welfare and to congratulate him because he
had fought against hadarezer and smitten him for hadarezer had war
with tou and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and
brass
them also king david dedicated unto the lord with the silver
and the gold that he brought from all these nations from edom and
from moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistines
and from amalek
moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in the
valley of salt eighteen thousand
and he put garrisons in edom and all the edomites became
davids servants thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went
so david reigned over all israel and executed judgment and
justice among all his people
and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat
the son of ahilud recorder
and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiathar
were the priests and shavsha was scribe  and benaiah the son of
jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of
david were chief about the king
now it came to pass after this that nahash the king of the
children of ammon died and his son reigned in his stead
and david said i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of
nahash because his father shewed kindness to me and david sent
messengers to comfort him concerning his father so the servants of
david came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun to comfort
him
but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun thinkest
thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters
unto thee  are not his servants come unto thee for to search and to
overthrow and to spy out the land   wherefore hanun took davids
servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the midst
hard by their buttocks and sent them away
then there went certain and told david how the men were served
and he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed and the
king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then
return
and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves
odious to david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand
talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of
mesopotamia and out of syriamaachah and out of zobah
so they hired thirty and two thousand chariots and the king of
maachah and his people who came and pitched before medeba and the
children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and
came to battle
and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the
mighty men
and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array
before the gate of the city and the kings that were come were by
themselves in the field
now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and
behind he chose out of all the choice of israel and put them in
array against the syrians
and the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of abishai
his brother and they set themselves in array against the children of
ammon
and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou
shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee
then i will help thee
be of good courage and let us behave ourselves valiantly for
our people and for the cities of our god and let the lord do that
which is good in his sight
so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
syrians unto the battle and they fled before him
and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled
they likewise fled before abishai his brother and entered into the
city then joab came to jerusalem
and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before
israel they sent messengers and drew forth the syrians that were
beyond the river and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer
went before them
and it was told david and he gathered all israel and passed
over jordan and came upon them and set the battle in array against
them so when david had put the battle in array against the syrians
they fought with him
but the syrians fled before israel and david slew of the
syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots and forty
thousand footmen and killed shophach the captain of the host
and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the
worse before israel they made peace with david and became his
servants neither would the syrians help the children of ammon any
more
and it came to pass that after the year was expired at the time
that kings go out to battle joab led forth the power of the army and
wasted the country of the children of ammon and came and besieged
rabbah but david tarried at jerusalem and joab smote rabbah and
destroyed it
and david took the crown of their king from off his head and
found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in
it and it was set upon davids head and he brought also exceeding
much spoil out of the city
and he brought out the people that were in it and cut them with
saws and with harrows of iron and with axes even so dealt david
with all the cities of the children of ammon and david and all the
people returned to jerusalem
and it came to pass after this that there arose war at gezer
with the philistines at which time sibbechai the hushathite slew
sippai that was of the children of the giant and they were subdued
and there was war again with the philistines and elhanan the son
of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite whose spear
staff was like a weavers beam
and yet again there was war at gath where was a man of great
stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each
hand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant
but when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimea davids
brother slew him
these were born unto the giant in gath and they fell by the hand
of david and by the hand of his servants
and satan stood up against israel and provoked david to number
israel
and david said to joab and to the rulers of the people go
number israel from beersheba even to dan and bring the number of them
to me that i may know it
and joab answered the lord make his people an hundred times so
many more as they be but my lord the king are they not all my
lords servants  why then doth my lord require this thing why will
he be a cause of trespass to israel   nevertheless the kings
word prevailed against joab wherefore joab departed and went
throughout all israel and came to jerusalem
and joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto david and
all they of israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand
men that drew sword and judah was four hundred threescore and ten
thousand men that drew sword
but levi and benjamin counted he not among them for the kings
word was abominable to joab
and god was displeased with this thing therefore he smote
israel
and david said unto god i have sinned greatly because i have
done this thing but now i beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy
servant for i have done very foolishly
and the lord spake unto gad davids seer saying  go and
tell david saying thus saith the lord i offer thee three things
choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee
so gad came to david and said unto him thus saith the lord
choose thee  either three years famine or three months to be
destroyed before thy foes while that the sword of thine enemies
overtaketh thee or else three days the sword of the lord even the
pestilence in the land and the angel of the lord destroying
throughout all the coasts of israel now therefore advise thyself what
word i shall bring again to him that sent me
and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let me fall now
into the hand of the lord for very great are his mercies but let me
not fall into the hand of man
so the lord sent pestilence upon israel and there fell of
israel seventy thousand men
and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and as he
was destroying the lord beheld and he repented him of the evil and
said to the angel that destroyed it is enough stay now thine hand
and the angel of the lord stood by the threshingfloor of ornan the
jebusite
and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the lord
stand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his
hand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the elders of
israel who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces
and david said unto god is it not i that commanded the people
to be numbered even i it is that have sinned and done evil indeed
but as for these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray
thee o lord my god be on me and on my fathers house but not on
thy people that they should be plagued
then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david that
david should go up and set up an altar unto the lord in the
threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite
and david went up at the saying of gad which he spake in the
name of the lord
and ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with
him hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat
and as david came to ornan ornan looked and saw david and went
out of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to david with his face to
the ground
then david said to ornan grant me the place of this
threshingfloor that i may build an altar therein unto the lord thou
shalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed
from the people
and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord the
king do that which is good in his eyes lo i give thee the oxen also
for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the
wheat for the meat offering i give it all
and king david said to ornan nay but i will verily buy it for
the full price for i will not take that which is thine for the lord
nor offer burnt offerings without cost
so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold
by weight
and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings and called upon the lord and he
answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering
and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again
into the sheath thereof
at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him in
the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there
for the tabernacle of the lord which moses made in the
wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season
in the high place at gibeon
but david could not go before it to enquire of god for he was
afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord
then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is
the altar of the burnt offering for israel
and david commanded to gather together the strangers that were in
the land of israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build
the house of god
and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors
of the gates and for the joinings and brass in abundance without
weight  also cedar trees in abundance for the zidonians and they
of tyre brought much cedar wood to david
and david said solomon my son is young and tender and the house
that is to be builded for the lord must be exceeding magnifical of
fame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore now make
preparation for it so david prepared abundantly before his death
then he called for solomon his son and charged him to build an
house for the lord god of israel
and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind
to build an house unto the name of the lord my god  but the word
of the lord came to me saying thou hast shed blood abundantly and
hast made great wars thou shalt not build an house unto my name
because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight
behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest
and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his
name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel
in his days
he shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son and
i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom
over israel for ever
now my son the lord be with thee and prosper thou and build
the house of the lord thy god as he hath said of thee
only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee
charge concerning israel that thou mayest keep the law of the lord
thy god
then shalt thou prosper if thou takest heed to fulfil the
statutes and judgments which the lord charged moses with concerning
israel be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayed
now behold in my trouble i have prepared for the house of the
lord an hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand
talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in
abundance timber also and stone have i prepared and thou mayest add
thereto
moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and
workers of stone and timber and all manner of cunning men for every
manner of work
of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is
no number arise therefore and be doing and the lord be with thee
david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon
his son saying  is not the lord your god with you and hath he
not given you rest on every side for he hath given the inhabitants of
the land into mine hand and the land is subdued before the lord and
before his people
now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your god
arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god to bring
the ark of the covenant of the lord and the holy vessels of god into
the house that is to be built to the name of the lord
so when david was old and full of days he made solomon his son
king over israel
and he gathered together all the princes of israel with the
priests and the levites
now the levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty and
eight thousand
of which twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work
of the house of the lord and six thousand were officers and judges
moreover four thousand were porters and four thousand praised
the lord with the instruments which i made said david to praise
therewith
and david divided them into courses among the sons of levi
namely gershon kohath and merari
of the gershonites were laadan and shimei
the sons of laadan the chief was jehiel and zetham and joel
three
the sons of shimei shelomith and haziel and haran three
these were the chief of the fathers of laadan
and the sons of shimei were jahath zina and jeush and
beriah
these four were the sons of shimei
and jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush and
beriah had not many sons therefore they were in one reckoning
according to their fathers house
the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four
the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was separated
that he should sanctify the most holy things he and his sons for
ever to burn incense before the lord to minister unto him and to
bless in his name for ever
now concerning moses the man of god his sons were named of the
tribe of levi
the sons of moses were gershom and eliezer
of the sons of gershom shebuel was the chief
and the sons of eliezer were rehabiah the chief and eliezer
had none other sons but the sons of rehabiah were very many
of the sons of izhar shelomith the chief
of the sons of hebron jeriah the first amariah the second
jahaziel the third and jekameam the fourth
of the sons of uzziel micah the first and jesiah the second
the sons of merari mahli and mushi the sons of mahli
eleazar and kish
and eleazar died and had no sons but daughters and their
brethren the sons of kish took them
the sons of mushi mahli and eder and jeremoth three
these were the sons of levi after the house of their fathers
even the chief of the fathers as they were counted by number of names
by their polls that did the work for the service of the house of the
lord from the age of twenty years and upward
for david said the lord god of israel hath given rest unto his
people that they may dwell in jerusalem for ever  and also unto
the levites they shall no more carry the tabernacle nor any vessels
of it for the service thereof
for by the last words of david the levites were numbered from
twenty years old and above  because their office was to wait on
the sons of aaron for the service of the house of the lord in the
courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things
and the work of the service of the house of god  both for the
shewbread and for the fine flour for meat offering and for the

lord
now these are the divisions of the sons of aaron the sons of
aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar
but nadab and abihu died before their father and had no
children therefore eleazar and ithamar executed the priests office
and david distributed them both zadok of the sons of eleazar
and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar according to their offices in
their service
and there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar than
of the sons of ithamar and thus were they divided among the sons of
eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers
and eight among the sons of ithamar according to the house of their
fathers
thus were they divided by lot one sort with another for the
governors of the sanctuary and governors of the house of god were of

the priests and levites one principal household being taken for

by course and the captains over the thousands and captains over the
hundreds and the stewards over all the substance and possession of
the king and of his sons with the officers and with the mighty men
and with all the valiant men unto jerusalem
then david the king stood up upon his feet and said hear me my
brethren and my people as for me i had in mine heart to build an
house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the lord and for the
footstool of our god and had made ready for the building  but
god said unto me thou shalt not build an house for my name because
thou hast been a man of war and hast shed blood
howbeit the lord god of israel chose me before all the house of
my father to be king over israel for ever for he hath chosen judah to
be the ruler and of the house of judah the house of my father and
among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all
israel  and of all my sons for the lord hath given me many
sons he hath chosen solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the
kingdom of the lord over israel
and he said unto me solomon thy son he shall build my house and
my courts for i have chosen him to be my son and i will be his
father
moreover i will establish his kingdom for ever if he be constant
to do my commandments and my judgments as at this day
now therefore in the sight of all israel the congregation of the
lord and in the audience of our god keep and seek for all the
commandments of the lord your god that ye may possess this good land
and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever
and thou solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and
serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the lord
searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the
thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou
forsake him he will cast thee off for ever
take heed now for the lord hath chosen thee to build an house
for the sanctuary be strong and do it
then david gave to solomon his son the pattern of the porch and
of the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof and of the upper
chambers thereof and of the inner parlours thereof and of the place
of the mercy seat  and the pattern of all that he had by the
spirit of the courts of the house of the lord and of all the
chambers round about of the treasuries of the house of god and of
the treasuries of the dedicated things  also for the courses of
the priests and the levites and for all the work of the service of
the house of the lord and for all the vessels of service in the house
of the lord
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold for all
instruments of all manner of service silver also for all instruments
of silver by weight for all instruments of every kind of service
even the weight for the candlesticks of gold and for their
lamps of gold by weight for every candlestick and for the lamps
thereof and for the candlesticks of silver by weight both for the

silver by weight for every bason of silver  and for the altar of
incense refined gold by weight and gold for the pattern of the
chariot of the cherubims that spread out their wings and covered the
ark of the covenant of the lord
all this said david the lord made me understand in writing by
his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern
and david said to solomon his son be strong and of good
courage and do it fear not nor be dismayed for the lord god even
my god will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee
until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of
the lord
and behold the courses of the priests and the levites even
they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of god and
there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing
skilful man for any manner of service also the princes and all the
people will be wholly at thy commandment
furthermore david the king said unto all the congregation
solomon my son whom alone god hath chosen is yet young and tender
and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the lord
god
now i have prepared with all my might for the house of my god the
gold for things to be made of gold and the silver for things of
silver and the brass for things of brass the iron for things of
iron and wood for things of wood onyx stones and stones to be set
glistering stones and of divers colours and all manner of precious
stones and marble stones in abundance
moreover because i have set my affection to the house of my god
i have of mine own proper good of gold and silver which i have given
to the house of my god over and above all that i have prepared for
the holy house
even three thousand talents of gold of the gold of ophir and
seven thousand talents of refined silver to overlay the walls of the
houses withal  the gold for things of gold and the silver for
things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands
of artificers and who then is willing to consecrate his service this
day unto the lord   then the chief of the fathers and princes of
the tribes of israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds
with the rulers of the kings work offered willingly  and gave
for the service of the house of god of gold five thousand talents and
ten thousand drams and of silver ten thousand talents and of brass
eighteen thousand talents and one hundred thousand talents of iron
and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
treasure of the house of the lord by the hand of jehiel the
gershonite
then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly
because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the lord and
david the king also rejoiced with great joy
wherefore david blessed the lord before all the congregation
and david said blessed be thou lord god of israel our father for
ever and ever
thine o lord is the greatness and the power and the glory
and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in
the earth is thine thine is the kingdom o lord and thou art exalted
as head above all
both riches and honour come of thee and thou reignest over all
and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make
great and to give strength unto all
now therefore our god we thank thee and praise thy glorious
name
but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to
offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and
of thine own have we given thee
for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all
our fathers our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is none
abiding
o lord our god all this store that we have prepared to build
thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand and is all
thine own
i know also my god that thou triest the heart and hast
pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of mine heart i
have willingly offered all these things and now have i seen with joy
thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee
o lord god of abraham isaac and of israel our fathers keep
this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy
people and prepare their heart unto thee  and give unto solomon
my son a perfect heart to keep thy commandments thy testimonies and
thy statutes and to do all these things and to build the palace for
the which i have made provision
and david said to all the congregation now bless the lord your
god
and all the congregation blessed the lord god of their fathers and
bowed down their heads and worshipped the lord and the king
and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the lord and offered burnt
offerings unto the lord on the morrow after that day even a thousand
bullocks a thousand rams and a thousand lambs with their drink
offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all israel  and did
eat and drink before the lord on that day with great gladness and
they made solomon the son of david king the second time and anointed
him unto the lord to be the chief governor and zadok to be priest
then solomon sat on the throne of the lord as king instead of
david his father and prospered and all israel obeyed him
and all the princes and the mighty men and all the sons
likewise of king david submitted themselves unto solomon the king
and the lord magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
israel and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on
any king before him in israel
thus david the son of jesse reigned over all israel
and the time that he reigned over israel was forty years seven
years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in
jerusalem
and he died in a good old age full of days riches and honour
and solomon his son reigned in his stead
now the acts of david the king first and last behold they are
written in the book of samuel the seer and in the book of nathan the
prophet and in the book of gad the seer  with all his reign and
his might and the times that went over him and over israel and over
all the kingdoms of the countries
the second book of the chronicles
and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom and
the lord his god was with him and magnified him exceedingly
then solomon spake unto all israel to the captains of thousands
and of hundreds and to the judges and to every governor in all
israel the chief of the fathers
so solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high
place that was at gibeon for there was the tabernacle of the
congregation of god which moses the servant of the lord had made in
the wilderness
but the ark of god had david brought up from kirjathjearim to the
place which david had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for
it at jerusalem
moreover the brasen altar that bezaleel the son of uri the son
of hur had made he put before the tabernacle of the lord and
solomon and the congregation sought unto it
and solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the lord
which was at the tabernacle of the congregation and offered a
thousand burnt offerings upon it
in that night did god appear unto solomon and said unto him ask
what i shall give thee
and solomon said unto god thou hast shewed great mercy unto david
my father and hast made me to reign in his stead
now o lord god let thy promise unto david my father be
established for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of
the earth in multitude
give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in
before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so
great   and god said to solomon because this was in thine heart
and thou hast not asked riches wealth or honour nor the life of
thine enemies neither yet hast asked long life but hast asked wisdom
and knowledge for thyself that thou mayest judge my people over whom
i have made thee king  wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee
and i will give thee riches and wealth and honour such as none of
the kings have had that have been before thee neither shall there any
after thee have the like
then solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at
gibeon to jerusalem from before the tabernacle of the congregation
and reigned over israel
and solomon gathered chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand
and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen which he
placed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem
and the king made silver and gold at jerusalem as plenteous as
stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the
vale for abundance
and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the
kings merchants received the linen yarn at a price
and they fetched up and brought forth out of egypt a chariot for
six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty
and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the hittites and
for the kings of syria by their means
and solomon determined to build an house for the name of the lord
and an house for his kingdom
and solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
burdens and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain and three
thousand and six hundred to oversee them
and solomon sent to huram the king of tyre saying as thou didst
deal with david my father and didst send him cedars to build him an
house to dwell therein even so deal with me
behold i build an house to the name of the lord my god to
dedicate it to him and to burn before him sweet incense and for the
continual shewbread and for the burnt offerings morning and evening
on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts of the
lord our god this is an ordinance for ever to israel
and the house which i build is great for great is our god above
all gods
but who is able to build him an house seeing the heaven and
heaven of heavens cannot contain him who am i then that i should
build him an house save only to burn sacrifice before him   send
me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold and in silver and in
brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that can
skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in judah and in
jerusalem whom david my father did provide
send me also cedar trees fir trees and algum trees out of
lebanon for i know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in
lebanon and behold my servants shall be with thy servants  even
to prepare me timber in abundance for the house which i am about to
build shall be wonderful great
and behold i will give to thy servants the hewers that cut
timber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand
measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty
thousand baths of oil
then huram the king of tyre answered in writing which he sent to
solomon because the lord hath loved his people he hath made thee
king over them
huram said moreover blessed be the lord god of israel that made
heaven and earth who hath given to david the king a wise son endued
with prudence and understanding that might build an house for the
lord and an house for his kingdom
and now i have sent a cunning man endued with understanding of
huram my fathers  the son of a woman of the daughters of dan
and his father was a man of tyre skilful to work in gold and in
silver in brass in iron in stone and in timber in purple in
blue and in fine linen and in crimson also to grave any manner of
graving and to find out every device which shall be put to him with
thy cunning men and with the cunning men of my lord david thy father
now therefore the wheat and the barley the oil and the wine
which my lord hath spoken of let him send unto his servants  and
we will cut wood out of lebanon as much as thou shalt need and we
will bring it to thee in floats by sea to joppa and thou shalt carry
it up to jerusalem
and solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of
israel after the numbering wherewith david his father had numbered
them and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three
thousand and six hundred
and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of
burdens and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain and
three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work
then solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem in
mount moriah where the lord appeared unto david his father in the
place that david had prepared in the threshingfloor of ornan the
jebusite
and he began to build in the second day of the second month in
the fourth year of his reign
now these are the things wherein solomon was instructed for the
building of the house of god the length by cubits after the first
measure was threescore cubits and the breadth twenty cubits
and the porch that was in the front of the house the length of it
was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the
height was an hundred and twenty and he overlaid it within with pure
gold
and the greater house he cieled with fir tree which he overlaid
with fine gold and set thereon palm trees and chains
and he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty and
the gold was gold of parvaim
he overlaid also the house the beams the posts and the walls
thereof and the doors thereof with gold and graved cherubims on the
walls
and he made the most holy house the length whereof was according
to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the breadth thereof
twenty cubits and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to six
hundred talents
and the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold and he
overlaid the upper chambers with gold
and in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work
and overlaid them with gold
and the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long one wing
of the one cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house
and the other wing was likewise five cubits reaching to the wing of
the other cherub
and one wing of the other cherub was five cubits reaching to the
wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits also joining to
the wing of the other cherub
the wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
cubits and they stood on their feet and their faces were inward
and he made the vail of blue and purple and crimson and fine
linen and wrought cherubims thereon
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
cubits high and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was
five cubits
and he made chains as in the oracle and put them on the heads
of the pillars and made an hundred pomegranates and put them on the
chains
and he reared up the pillars before the temple one on the right
hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the
right hand jachin and the name of that on the left boaz
moreover he made an altar of brass twenty cubits the length
thereof and twenty cubits the breadth thereof and ten cubits the
height thereof
also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round
in compass and five cubits the height thereof and a line of thirty
cubits did compass it round about
and under it was the similitude of oxen which did compass it
round about ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about two rows
of oxen were cast when it was cast
it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and
three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and
three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them
and all their hinder parts were inward
and the thickness of it was an handbreadth and the brim of it
like the work of the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies and it
received and held three thousand baths
he made also ten lavers and put five on the right hand and five
on the left to wash in them such things as they offered for the
burnt offering they washed in them but the sea was for the priests to
wash in
and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form and
set them in the temple five on the right hand and five on the left
he made also ten tables and placed them in the temple five on
the right side and five on the left and he made an hundred basons of
gold
furthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court
and doors for the court and overlaid the doors of them with brass
and he set the sea on the right side of the east end over
against the south
and huram made the pots and the shovels and the basons and
huram finished the work that he was to make for king solomon for the
house of god  to wit the two pillars and the pommels and the
chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars and the two
wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the
top of the pillars  and four hundred pomegranates on the two
wreaths two rows of pomegranates on each wreath to cover the two
pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars
he made also bases and lavers made he upon the bases  one
sea and twelve oxen under it
the pots also and the shovels and the fleshhooks and all their
instruments did huram his father make to king solomon for the house
of the lord of bright brass
in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground
between succoth and zeredathah
thus solomon made all these vessels in great abundance for the
weight of the brass could not be found out
and solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of god
the golden altar also and the tables whereon the shewbread was set
moreover the candlesticks with their lamps that they should burn
after the manner before the oracle of pure gold  and the
flowers and the lamps and the tongs made he of gold and that
perfect gold  and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons
and the censers of pure gold and the entry of the house the inner
doors thereof for the most holy place and the doors of the house of
the temple were of gold
thus all the work that solomon made for the house of the lord was
finished and solomon brought in all the things that david his father
had dedicated and the silver and the gold and all the instruments
put he among the treasures of the house of god
then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of
the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto
jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the
city of david which is zion
wherefore all the men of israel assembled themselves unto the king
in the feast which was in the seventh month
and all the elders of israel came and the levites took up the
ark
and they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the
congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle
these did the priests and the levites bring up
also king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were
assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which
could not be told nor numbered for multitude
and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord
unto his place to the oracle of the house into the most holy place
even under the wings of the cherubims  for the cherubims spread
forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered
the ark and the staves thereof above
and they drew out the staves of the ark that the ends of the
staves were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not
seen without and there it is unto this day
there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which moses put
therein at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of
israel when they came out of egypt
and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy
place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did
not then wait by course  also the levites which were the singers
all of them of asaph of heman of jeduthun with their sons and their
brethren being arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries
and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them an
hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets  it came even
to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound
to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up
their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick
and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth
for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house
of the lord  so that the priests could not stand to minister by
reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of
god
then said solomon the lord hath said that he would dwell in the
thick darkness
but i have built an house of habitation for thee and a place for
thy dwelling for ever
and the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation
of israel and all the congregation of israel stood
and he said blessed be the lord god of israel who hath with his
hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father david
saying  since the day that i brought forth my people out of the
land of egypt i chose no city among all the tribes of israel to build
an house in that my name might be there neither chose i any man to
be a ruler over my people israel  but i have chosen jerusalem
that my name might be there and have chosen david to be over my
people israel
now it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for
the name of the lord god of israel
but the lord said to david my father forasmuch as it was in thine
heart to build an house for my name thou didst well in that it was in
thine heart  notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house but
thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the
house for my name
the lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken
for i am risen up in the room of david my father and am set on the
throne of israel as the lord promised and have built the house for
the name of the lord god of israel
and in it have i put the ark wherein is the covenant of the
lord that he made with the children of israel
and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all
the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands  for
solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long and five
cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of
the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees
before all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands
toward heaven
and said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in the
heaven nor in the earth which keepest covenant and shewest mercy
unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts
thou which hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou
hast promised him and spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it
with thine hand as it is this day
now therefore o lord god of israel keep with thy servant david
my father that which thou hast promised him saying there shall not
fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of israel yet so
that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law as thou
hast walked before me
now then o lord god of israel let thy word be verified which
thou hast spoken unto thy servant david
but will god in very deed dwell with men on the earth behold
heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less
this house which i have built   have respect therefore to the
prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to
hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before
thee  that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night
upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name
there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward
this place
hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant and of
thy people israel which they shall make toward this place hear thou
from thy dwelling place even from heaven and when thou hearest
forgive
if a man sin against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him
to make him swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house
then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servants by
requiting the wicked by recompensing his way upon his own head and
by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his
righteousness
and if thy people israel be put to the worse before the enemy
because they have sinned against thee and shall return and confess
thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house
then hear thou from the heavens and forgive the sin of thy
people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to
them and to their fathers
when the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they
have sinned against thee yet if they pray toward this place and
confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou dost afflict
them  then hear thou from heaven and forgive the sin of thy
servants and of thy people israel when thou hast taught them the
good way wherein they should walk and send rain upon thy land which
thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance
if there be dearth in the land if there be pestilence if there
be blasting or mildew locusts or caterpillers if their enemies
besiege them in the cities of their land whatsoever sore or
whatsoever sickness there be  then what prayer or what
supplication soever shall be made of any man or of all thy people
israel when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief and
shall spread forth his hands in this house  then hear thou from
heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and render unto every man
according unto all his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou only
knowest the hearts of the children of men  that they may fear
thee to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou
gavest unto our fathers
moreover concerning the stranger which is not of thy people
israel but is come from a far country for thy great names sake and
thy mighty hand and thy stretched out arm if they come and pray in
this house  then hear thou from the heavens even from thy
dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to
thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name and fear
thee as doth thy people israel and may know that this house which i
have built is called by thy name
if thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that
thou shalt send them and they pray unto thee toward this city which
thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name
then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication
and maintain their cause
if they sin against thee for there is no man which sinneth
not and thou be angry with them and deliver them over before their
enemies and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or
near  yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are
carried captive and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their
captivity saying we have sinned we have done amiss and have dealt
wickedly  if they return to thee with all their heart and with
all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have
carried them captives and pray toward their land which thou gavest
unto their fathers and toward the city which thou hast chosen and
toward the house which i have built for thy name  then hear thou
from the heavens even from thy dwelling place their prayer and their
supplications and maintain their cause and forgive thy people which
have sinned against thee
now my god let i beseech thee thine eyes be open and let
thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place
now therefore arise o lord god into thy resting place thou
and the ark of thy strength let thy priests o lord god be clothed
with salvation and let thy saints rejoice in goodness
o lord god turn not away the face of thine anointed remember
the mercies of david thy servant
now when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down
from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and
the glory of the lord filled the house
and the priests could not enter into the house of the lord
because the glory of the lord had filled the lords house
and when all the children of israel saw how the fire came down
and the glory of the lord upon the house they bowed themselves with
their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshipped and
praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for
ever
then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
lord
and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand
oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all
the people dedicated the house of god
and the priests waited on their offices the levites also with
instruments of musick of the lord which david the king had made to
praise the lord because his mercy endureth for ever when david
praised by their ministry and the priests sounded trumpets before
them and all israel stood
moreover solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before
the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings and the
fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar which solomon had
made was not able to receive the burnt offerings and the meat
offerings and the fat
also at the same time solomon kept the feast seven days and all
israel with him a very great congregation from the entering in of
hamath unto the river of egypt
and in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly for they kept
the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days
and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent
the people away into their tents glad and merry in heart for the
goodness that the lord had shewed unto david and to solomon and to
israel his people
thus solomon finished the house of the lord and the kings
house and all that came into solomons heart to make in the house of
the lord and in his own house he prosperously effected
and the lord appeared to solomon by night and said unto him i
have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for an
house of sacrifice
if i shut up heaven that there be no rain or if i command the
locusts to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people
if my people which are called by my name shall humble
themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked
ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and
will heal their land
now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer
that is made in this place
for now have i chosen and sanctified this house that my name may
be there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there
perpetually
and as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father
walked and do according to all that i have commanded thee and shalt
observe my statutes and my judgments  then will i stablish the
throne of thy kingdom according as i have covenanted with david thy
father saying there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel
but if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments
which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and
worship them  then will i pluck them up by the roots out of my
land which i have given them and this house which i have sanctified
for my name will i cast out of my sight and will make it to be a
proverb and a byword among all nations
and this house which is high shall be an astonishment to every
one that passeth by it so that he shall say why hath the lord done
thus unto this land and unto this house   and it shall be
answered because they forsook the lord god of their fathers which
brought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other
gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought
all this evil upon them
and it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein solomon
had built the house of the lord and his own house  that the
cities which huram had restored to solomon solomon built them and
caused the children of israel to dwell there
and solomon went to hamathzobah and prevailed against it
and he built tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities
which he built in hamath
also he built bethhoron the upper and bethhoron the nether
fenced cities with walls gates and bars  and baalath and all
the store cities that solomon had and all the chariot cities and the
cities of the horsemen and all that solomon desired to build in
jerusalem and in lebanon and throughout all the land of his
dominion
as for all the people that were left of the hittites and the
amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites
which were not of israel  but of their children who were left
after them in the land whom the children of israel consumed not them
did solomon make to pay tribute until this day
but of the children of israel did solomon make no servants for his
work but they were men of war and chief of his captains and
captains of his chariots and horsemen
and these were the chief of king solomons officers even two
hundred and fifty that bare rule over the people
and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of
david unto the house that he had built for her for he said my wife
shall not dwell in the house of david king of israel because the
places are holy whereunto the ark of the lord hath come
then solomon offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the altar
of the lord which he had built before the porch  even after a
certain rate every day offering according to the commandment of
moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn
feasts three times in the year even in the feast of unleavened
bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles
and he appointed according to the order of david his father the
courses of the priests to their service and the levites to their
charges to praise and minister before the priests as the duty of
every day required the porters also by their courses at every gate
for so had david the man of god commanded
and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the
priests and levites concerning any matter or concerning the
treasures
now all the work of solomon was prepared unto the day of the
foundation of the house of the lord and until it was finished so the
house of the lord was perfected
then went solomon to eziongeber and to eloth at the sea side in
the land of edom
and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships and
servants that had knowledge of the sea and they went with the
servants of solomon to ophir and took thence four hundred and fifty
talents of gold and brought them to king solomon
and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came
to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very great
company and camels that bare spices and gold in abundance and
precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with
him of all that was in her heart
and solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hid
from solomon which he told her not
and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and
the house that he had built  and the meat of his table and the
sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and
their apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his ascent
by which he went up into the house of the lord there was no more
spirit in her
and she said to the king it was a true report which i heard in
mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom  howbeit i believed
not their words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold
the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me for thou
exceedest the fame that i heard
happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants which stand
continually before thee and hear thy wisdom
blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee
on his throne to be king for the lord thy god because thy god loved
israel to establish them for ever therefore made he thee king over
them to do judgment and justice
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and
of spices great abundance and precious stones neither was there any
such spice as the queen of sheba gave king solomon
and the servants also of huram and the servants of solomon
which brought gold from ophir brought algum trees and precious
stones
and the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the
lord and to the kings palace and harps and psalteries for singers
and there were none such seen before in the land of judah
and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire
whatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the king
so she turned and went away to her own land she and her servants
now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six
hundred and threescore and six talents of gold  beside that which
chapmen and merchants brought and all the kings of arabia and
governors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon
and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six
hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target
and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold three hundred
shekels of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house
of the forest of lebanon
moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it
with pure gold
and there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold
which were fastened to the throne and stays on each side of the
sitting place and two lions standing by the stays  and twelve
lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps
there was not the like made in any kingdom
and all the drinking vessels of king solomon were of gold and
all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure
gold none were of silver it was not any thing accounted of in the
days of solomon
for the kings ships went to tarshish with the servants of huram
every three years once came the ships of tarshish bringing gold and
silver ivory and apes and peacocks
and king solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and
wisdom
and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon to
hear his wisdom that god had put in his heart
and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and
vessels of gold and raiment harness and spices horses and mules
a rate year by year
and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and
twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the chariot cities and
with the king at jerusalem
and he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
land of the philistines and to the border of egypt
and the king made silver in jerusalem as stones and cedar trees
made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance
and they brought unto solomon horses out of egypt and out of all
lands
now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last are they not
written in the book of nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of
ahijah the shilonite and in the visions of iddo the seer against
jeroboam the son of nebat   and solomon reigned in jerusalem over
all israel forty years
and solomon slept with his fathers and he was buried in the city
of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead
and rehoboam went to shechem for to shechem were all israel come
to make him king
and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was in
egypt whither he fled from the presence of solomon the king heard
it that jeroboam returned out of egypt
and they sent and called him so jeroboam and all israel came and
spake to rehoboam saying  thy father made our yoke grievous now
therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and
his heavy yoke that he put upon us and we will serve thee
and he said unto them come again unto me after three days and
the people departed
and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel
give ye me to return answer to this people   and they spake unto
him saying if thou be kind to this people and please them and
speak good words to them they will be thy servants for ever
but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took
counsel with the young men that were brought up with him that stood
before him
and he said unto them what advice give ye that we may return
answer to this people which have spoken to me saying ease somewhat
the yoke that thy father did put upon us   and the young men
that were brought up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou
answer the people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our
yoke heavy but make thou it somewhat lighter for us thus shalt thou
say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my fathers
loins
for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you i will put more
to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise
you with scorpions
so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam on the third
day as the king bade saying come again to me on the third day
and the king answered them roughly and king rehoboam forsook
the counsel of the old men  and answered them after the advice
of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will
add thereto my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise
you with scorpions
so the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was of
god that the lord might perform his word which he spake by the hand
of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat
and when all israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in
david  and we have none inheritance in the son of jesse every man to
your tents o israel and now david see to thine own house so all
israel went to their tents
but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of
judah rehoboam reigned over them
then king rehoboam sent hadoram that was over the tribute and
the children of israel stoned him with stones that he died but king
rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to
jerusalem
and israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day
and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he gathered of the house
of judah and benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men
which were warriors to fight against israel that he might bring the
kingdom again to rehoboam
but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying
speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all
israel in judah and benjamin saying  thus saith the lord ye
shall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man to
his house for this thing is done of me and they obeyed the words of
the lord and returned from going against jeroboam
and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built cities for defence in
judah
he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa  and bethzur
and shoco and adullam  and gath and mareshah and ziph
and adoraim and lachish and azekah  and zorah and aijalon
and hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fenced cities
and he fortified the strong holds and put captains in them and
store of victual and of oil and wine
and in every several city he put shields and spears and made
them exceeding strong having judah and benjamin on his side
and the priests and the levites that were in all israel resorted
to him out of all their coasts
for the levites left their suburbs and their possession and
came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had cast them
off from executing the priests office unto the lord  and he
ordained him priests for the high places and for the devils and for
the calves which he had made
and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their
hearts to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrifice
unto the lord god of their fathers
so they strengthened the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the
son of solomon strong three years for three years they walked in the
way of david and solomon
and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son
of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse
which bare him children jeush and shamariah and zaham
and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom which
bare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith
and rehoboam loved maachah the daughter of absalom above all his
wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and threescore
concubines and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore
daughters   and rehoboam made abijah the son of maachah the
chief to be ruler among his brethren for he thought to make him
king
and he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his children
throughout all the countries of judah and benjamin unto every fenced
city and he gave them victual in abundance and he desired many
wives
and it came to pass when rehoboam had established the kingdom
and had strengthened himself he forsook the law of the lord and all
israel with him
and it came to pass that in the fifth year of king rehoboam
shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because they had
transgressed against the lord  with twelve hundred chariots and
threescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number that
came with him out of egypt the lubims the sukkiims and the
ethiopians
and he took the fenced cities which pertained to judah and came
to jerusalem
then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the princes of
judah that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak
and said unto them thus saith the lord ye have forsaken me and
therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak
whereupon the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves
and they said the lord is righteous
and when the lord saw that they humbled themselves the word of
the lord came to shemaiah saying they have humbled themselves
therefore i will not destroy them but i will grant them some
deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem by
the hand of shishak
nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my
service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries
so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away
the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the
kings house he took all he carried away also the shields of gold
which solomon had made
instead of which king rehoboam made shields of brass and
committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard that kept the
entrance of the kings house
and when the king entered into the house of the lord the guard
came and fetched them and brought them again into the guard chamber
and when he humbled himself the wrath of the lord turned from
him that he would not destroy him altogether and also in judah
things went well
so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem and reigned
for rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign and
he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord had
chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his
mothers name was naamah an ammonitess
and he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the
lord
now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not written
in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concerning
genealogies and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam
continually
and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city
of david and abijah his son reigned in his stead
now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign
over judah
he reigned three years in jerusalem his mothers name also was
michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there was war between
abijah and jeroboam
and abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of
war even four hundred thousand chosen men jeroboam also set the
battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men
being mighty men of valour
and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in mount
ephraim and said hear me thou jeroboam and all israel  ought
ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over
israel to david for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of
salt   yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the
son of david is risen up and hath rebelled against his lord
and there are gathered unto him vain men the children of belial
and have strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon
when rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand
them
and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand
of the sons of david and ye be a great multitude and there are with
your golden calves which jeroboam made you for gods
have ye not cast out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron
and the levites and have made you priests after the manner of the
nations of other lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself
with a young bullock and seven rams the same may be a priest of them
that are no gods
but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken
him and the priests which minister unto the lord are the sons of
aaron and the levites wait upon their business  and they burn
unto the lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and
sweet incense the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure
table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn
every evening for we keep the charge of the lord our god but ye have
forsaken him
and behold god himself is with us for our captain and his
priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you o children of
israel fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers for ye
shall not prosper
but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them so
they were before judah and the ambushment was behind them
and when judah looked back behold the battle was before and
behind and they cried unto the lord and the priests sounded with the
trumpets
then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judah
shouted it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel
before abijah and judah
and the children of israel fled before judah and god delivered
them into their hand
and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so
there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men
thus the children of israel were brought under at that time and
the children of judah prevailed because they relied upon the lord god
of their fathers
and abijah pursued after jeroboam and took cities from him
bethel with the towns thereof and jeshanah with the towns thereof
and ephraim with the towns thereof
neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
abijah and the lord struck him and he died
but abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives and begat
twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters
and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his
sayings are written in the story of the prophet iddo
so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city
of david and asa his son reigned in his stead in his days the land
was quiet ten years
and asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the lord
his god  for he took away the altars of the strange gods and the
high places and brake down the images and cut down the groves
and commanded judah to seek the lord god of their fathers and to do
the law and the commandment
also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places
and the images and the kingdom was quiet before him
and he built fenced cities in judah for the land had rest and
he had no war in those years because the lord had given him rest
therefore he said unto judah let us build these cities and make
about them walls and towers gates and bars while the land is yet
before us because we have sought the lord our god we have sought
him and he hath given us rest on every side so they built and
prospered
and asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears out of
judah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bare shields
and drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these were
mighty men of valour
and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host
of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto
mareshah
then asa went out against him and they set the battle in array
in the valley of zephathah at mareshah
and asa cried unto the lord his god and said lord it is
nothing with thee to help whether with many or with them that have
no power help us o lord our god for we rest on thee and in thy
name we go against this multitude o lord thou art our god let no
man prevail against thee
so the lord smote the ethiopians before asa and before judah
and the ethiopians fled
and asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
gerar and the ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recover
themselves for they were destroyed before the lord and before his
host and they carried away very much spoil
and they smote all the cities round about gerar for the fear of
the lord came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for there
was exceeding much spoil in them
they smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep and
camels in abundance and returned to jerusalem
and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded  and
he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all
judah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye be with him and if
ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will
forsake you
now for a long season israel hath been without the true god and
without a teaching priest and without law
but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god of
israel and sought him he was found of them
and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor
to him that came in but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants
of the countries
and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city for god did
vex them with all adversity
be ye strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for your
work shall be rewarded
and when asa heard these words and the prophecy of oded the
prophet he took courage and put away the abominable idols out of all
the land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he had
taken from mount ephraim and renewed the altar of the lord that was
before the porch of the lord
and he gathered all judah and benjamin and the strangers with
them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to
him out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his god
was with him
so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third
month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa
and they offered unto the lord the same time of the spoil which
they had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep
and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their
fathers with all their heart and with all their soul  that
whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to
death whether small or great whether man or woman
and they sware unto the lord with a loud voice and with
shouting and with trumpets and with cornets
and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all
their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found
of them and the lord gave them rest round about
and also concerning maachah the mother of asa the king he
removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove
and asa cut down her idol and stamped it and burnt it at the brook
kidron
but the high places were not taken away out of israel
nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days
and he brought into the house of god the things that his father
had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and gold
and vessels
and there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of
the reign of asa
in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of
israel came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he
might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah
then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the
house of the lord and of the kings house and sent to benhadad king
of syria that dwelt at damascus saying  there is a league
between me and thee as there was between my father and thy father
behold i have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with
baasha king of israel that he may depart from me
and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of
his armies against the cities of israel and they smote ijon and dan
and abelmaim and all the store cities of naphtali
and it came to pass when baasha heard it that he left off
building of ramah and let his work cease
then asa the king took all judah and they carried away the
stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha was
building and he built therewith geba and mizpah
and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and
said unto him because thou hast relied on the king of syria and not
relied on the lord thy god therefore is the host of the king of syria
escaped out of thine hand
were not the ethiopians and the lubims a huge host with very
many chariots and horsemen yet because thou didst rely on the lord
he delivered them into thine hand
for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole
earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is
perfect toward him herein thou hast done foolishly therefore from
henceforth thou shalt have wars
then asa was wroth with the seer and put him in a prison house
for he was in a rage with him because of this thing and asa oppressed
some of the people the same time
and behold the acts of asa first and last lo they are
written in the book of the kings of judah and israel
and asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
in his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease
he sought not to the lord but to the physicians
and asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth
year of his reign
and they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had made for
himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filled
with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the
apothecaries art and they made a very great burning for him
and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthened
himself against israel
and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of judah and set
garrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of ephraim which
asa his father had taken
and the lord was with jehoshaphat because he walked in the first
ways of his father david and sought not unto baalim  but sought
to the lord god of his father and walked in his commandments and not
after the doings of israel
therefore the lord stablished the kingdom in his hand and all
judah brought to jehoshaphat presents and he had riches and honour in
abundance
and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord moreover he
took away the high places and groves out of judah
also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes even
to benhail and to obadiah and to zechariah and to nethaneel and to
michaiah to teach in the cities of judah
and with them he sent levites even shemaiah and nethaniah and
zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah
and tobijah and tobadonijah levites and with them elishama and
jehoram priests
and they taught in judah and had the book of the law of the lord
with them and went about throughout all the cities of judah and
taught the people
and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands
that were round about judah so that they made no war against
jehoshaphat
also some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents and
tribute silver and the arabians brought him flocks seven thousand
and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats
and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in judah
castles and cities of store
and he had much business in the cities of judah and the men of
war mighty men of valour were in jerusalem
and these are the numbers of them according to the house of
their fathers of judah the captains of thousands adnah the chief
and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand
and next to him was jehohanan the captain and with him two
hundred and fourscore thousand
and next him was amasiah the son of zichri who willingly
offered himself unto the lord and with him two hundred thousand
mighty men of valour
and of benjamin eliada a mighty man of valour and with him
armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand
and next him was jehozabad and with him an hundred and
fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war
these waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the
fenced cities throughout all judah
now jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance and joined
affinity with ahab
and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria and ahab
killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he
had with him and persuaded him to go up with him to ramothgilead
and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah wilt
thou go with me to ramothgilead and he answered him i am as thou
art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war
and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray
thee at the word of the lord to day
therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets four
hundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to
battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for god will deliver
it into the kings hand
but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord
besides that we might enquire of him   and the king of israel
said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may enquire of
the lord but i hate him for he never prophesied good unto me but
always evil the same is micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphat
said let not the king say so
and the king of israel called for one of his officers and said
fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla
and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either
of them on his throne clothed in their robes and they sat in a void
place at the entering in of the gate of samaria and all the prophets
prophesied before them
and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horns of iron
and said thus saith the lord with these thou shalt push syria until
they be consumed
and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to
ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand
of the king
and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake to him
saying behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king
with one assent let thy word therefore i pray thee be like one of
theirs and speak thou good
and micaiah said as the lord liveth even what my god saith
that will i speak
and when he was come to the king the king said unto him
micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear
and he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered into
your hand
and the king said to him how many times shall i adjure thee
that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the lord
then he said i did see all israel scattered upon the mountains
as sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said these have no
master let them return therefore every man to his house in peace
and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee
that he would not prophesy good unto me but evil   again he
said therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting upon
his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and
on his left
and the lord said who shall entice ahab king of israel that he
may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one spake saying after this
manner and another saying after that manner
then there came out a spirit and stood before the lord and
said i will entice him and the lord said unto him wherewith
and he said i will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all
his prophets and the lord said thou shalt entice him and thou shalt
also prevail go out and do even so
now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the
mouth of these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil against
thee
then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah
upon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from
me to speak unto thee   and micaiah said behold thou shalt see
on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself
then the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carry him
back to amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son
and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and
feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until
i return in peace
and micaiah said if thou certainly return in peace then hath
not the lord spoken by me and he said hearken all ye people
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up
to ramothgilead
and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise
myself and i will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes so the
king of israel disguised himself and they went to the battle
now the king of syria had commanded the captains of the chariots
that were with him saying fight ye not with small or great save
only with the king of israel
and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw
jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel therefore they
compassed about him to fight but jehoshaphat cried out and the lord
helped him and god moved them to depart from him
for it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots
perceived that it was not the king of israel they turned back again
from pursuing him
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of
israel between the joints of the harness therefore he said to his
chariot man turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of the
host for i am wounded
and the battle increased that day howbeit the king of israel
stayed himself up in his chariot against the syrians until the even
and about the time of the sun going down he died
and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace
to jerusalem
and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him and
said to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the ungodly and love
them that hate the lord therefore is wrath upon thee from before the
lord
nevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thou
hast taken away the groves out of the land and hast prepared thine
heart to seek god
and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again through
the people from beersheba to mount ephraim and brought them back unto
the lord god of their fathers
and he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of
judah city by city  and said to the judges take heed what ye
do for ye judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in the
judgment
wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and
do it for there is no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect of
persons nor taking of gifts
moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites and of
the priests and of the chief of the fathers of israel for the
judgment of the lord and for controversies when they returned to
jerusalem
and he charged them saying thus shall ye do in the fear of the
lord faithfully and with a perfect heart
and what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
dwell in your cities between blood and blood between law and
commandment statutes and judgments ye shall even warn them that they
trespass not against the lord and so wrath come upon you and upon
your brethren this do and ye shall not trespass
and behold amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters
of the lord and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the house
of judah for all the kings matters also the levites shall be
officers before you deal courageously and the lord shall be with the
good
it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and
the children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came
against jehoshaphat to battle
then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh
a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria
and behold they be in hazazontamar which is engedi
and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and
proclaimed a fast throughout all judah
and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord
even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord
and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem
in the house of the lord before the new court  and said o lord
god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven and rulest not thou
over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not
power and might so that none is able to withstand thee   art not
thou our god who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before
thy people israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend for
ever   and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary
therein for thy name saying  if when evil cometh upon us as
the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this
house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry
unto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help
and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seir
whom thou wouldest not let israel invade when they came out of the
land of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not
behold i say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy
possession which thou hast given us to inherit
o our god wilt thou not judge them for we have no might
against this great company that cometh against us neither know we
what to do but our eyes are upon thee
and all judah stood before the lord with their little ones
their wives and their children
then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the
son of jeiel the son of mattaniah a levite of the sons of asaph
came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation
and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem
and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid
nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not
yours but gods
to morrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the
cliff of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before
the wilderness of jeruel
ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand
ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and
jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against them
for the lord will be with you
and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and
all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord
worshipping the lord
and the levites of the children of the kohathites and of the
children of the korhites stood up to praise the lord god of israel
with a loud voice on high
and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the
wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and
said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe in
the lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets
so shall ye prosper
and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers
unto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness as they
went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy
endureth for ever
and when they began to sing and to praise the lord set
ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which
were come against judah and they were smitten
for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the
inhabitants of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when
they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir every one helped to
destroy another
and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness
they looked unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodies
fallen to the earth and none escaped
and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil
of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead
bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves
more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering
of the spoil it was so much
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of
berachah for there they blessed the lord therefore the name of the
same place was called the valley of berachah unto this day
then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and
jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with
joy for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies
and they came to jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
trumpets unto the house of the lord
and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of those countries
when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemies of
israel
so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet for his god gave him rest
round about
and jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty and five years
old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in
jerusalem
and his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi
and he walked in the way of asa his father and departed not
from it doing that which was right in the sight of the lord
howbeit the high places were not taken away for as yet the
people had not prepared their hearts unto the god of their fathers
now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last behold
they are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani who is
mentioned in the book of the kings of israel
and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with
ahaziah king of israel who did very wickedly  and he joined
himself with him to make ships to go to tarshish and they made the
ships in eziongaber
then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesied against
jehoshaphat saying because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah
the lord hath broken thy works and the ships were broken that they
were not able to go to tarshish
now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his
fathers in the city of david and jehoram his son reigned in his
stead
and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel
and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these
were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel
and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold
and of precious things with fenced cities in judah but the kingdom
gave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn
now when jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father he
strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword and
divers also of the princes of israel
jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign and
he reigned eight years in jerusalem
and he walked in the way of the kings of israel like as did the
house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he wrought
that which was evil in the eyes of the lord
howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david because of
the covenant that he had made with david and as he promised to give a
light to him and to his sons for ever
in his days the edomites revolted from under the dominion of
judah and made themselves a king
then jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariots
with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites which
compassed him in and the captains of the chariots
so the edomites revolted from under the hand of judah unto this
day
the same time also did libnah revolt from under his hand because he
had forsaken the lord god of his fathers
moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah and
caused the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit fornication and
compelled judah thereto
and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet saying
thus saith the lord god of david thy father because thou hast not
walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of asa
king of judah  but hast walked in the way of the kings of
israel and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go a
whoring like to the whoredoms of the house of ahab and also hast
slain thy brethren of thy fathers house which were better than
thyself  behold with a great plague will the lord smite thy
people and thy children and thy wives and all thy goods  and
thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy
bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day
moreover the lord stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the
philistines and of the arabians that were near the ethiopians
and they came up into judah and brake into it and carried away all
the substance that was found in the kings house and his sons also
and his wives so that there was never a son left him save jehoahaz
the youngest of his sons
and after all this the lord smote him in his bowels with an
incurable disease
and it came to pass that in process of time after the end of
two years his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness so he died
of sore diseases and his people made no burning for him like the
burning of his fathers
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he
reigned in jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired
howbeit they buried him in the city of david but not in the
sepulchres of the kings
and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son
king in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians to
the camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king
of judah reigned
forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and
he reigned one year in jerusalem his mothers name also was athaliah
the daughter of omri
he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother
was his counsellor to do wickedly
wherefore he did evil in the sight of the lord like the house of
ahab for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to
his destruction
he walked also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son
of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at
ramothgilead and the syrians smote joram
and he returned to be healed in jezreel because of the wounds
which were given him at ramah when he fought with hazael king of
syria and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see
jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel because he was sick
and the destruction of ahaziah was of god by coming to joram for
when he was come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of
nimshi whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab
and it came to pass that when jehu was executing judgment upon
the house of ahab and found the princes of judah and the sons of the
brethren of ahaziah that ministered to ahaziah he slew them
and he sought ahaziah and they caught him for he was hid in
samaria and brought him to jehu and when they had slain him they
buried him because said they he is the son of jehoshaphat who
sought the lord with all his heart so the house of ahaziah had no
power to keep still the kingdom
but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was
dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of
judah
but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son
of ahaziah and stole him from among the kings sons that were slain
and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber so jehoshabeath the
daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she
was the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she slew
him not
and he was with them hid in the house of god six years and
athaliah reigned over the land
and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself and took
the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the
son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son of
adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him
and they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of all
the cities of judah and the chief of the fathers of israel and they
came to jerusalem
and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
house of god and he said unto them behold the kings son shall
reign as the lord hath said of the sons of david
this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you entering
on the sabbath of the priests and of the levites shall be porters of
the doors  and a third part shall be at the kings house and a
third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be
in the courts of the house of the lord
but let none come into the house of the lord save the priests
and they that minister of the levites they shall go in for they are
holy but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord
and the levites shall compass the king round about every man
with his weapons in his hand and whosoever else cometh into the
house he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he
cometh in and when he goeth out
so the levites and all judah did according to all things that
jehoiada the priest had commanded and took every man his men that
were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the
sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses
moreover jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
hundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been king
davids which were in the house of god
and he set all the people every man having his weapon in his
hand from the right side of the temple to the left side of the
temple along by the altar and the temple by the king round about
then they brought out the kings son and put upon him the
crown and gave him the testimony and made him king and jehoiada and
his sons anointed him and said god save the king
now when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
praising the king she came to the people into the house of the lord
and she looked and behold the king stood at his pillar at the
entering in and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all the
people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also the
singers with instruments of musick and such as taught to sing praise
then athaliah rent her clothes and said treason treason
then jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth of the
ranges and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword for
the priest said slay her not in the house of the lord
so they laid hands on her and when she was come to the entering
of the horse gate by the kings house they slew her there
and jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the
people and between the king that they should be the lords people
then all the people went to the house of baal and brake it
down and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew mattan
the priest of baal before the altars
also jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the lord by
the hand of the priests the levites whom david had distributed in the
house of the lord to offer the burnt offerings of the lord as it is
written in the law of moses with rejoicing and with singing as it
was ordained by david
and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the lord
that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in
and he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the
governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought
down the king from the house of the lord and they came through the
high gate into the kings house and set the king upon the throne of
the kingdom
and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet
after that they had slain athaliah with the sword
joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned
forty years in jerusalem his mothers name also was zibiah of
beersheba
and joash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all
the days of jehoiada the priest
and jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons and
daughters
and it came to pass after this that joash was minded to repair
the house of the lord
and he gathered together the priests and the levites and said to
them go out unto the cities of judah and gather of all israel money
to repair the house of your god from year to year and see that ye
hasten the matter howbeit the levites hastened it not
and the king called for jehoiada the chief and said unto him
why hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah and
out of jerusalem the collection according to the commandment of moses
the servant of the lord and of the congregation of israel for the
tabernacle of witness   for the sons of athaliah that wicked
woman had broken up the house of god and also all the dedicated
things of the house of the lord did they bestow upon baalim
and at the kings commandment they made a chest and set it
without at the gate of the house of the lord
and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem to
bring in to the lord the collection that moses the servant of god laid
upon israel in the wilderness
and all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in
and cast into the chest until they had made an end
now it came to pass that at what time the chest was brought
unto the kings office by the hand of the levites and when they saw
that there was much money the kings scribe and the high priests
officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to his
place again thus they did day by day and gathered money in
abundance
and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
service of the house of the lord and hired masons and carpenters to
repair the house of the lord and also such as wrought iron and brass
to mend the house of the lord
so the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them and
they set the house of god in his state and strengthened it
and when they had finished it they brought the rest of the
money before the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessels for the
house of the lord even vessels to minister and to offer withal and
spoons and vessels of gold and silver and they offered burnt
offerings in the house of the lord continually all the days of
jehoiada
but jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died an
hundred and thirty years old was he when he died
and they buried him in the city of david among the kings
because he had done good in israel both toward god and toward his
house
now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah and
made obeisance to the king then the king hearkened unto them
and they left the house of the lord god of their fathers and
served groves and idols and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for
this their trespass
yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the lord
and they testified against them but they would not give ear
and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada
the priest which stood above the people and said unto them thus
saith god why transgress ye the commandments of the lord that ye
cannot prosper because ye have forsaken the lord he hath also
forsaken you
and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at
the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord
thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiada
his father had done to him but slew his son and when he died he
said the lord look upon it and require it
and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of
syria came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem and
destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and
sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus
for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men
and the lord delivered a very great host into their hand because they
had forsaken the lord god of their fathers so they executed judgment
against joash
and when they were departed from him for they left him in
great diseases his own servants conspired against him for the blood
of the sons of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he
died and they buried him in the city of david but they buried him
not in the sepulchres of the kings
and these are they that conspired against him zabad the son of
shimeath an ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess
now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid
upon him and the repairing of the house of god behold they are
written in the story of the book of the kings and amaziah his son
reigned in his stead
amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and
he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers name
was jehoaddan of jerusalem
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord but not
with a perfect heart
now it came to pass when the kingdom was established to him
that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father
but he slew not their children but did as it is written in the
law in the book of moses where the lord commanded saying the
fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die
for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin
moreover amaziah gathered judah together and made them captains
over thousands and captains over hundreds according to the houses of
their fathers throughout all judah and benjamin and he numbered them
from twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousand
choice men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and
shield
he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
israel for an hundred talents of silver
but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not the
army of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel to wit
with all the children of ephraim
but if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battle god shall
make thee fall before the enemy for god hath power to help and to
cast down
and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the
hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel and the man
of god answered the lord is able to give thee much more than this
then amaziah separated them to wit the army that was come to
him out of ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger was
greatly kindled against judah and they returned home in great anger
and amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people and
went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir ten
thousand
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of judah
carry away captive and brought them unto the top of the rock and
cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in
pieces
but the soldiers of the army which amaziah sent back that they
should not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of judah from
samaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and
took much spoil
now it came to pass after that amaziah was come from the
slaughter of the edomites that he brought the gods of the children of
seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself before
them and burned incense unto them
wherefore the anger of the lord was kindled against amaziah and
he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him why hast thou sought
after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people
out of thine hand   and it came to pass as he talked with him
that the king said unto him art thou made of the kings counsel
forbear why shouldest thou be smitten then the prophet forbare and
said i know that god hath determined to destroy thee because thou
hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel
then amaziah king of judah took advice and sent to joash the
son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us
see one another in the face
and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying
the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon
saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a
wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle
thou sayest lo thou hast smitten the edomites and thine heart
lifteth thee up to boast abide now at home why shouldest thou meddle
to thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with
thee   but amaziah would not hear for it came of god that he
might deliver them into the hand of their enemies because they sought
after the gods of edom
so joash the king of israel went up and they saw one another in
the face both he and amaziah king of judah at bethshemesh which
belongeth to judah
and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled
every man to his tent
and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son
of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to
jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of
ephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubits
and he took all the gold and the silver and all the vessels
that were found in the house of god with obededom and the treasures
of the kings house the hostages also and returned to samaria
and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death
of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years
now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last behold are
they not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel
now after the time that amaziah did turn away from following the lord
they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to
lachish but they sent to lachish after him and slew him there
and they brought him upon horses and buried him with his
fathers in the city of judah
then all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years
old and made him king in the room of his father amaziah
he built eloth and restored it to judah after that the king
slept with his fathers
sixteen years old was uzziah when he began to reign and he
reigned fifty and two years in jerusalem his mothers name also was
jecoliah of jerusalem
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord
according to all that his father amaziah did
and he sought god in the days of zechariah who had understanding
in the visions of god and as long as he sought the lord god made him
to prosper
and he went forth and warred against the philistines and brake
down the wall of gath and the wall of jabneh and the wall of ashdod
and built cities about ashdod and among the philistines
and god helped him against the philistines and against the
arabians that dwelt in gurbaal and the mehunims
and the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah and his name spread
abroad even to the entering in of egypt for he strengthened himself
exceedingly
moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate and
at the valley gate and at the turning of the wall and fortified
them
also he built towers in the desert and digged many wells for
he had much cattle both in the low country and in the plains
husbandmen also and vine dressers in the mountains and in carmel
for he loved husbandry
moreover uzziah had an host of fighting men that went out to
war by bands according to the number of their account by the hand of
jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler under the hand of hananiah
one of the kings captains
the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
of valour were two thousand and six hundred
and under their hand was an army three hundred thousand and
seven thousand and five hundred that made war with mighty power to
help the king against the enemy
and uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields
and spears and helmets and habergeons and bows and slings to cast
stones
and he made in jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be
on the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stones
withal
and his name spread far abroad for he was marvellously helped till
he was strong
but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his
destruction for he transgressed against the lord his god and went
into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense
and azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscore
priests of the lord that were valiant men  and they withstood
uzziah the king and said unto him it appertaineth not unto thee
uzziah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests the sons of
aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary
for thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thine honour from
the lord god
then uzziah was wroth and had a censer in his hand to burn
incense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy even
rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord
from beside the incense altar
and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon
him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him
out from thence yea himself hasted also to go out because the lord
had smitten him
and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death and
dwelt in a several house being a leper for he was cut off from the
house of the lord and jotham his son was over the kings house
judging the people of the land
now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last did isaiah
the prophet the son of amoz write
so uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his
fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings for
they said he is a leper and jotham his son reigned in his stead
jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and
he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem his mothers name also was
jerushah the daughter of zadok
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord
according to all that his father uzziah did howbeit he entered not
into the temple of the lord and the people did yet corruptly
he built the high gate of the house of the lord and on the wall
of ophel he built much
moreover he built cities in the mountains of judah and in the
forests he built castles and towers
he fought also with the king of the ammonites and prevailed
against them and the children of ammon gave him the same year an
hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten
thousand of barley so much did the children of ammon pay unto him
both the second year and the third
so jotham became mighty because he prepared his ways before the
lord his god
now the rest of the acts of jotham and all his wars and his
ways lo they are written in the book of the kings of israel and
judah
he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and
reigned sixteen years in jerusalem
and jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the
city of david and ahaz his son reigned in his stead
ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned
sixteen years in jerusalem but he did not that which was right in the
sight of the lord like david his father  for he walked in the
ways of the kings of israel and made also molten images for baalim
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom and
burnt his children in the fire after the abominations of the heathen
whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel
he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on
the hills and under every green tree
wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of the
king of syria and they smote him and carried away a great multitude
of them captives and brought them to damascus and he was also
delivered into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with a
great slaughter
for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundred and twenty
thousand in one day which were all valiant men because they had
forsaken the lord god of their fathers
and zichri a mighty man of ephraim slew maaseiah the kings
son and azrikam the governor of the house and elkanah that was next
to the king
and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethren
two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also away
much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria
but a prophet of the lord was there whose name was oded and he
went out before the host that came to samaria and said unto them
behold because the lord god of your fathers was wroth with judah he
hath delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage
that reacheth up unto heaven
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of judah and
jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you but are there not with
you even with you sins against the lord your god   now hear me
therefore and deliver the captives again which ye have taken captive
of your brethren for the fierce wrath of the lord is upon you
then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim azariah
the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah
the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against them
that came from the war  and said unto them ye shall not bring
in the captives hither for whereas we have offended against the lord
already ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass for
our trespass is great and there is fierce wrath against israel
so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
princes and all the congregation
and the men which were expressed by name rose up and took the
captives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them
and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink
and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and
brought them to jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren
then they returned to samaria
at that time did king ahaz send unto the kings of assyria to
help him
for again the edomites had come and smitten judah and carried
away captives
the philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country
and of the south of judah and had taken bethshemesh and ajalon and
gederoth and shocho with the villages thereof and timnah with the
villages thereof gimzo also and the villages thereof and they dwelt
there
for the lord brought judah low because of ahaz king of israel
for he made judah naked and transgressed sore against the lord
and tilgathpilneser king of assyria came unto him and
distressed him but strengthened him not
for ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the lord and
out of the house of the king and of the princes and gave it unto the
king of assyria but he helped him not
and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against
the lord this is that king ahaz
for he sacrificed unto the gods of damascus which smote him
and he said because the gods of the kings of syria help them
therefore will i sacrifice to them that they may help me but they
were the ruin of him and of all israel
and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god and
cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doors
of the house of the lord and he made him altars in every corner of
jerusalem
and in every several city of judah he made high places to burn
incense unto other gods and provoked to anger the lord god of his
fathers
now the rest of his acts and of all his ways first and last
behold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel
and ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the
city even in jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchres
of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead
hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old
and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem and his mothers
name was abijah the daughter of zechariah
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord
according to all that david his father had done
he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the
doors of the house of the lord and repaired them
and he brought in the priests and the levites and gathered them
together into the east street  and said unto them hear me ye
levites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of the lord
god of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy
place
for our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil in
the eyes of the lord our god and have forsaken him and have turned
away their faces from the habitation of the lord and turned their
backs
also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the
lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the
holy place unto the god of israel
wherefore the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem and
he hath delivered them to trouble to astonishment and to hissing as
ye see with your eyes
for lo our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and
our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this
now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the lord god of
israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from us
my sons be not now negligent for the lord hath chosen you to
stand before him to serve him and that ye should minister unto him
and burn incense
then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the
son of azariah of the sons of the kohathites and of the sons of
merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel and of
the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah
and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the sons
of asaph zechariah and mattaniah  and of the sons of heman
jehiel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel
and they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and
came according to the commandment of the king by the words of the
lord to cleanse the house of the lord
and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
lord to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they
found in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the
lord and the levites took it to carry it out abroad into the brook
kidron
now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify
and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord
so they sanctified the house of the lord in eight days and in the
sixteenth day of the first month they made an end
then they went in to hezekiah the king and said we have
cleansed all the house of the lord and the altar of burnt offering
with all the vessels thereof and the shewbread table with all the
vessels thereof
moreover all the vessels which king ahaz in his reign did cast
away in his transgression have we prepared and sanctified and
behold they are before the altar of the lord
then hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the rulers of
the city and went up to the house of the lord
and they brought seven bullocks and seven rams and seven
lambs and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for
the sanctuary and for judah and he commanded the priests the sons of
aaron to offer them on the altar of the lord
so they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood
and sprinkled it on the altar likewise when they had killed the
rams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also the
lambs and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar
and they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before
the king and the congregation and they laid their hands upon them
and the priests killed them and they made reconciliation with
their blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all israel for
the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should
be made for all israel
and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbals
with psalteries and with harps according to the commandment of
david and of gad the kings seer and nathan the prophet for so was
the commandment of the lord by his prophets
and the levites stood with the instruments of david and the
priests with the trumpets
and hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
altar
and when the burnt offering began the song of the lord began also
with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by david king of
israel
and all the congregation worshipped and the singers sang and
the trumpeters sounded and all this continued until the burnt
offering was finished
and when they had made an end of offering the king and all that
were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped
moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levites
to sing praise unto the lord with the words of david and of asaph the
seer and they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads
and worshipped
then hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecrated
yourselves unto the lord come near and bring sacrifices and thank
offerings into the house of the lord and the congregation brought in
sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a free heart
burnt offerings
and the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation
brought was threescore and ten bullocks an hundred rams and two
hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the lord
and the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
thousand sheep
but the priests were too few so that they could not flay all
the burnt offerings wherefore their brethren the levites did help
them till the work was ended and until the other priests had
sanctified themselves for the levites were more upright in heart to
sanctify themselves than the priests
and also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat of
the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offering
so the service of the house of the lord was set in order
and hezekiah rejoiced and all the people that god had prepared
the people for the thing was done suddenly
and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also
to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of the
lord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel
for the king had taken counsel and his princes and all the
congregation in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month
for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had
not sanctified themselves sufficiently neither had the people
gathered themselves together to jerusalem
and the thing pleased the king and all the congregation
so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all
israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the
passover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem for they had not
done it of a long time in such sort as it was written
so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
throughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment of
the king saying ye children of israel turn again unto the lord god
of abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant of
you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyria
and be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren which
trespassed against the lord god of their fathers who therefore gave
them up to desolation as ye see
now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yield
yourselves unto the lord and enter into his sanctuary which he hath
sanctified for ever and serve the lord your god that the fierceness
of his wrath may turn away from you
for if ye turn again unto the lord your brethren and your
children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive so
that they shall come again into this land for the lord your god is
gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if ye
return unto him
so the posts passed from city to city through the country of
ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laughed them to
scorn and mocked them
nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled
themselves and came to jerusalem
also in judah the hand of god was to give them one heart to do
the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the
lord
and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast
of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation
and they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalem
and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the
brook kidron
then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
second month and the priests and the levites were ashamed and
sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offerings into the
house of the lord
and they stood in their place after their manner according to
the law of moses the man of god the priests sprinkled the blood
which they received of the hand of the levites
for there were many in the congregation that were not
sanctified therefore the levites had the charge of the killing of the
passovers for every one that was not clean to sanctify them unto the
lord
for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim and
manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did
they eat the passover otherwise than it was written but hezekiah
prayed for them saying the good lord pardon every one  that
prepareth his heart to seek god the lord god of his fathers though
he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary
and the lord hearkened to hezekiah and healed the people
and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem kept
the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the
levites and the priests praised the lord day by day singing with loud
instruments unto the lord
and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that taught
the good knowledge of the lord and they did eat throughout the feast
seven days offering peace offerings and making confession to the
lord god of their fathers
and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days
and they kept other seven days with gladness
for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congregation a
thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave to
the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and a
great number of priests sanctified themselves
and all the congregation of judah with the priests and the
levites and all the congregation that came out of israel and the
strangers that came out of the land of israel and that dwelt in
judah rejoiced
so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time of
solomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like in
jerusalem
then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people and
their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling
place even unto heaven
now when all this was finished all israel that were present went
out to the cities of judah and brake the images in pieces and cut
down the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out of
all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they had
utterly destroyed them all then all the children of israel returned
every man to his possession into their own cities
and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the levites
after their courses every man according to his service the priests
and levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to minister
and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the
lord
he appointed also the kings portion of his substance for the
burnt offerings to wit for the morning and evening burnt offerings
and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and
for the set feasts as it is written in the law of the lord
moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give
the portion of the priests and the levites that they might be
encouraged in the law of the lord
and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of
israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil
and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all
things brought they in abundantly
and concerning the children of israel and judah that dwelt in
the cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep
and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the lord
their god and laid them by heaps
in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps
and finished them in the seventh month
and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they
blessed the lord and his people israel
then hezekiah questioned with the priests and the levites
concerning the heaps
and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him
and said since the people began to bring the offerings into the house
of the lord we have had enough to eat and have left plenty for the
lord hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great
store
then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the
lord and they prepared them  and brought in the offerings and
the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully over which cononiah
the levite was ruler and shimei his brother was the next
and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth
and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were
overseers under the hand of cononiah and shimei his brother at the
commandment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house
of god
and kore the son of imnah the levite the porter toward the
east was over the freewill offerings of god to distribute the
oblations of the lord and the most holy things
and next him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah
amariah and shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their set
office to give to their brethren by courses as well to the great as
to the small  beside their genealogy of males from three years
old and upward even unto every one that entereth into the house of
the lord his daily portion for their service in their charges
according to their courses  both to the genealogy of the priests
by the house of their fathers and the levites from twenty years old
and upward in their charges by their courses  and to the
genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and
their daughters through all the congregation for in their set office
they sanctified themselves in holiness  also of the sons of
aaron the priests which were in the fields of the suburbs of their
cities in every several city the men that were expressed by name to
give portions to all the males among the priests and to all that were
reckoned by genealogies among the levites
and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah and wrought that
which was good and right and truth before the lord his god
and in every work that he began in the service of the house of
god and in the law and in the commandments to seek his god he did
it with all his heart and prospered
after these things and the establishment thereof sennacherib
king of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against the
fenced cities and thought to win them for himself
and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come and that he was
purposed to fight against jerusalem  he took counsel with his
princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which
were without the city and they did help him
so there was gathered much people together who stopped all the
fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land
saying why should the kings of assyria come and find much water
also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was
broken and raised it up to the towers and another wall without and
repaired millo in the city of david and made darts and shields in
abundance
and he set captains of war over the people and gathered them
together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spake
comfortably to them saying  be strong and courageous be not
afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitude
that is with him for there be more with us than with him  with
him is an arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us
and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the
words of hezekiah king of judah
after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servants to
jerusalem but he himself laid siege against lachish and all his
power with him unto hezekiah king of judah and unto all judah that
were at jerusalem saying  thus saith sennacherib king of
assyria whereon do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem
doth not hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by
famine and by thirst saying the lord our god shall deliver us out of
the hand of the king of assyria   hath not the same hezekiah
taken away his high places and his altars and commanded judah and
jerusalem saying ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense
upon it   know ye not what i and my fathers have done unto all
the people of other lands were the gods of the nations of those lands
any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand   who was
there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly
destroyed that could deliver his people out of mine hand that your
god should be able to deliver you out of mine hand   now
therefore let not hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on this
manner neither yet believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom
was able to deliver his people out of mine hand and out of the hand
of my fathers how much less shall your god deliver you out of mine
hand   and his servants spake yet more against the lord god and
against his servant hezekiah
he wrote also letters to rail on the lord god of israel and to
speak against him saying as the gods of the nations of other lands
have not delivered their people out of mine hand so shall not the god
of hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand
then they cried with a loud voice in the jews speech unto the
people of jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and to
trouble them that they might take the city
and they spake against the god of jerusalem as against the gods
of the people of the earth which were the work of the hands of man
and for this cause hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah the
son of amoz prayed and cried to heaven
and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of
valour and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of
assyria so he returned with shame of face to his own land and when
he was come into the house of his god they that came forth of his own
bowels slew him there with the sword
thus the lord saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalem
from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of
all other and guided them on every side
and many brought gifts unto the lord to jerusalem and presents
to hezekiah king of judah so that he was magnified in the sight of
all nations from thenceforth
in those days hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed unto
the lord and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign
but hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
unto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath upon
him and upon judah and jerusalem
notwithstanding hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
heart both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the wrath of
the lord came not upon them in the days of hezekiah
and hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour and he made
himself treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stones
and for spices and for shields and for all manner of pleasant
jewels  storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and
oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and cotes for flocks
moreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks and
herds in abundance for god had given him substance very much
this same hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of gihon
and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of david
and hezekiah prospered in all his works
howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
babylon who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in
the land god left him to try him that he might know all that was in
his heart
now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his goodness behold
they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
and in the book of the kings of judah and israel
and hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the
chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of david and all judah and the
inhabitants of jerusalem did him honour at his death and manasseh his
son reigned in his stead
manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he
reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem  but did that which was
evil in the sight of the lord like unto the abominations of the
heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel
for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had
broken down and he reared up altars for baalim and made groves and
worshipped all the host of heaven and served them
also he built altars in the house of the lord whereof the lord
had said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever
and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts
of the house of the lord
and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley
of the son of hinnom also he observed times and used enchantments
and used witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with
wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him
to anger
and he set a carved image the idol which he had made in the
house of god of which god had said to david and to solomon his son
in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen before all the
tribes of israel will i put my name for ever  neither will i any
more remove the foot of israel from out of the land which i have
appointed for your fathers so that they will take heed to do all that
i have commanded them according to the whole law and the statutes and
the ordinances by the hand of moses
so manasseh made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to err
and to do worse than the heathen whom the lord had destroyed before
the children of israel
and the lord spake to manasseh and to his people but they
would not hearken
wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host of
the king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorns and bound
him with fetters and carried him to babylon
and when he was in affliction he besought the lord his god and
humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers  and
prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his
supplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom
then manasseh knew that the lord he was god
now after this he built a wall without the city of david on the
west side of gihon in the valley even to the entering in at the fish
gate and compassed about ophel and raised it up a very great height
and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of judah
and he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house
of the lord and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the
house of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city
and he repaired the altar of the lord and sacrificed thereon
peace offerings and thank offerings and commanded judah to serve the
lord god of israel
nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places
yet unto the lord their god only
now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer unto his
god and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the
lord god of israel behold they are written in the book of the kings
of israel
his prayer also and how god was intreated of him and all his
sins and his trespass and the places wherein he built high places
and set up groves and graven images before he was humbled behold
they are written among the sayings of the seers
so manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his
own house and amon his son reigned in his stead
amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign and
reigned two years in jerusalem
but he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did
manasseh his father for amon sacrificed unto all the carved images
which manasseh his father had made and served them  and humbled
not himself before the lord as manasseh his father had humbled
himself but amon trespassed more and more
and his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own
house
but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king
in his stead
josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned
in jerusalem one and thirty years
and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and
walked in the ways of david his father and declined neither to the
right hand nor to the left
for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he
began to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth
year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places and
the groves and the carved images and the molten images
and they brake down the altars of baalim in his presence and the
images that were on high above them he cut down and the groves and
the carved images and the molten images he brake in pieces and made
dust of them and strowed it upon the graves of them that had
sacrificed unto them
and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and
cleansed judah and jerusalem
and so did he in the cities of manasseh and ephraim and simeon
even unto naphtali with their mattocks round about
and when he had broken down the altars and the groves and had
beaten the graven images into powder and cut down all the idols
throughout all the land of israel he returned to jerusalem
now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the
land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah
the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to
repair the house of the lord his god
and when they came to hilkiah the high priest they delivered the
money that was brought into the house of god which the levites that
kept the doors had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and
of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and they
returned to jerusalem
and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
oversight of the house of the lord and they gave it to the workmen
that wrought in the house of the lord to repair and amend the house
even to the artificers and builders gave they it to buy hewn
stone and timber for couplings and to floor the houses which the
kings of judah had destroyed
and the men did the work faithfully and the overseers of them
were jahath and obadiah the levites of the sons of merari and
zechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites to set it
forward and other of the levites all that could skill of instruments
of musick
also they were over the bearers of burdens and were overseers
of all that wrought the work in any manner of service and of the
levites there were scribes and officers and porters
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the
house of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the
lord given by moses
and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe i have
found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah
delivered the book to shaphan
and shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king
word back again saying all that was committed to thy servants they
do it
and they have gathered together the money that was found in the
house of the lord and have delivered it into the hand of the
overseers and to the hand of the workmen
then shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the
priest hath given me a book and shaphan read it before the king
and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the
law that he rent his clothes
and the king commanded hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan
and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah a
servant of the kings saying  go enquire of the lord for me
and for them that are left in israel and in judah concerning the
words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord
that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word
of the lord to do after all that is written in this book
and hilkiah and they that the king had appointed went to
huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvath the son
of hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the
college and they spake to her to that effect
and she answered them thus saith the lord god of israel tell
ye the man that sent you to me  thus saith the lord behold i
will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof
even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read
before the king of judah  because they have forsaken me and
have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to
anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be
poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched
and as for the king of judah who sent you to enquire of the
lord so shall ye say unto him thus saith the lord god of israel
concerning the words which thou hast heard  because thine heart
was tender and thou didst humble thyself before god when thou
heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants
thereof and humbledst thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes
and weep before me i have even heard thee also saith the lord
behold i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be
gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the
evil that i will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of
the same so they brought the king word again
then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judah
and jerusalem
and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men
of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and the priests and the
levites and all the people great and small and he read in their
ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the
house of the lord
and the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the
lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his
testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his
soul to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this
book
and he caused all that were present in jerusalem and benjamin to
stand to it and the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to the
covenant of god the god of their fathers
and josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
countries that pertained to the children of israel and made all that
were present in israel to serve even to serve the lord their god and
all his days they departed not from following the lord the god of
their fathers
moreover josiah kept a passover unto the lord in jerusalem and
they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month
and he set the priests in their charges and encouraged them to
the service of the house of the lord  and said unto the levites
that taught all israel which were holy unto the lord put the holy
ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel did
build it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders serve now the
lord your god and his people israel  and prepare yourselves by
the houses of your fathers after your courses according to the
writing of david king of israel and according to the writing of
solomon his son
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
families of the fathers of your brethren the people and after the
division of the families of the levites
so kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare your
brethren that they may do according to the word of the lord by the
hand of moses
and josiah gave to the people of the flock lambs and kids all
for the passover offerings for all that were present to the number
of thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of the
kings substance
and his princes gave willingly unto the people to the priests
and to the levites hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel rulers of the
house of god gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two
thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen
conaniah also and shemaiah and nethaneel his brethren and
hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad chief of the levites gave unto the
levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five
hundred oxen
so the service was prepared and the priests stood in their
place and the levites in their courses according to the kings
commandment
and they killed the passover and the priests sprinkled the
blood from their hands and the levites flayed them
and they removed the burnt offerings that they might give
according to the divisions of the families of the people to offer
unto the lord as it is written in the book of moses and so did they
with the oxen
and they roasted the passover with fire according to the
ordinance but the other holy offerings sod they in pots and in
caldrons and in pans and divided them speedily among all the people
and afterward they made ready for themselves and for the
priests because the priests the sons of aaron were busied in offering
of burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the levites
prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron
and the singers the sons of asaph were in their place according
to the commandment of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the
kings seer and the porters waited at every gate they might not
depart from their service for their brethren the levites prepared for
them
so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day to
keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the
lord according to the commandment of king josiah
and the children of israel that were present kept the passover
at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days
and there was no passover like to that kept in israel from the
days of samuel the prophet neither did all the kings of israel keep
such a passover as josiah kept and the priests and the levites and
all judah and israel that were present and the inhabitants of
jerusalem
in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover
kept
after all this when josiah had prepared the temple necho king
of egypt came up to fight against charchemish by euphrates and josiah
went out against him
but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with
thee thou king of judah i come not against thee this day but
against the house wherewith i have war for god commanded me to make
haste forbear thee from meddling with god who is with me that he
destroy thee not
nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him but
disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not
unto the words of necho from the mouth of god and came to fight in
the valley of megiddo
and the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to his
servants have me away for i am sore wounded
his servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him
in the second chariot that he had and they brought him to jerusalem
and he died and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers
and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah
and jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singing men and
the singing women spake of josiah in their lamentations to this day
and made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written in
the lamentations
now the rest of the acts of josiah and his goodness according
to that which was written in the law of the lord  and his deeds
first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of
israel and judah
then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and
made him king in his fathers stead in jerusalem
jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign
and he reigned three months in jerusalem
and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemned
the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold
and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah
and jerusalem and turned his name to jehoiakim and necho took
jehoahaz his brother and carried him to egypt
jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign
and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was
evil in the sight of the lord his god
against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him
in fetters to carry him to babylon
nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the
lord to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon
now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and his abominations which
he did and that which was found in him behold they are written in
the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son
reigned in his stead
jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he
reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did that which
was evil in the sight of the lord
and when the year was expired king nebuchadnezzar sent and
brought him to babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of the
lord and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem
zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign
and reigned eleven years in jerusalem
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god
and humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the
mouth of the lord
and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had made
him swear by god but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart
from turning unto the lord god of israel
moreover all the chief of the priests and the people
transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen and
polluted the house of the lord which he had hallowed in jerusalem
and the lord god of their fathers sent to them by his
messengers rising up betimes and sending because he had compassion
on his people and on his dwelling place  but they mocked the
messengers of god and despised his words and misused his prophets
until the wrath of the lord arose against his people till there was
no remedy
therefore he brought upon them the king of the chaldees who
slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary
and had no compassion upon young man or maiden old man or him that
stooped for age he gave them all into his hand
and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and
the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king
and of his princes all these he brought to babylon
and they burnt the house of god and brake down the wall of
jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed
all the goodly vessels thereof
and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign
of the kingdom of persia  to fulfil the word of the lord by the
mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths for as
long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and
ten years
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of
the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished the
lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a
proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing
saying  thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the
earth hath the lord god of heaven given me and he hath charged me to
build him an house in jerusalem which is in judah who is there among
you of all his people  the lord his god be with him and let him go up
ezra
now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of
the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred
up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation
throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying
thus saith cyrus king of persia the lord god of heaven hath given me
all the kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me to build him an
house at jerusalem which is in judah
who is there among you of all his people his god be with him and
let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and build the house of
the lord god of israel he is the god which is in jerusalem
and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth let the
men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods
and with beasts beside the freewill offering for the house of god
that is in jerusalem
then rose up the chief of the fathers of judah and benjamin and
the priests and the levites with all them whose spirit god had
raised to go up to build the house of the lord which is in jerusalem
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with
vessels of silver with gold with goods and with beasts and with
precious things beside all that was willingly offered
also cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the
lord which nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of jerusalem and had
put them in the house of his gods  even those did cyrus king of
persia bring forth by the hand of mithredath the treasurer and
numbered them unto sheshbazzar the prince of judah
and this is the number of them thirty chargers of gold a
thousand chargers of silver nine and twenty knives  thirty
basons of gold silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten
and other vessels a thousand
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four
hundred all these did sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity
that were brought up from babylon unto jerusalem
now these are the children of the province that went up out of the
captivity of those which had been carried away whom nebuchadnezzar
the king of babylon had carried away unto babylon and came again unto
jerusalem and judah every one unto his city  which came with

all the nethinims and the children of solomons servants were

and these were they which went up from telmelah telharsa
cherub addan and immer but they could not shew their fathers
house and their seed whether they were of israel  the children
of delaiah the children of tobiah the children of nekoda six
hundred fifty and two
and of the children of the priests the children of habaiah the
children of koz the children of barzillai which took a wife of the
daughters of barzillai the gileadite and was called after their name
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by
genealogy but they were not found therefore were they as polluted
put from the priesthood
and the tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the
most holy things till there stood up a priest with urim and with
thummim
the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three
hundred and threescore  beside their servants and their maids of
whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and
there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women
their horses were seven hundred thirty and six their mules two
hundred forty and five  their camels four hundred thirty and
five their asses six thousand seven hundred and twenty
and some of the chief of the fathers when they came to the house
of the lord which is at jerusalem offered freely for the house of god
to set it up in his place  they gave after their ability unto the
treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold and
five thousand pound of silver and one hundred priests garments
so the priests and the levites and some of the people and the
singers and the porters and the nethinims dwelt in their cities
and all israel in their cities
and when the seventh month was come and the children of israel
were in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one man
to jerusalem
then stood up jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren the
priests and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and his brethren and
builded the altar of the god of israel to offer burnt offerings
thereon as it is written in the law of moses the man of god
and they set the altar upon his bases for fear was upon them
because of the people of those countries and they offered burnt
offerings thereon unto the lord even burnt offerings morning and
evening
they kept also the feast of tabernacles as it is written and
offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the custom
as the duty of every day required  and afterward offered the
continual burnt offering both of the new moons and of all the set
feasts of the lord that were consecrated and of every one that
willingly offered a freewill offering unto the lord
from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt
offerings unto the lord but the foundation of the temple of the lord
was not yet laid
they gave money also unto the masons and to the carpenters and
meat and drink and oil unto them of zidon and to them of tyre to
bring cedar trees from lebanon to the sea of joppa according to the
grant that they had of cyrus king of persia
now in the second year of their coming unto the house of god at
jerusalem in the second month began zerubbabel the son of shealtiel
and jeshua the son of jozadak and the remnant of their brethren the
priests and the levites and all they that were come out of the
captivity unto jerusalem and appointed the levites from twenty years
old and upward to set forward the work of the house of the lord
then stood jeshua with his sons and his brethren kadmiel and his
sons the sons of judah together to set forward the workmen in the
house of god the sons of henadad with their sons and their brethren
the levites
and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the
lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the
levites the sons of asaph with cymbals to praise the lord after the
ordinance of david king of israel
and they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks
unto the lord because he is good for his mercy endureth for ever
toward israel
and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the
lord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid
but many of the priests and levites and chief of the fathers who
were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation
of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and
many shouted aloud for joy  so that the people could not discern
the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the
people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was
heard afar off
now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the
children of the captivity builded the temple unto the lord god of
israel  then they came to zerubbabel and to the chief of the
fathers and said unto them let us build with you for we seek your
god as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of
esarhaddon king of assur which brought us up hither
but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the chief of the
fathers of israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us to
build an house unto our god but we ourselves together will build unto
the lord god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia hath
commanded us
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of
judah and troubled them in building  and hired counsellors
against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of cyrus king
of persia even until the reign of darius king of persia
and in the reign of ahasuerus in the beginning of his reign
wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and
jerusalem
and in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam mithredath tabeel
and the rest of their companions unto artaxerxes king of persia and
the writing of the letter was written in the syrian tongue and
interpreted in the syrian tongue
rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter
against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort  then wrote
rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe and the rest of their
companions the dinaites the apharsathchites the tarpelites the
apharsites the archevites the babylonians the susanchites the
dehavites and the elamites  and the rest of the nations whom the
great and noble asnapper brought over and set in the cities of
samaria and the rest that are on this side the river and at such a
time
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him even unto
artaxerxes the king thy servants the men on this side the river and
at such a time
be it known unto the king that the jews which came up from thee
to us are come unto jerusalem building the rebellious and the bad
city and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations
be it known now unto the king that if this city be builded and
the walls set up again then will they not pay toll tribute and
custom and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings
now because we have maintenance from the kings palace and it
was not meet for us to see the kings dishonour therefore have we
sent and certified the king  that search may be made in the book
of the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the book of the
records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful
unto kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the
same of old time for which cause was this city destroyed
we certify the king that if this city be builded again and the
walls thereof set up by this means thou shalt have no portion on this
side the river
then sent the king an answer unto rehum the chancellor and to
shimshai the scribe and to the rest of their companions that dwell in
samaria and unto the rest beyond the river peace and at such a
time
the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before
me
and i commanded and search hath been made and it is found that
this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings and that
rebellion and sedition have been made therein
there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem which have
ruled over all countries beyond the river and toll tribute and
custom was paid unto them
give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease and that
this city be not builded until another commandment shall be given
from me
take heed now that ye fail not to do this why should damage grow
to the hurt of the kings   now when the copy of king artaxerxes
letter was read before rehum and shimshai the scribe and their
companions they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews and made
them to cease by force and power
then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem
so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of darius king of
persia
then the prophets haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of
iddo prophesied unto the jews that were in judah and jerusalem in the
name of the god of israel even unto them
then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son
of jozadak and began to build the house of god which is at jerusalem
and with them were the prophets of god helping them
at the same time came to them tatnai governor on this side the
river and shetharboznai and their companions and said thus unto
them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this
wall   then said we unto them after this manner what are the
names of the men that make this building   but the eye of their
god was upon the elders of the jews that they could not cause them to
cease till the matter came to darius and then they returned answer
by letter concerning this matter
the copy of the letter that tatnai governor on this side the
river and shetharboznai and his companions the apharsachites which
were on this side the river sent unto darius the king  they sent
a letter unto him wherein was written thus unto darius the king all
peace
be it known unto the king that we went into the province of
judea to the house of the great god which is builded with great
stones and timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth fast on
and prospereth in their hands
then asked we those elders and said unto them thus who commanded
you to build this house and to make up these walls   we asked
their names also to certify thee that we might write the names of
the men that were the chief of them
and thus they returned us answer saying we are the servants of
the god of heaven and earth and build the house that was builded
these many years ago which a great king of israel builded and set up
but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven unto
wrath he gave them into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of
babylon the chaldean who destroyed this house and carried the
people away into babylon
but in the first year of cyrus the king of babylon the same king
cyrus made a decree to build this house of god
and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of god
which nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in jerusalem and
brought them into the temple of babylon those did cyrus the king take
out of the temple of babylon and they were delivered unto one whose
name was sheshbazzar whom he had made governor  and said unto
him take these vessels go carry them into the temple that is in
jerusalem and let the house of god be builded in his place
then came the same sheshbazzar and laid the foundation of the
house of god which is in jerusalem and since that time even until now
hath it been in building and yet it is not finished
now therefore if it seem good to the king let there be search
made in the kings treasure house which is there at babylon whether
it be so that a decree was made of cyrus the king to build this house
of god at jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us
concerning this matter
then darius the king made a decree and search was made in the
house of the rolls where the treasures were laid up in babylon
and there was found at achmetha in the palace that is in the
province of the medes a roll and therein was a record thus written
in the first year of cyrus the king the same cyrus the king made a
decree concerning the house of god at jerusalem let the house be
builded the place where they offered sacrifices and let the
foundations thereof be strongly laid the height thereof threescore
cubits and the breadth thereof threescore cubits  with three rows
of great stones and a row of new timber and let the expenses be
given out of the kings house  and also let the golden and silver
vessels of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took forth out of
the temple which is at jerusalem and brought unto babylon be
restored and brought again unto the temple which is at jerusalem
every one to his place and place them in the house of god
now therefore tatnai governor beyond the river shetharboznai
and your companions the apharsachites which are beyond the river be
ye far from thence  let the work of this house of god alone let
the governor of the jews and the elders of the jews build this house
of god in his place
moreover i make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these
jews for the building of this house of god that of the kings goods
even of the tribute beyond the river forthwith expenses be given unto
these men that they be not hindered
and that which they have need of both young bullocks and rams
and lambs for the burnt offerings of the god of heaven wheat salt
wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which are
at jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail  that
they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the god of heaven and
pray for the life of the king and of his sons
also i have made a decree that whosoever shall alter this word
let timber be pulled down from his house and being set up let him be
hanged thereon and let his house be made a dunghill for this
and the god that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all
kings and people that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy
this house of god which is at jerusalem i darius have made a decree
let it be done with speed
then tatnai governor on this side the river shetharboznai and
their companions according to that which darius the king had sent so
they did speedily
and the elders of the jews builded and they prospered through
the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo
and they builded and finished it according to the commandment of the
god of israel and according to the commandment of cyrus and darius
and artaxerxes king of persia
and this house was finished on the third day of the month adar
which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king
and the children of israel the priests and the levites and the
rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of this
house of god with joy
and offered at the dedication of this house of god an hundred
bullocks two hundred rams four hundred lambs and for a sin offering
for all israel twelve he goats according to the number of the tribes
of israel
and they set the priests in their divisions and the levites in
their courses for the service of god which is at jerusalem as it is
written in the book of moses
and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
fourteenth day of the first month
for the priests and the levites were purified together all of
them were pure and killed the passover for all the children of the
captivity and for their brethren the priests and for themselves
and the children of israel which were come again out of
captivity and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the
filthiness of the heathen of the land to seek the lord god of israel
did eat  and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with
joy for the lord had made them joyful and turned the heart of the
king of assyria unto them to strengthen their hands in the work of
the house of god the god of israel
now after these things in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia
ezra the son of seraiah the son of azariah the son of hilkiah
the son of shallum the son of zadok the son of ahitub  the son
of amariah the son of azariah the son of meraioth  the son of
zerahiah the son of uzzi the son of bukki  the son of abishua
the son of phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the chief
priest  this ezra went up from babylon and he was a ready scribe
in the law of moses which the lord god of israel had given and the
king granted him all his request according to the hand of the lord
his god upon him
and there went up some of the children of israel and of the
priests and the levites and the singers and the porters and the
nethinims unto jerusalem in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king
and he came to jerusalem in the fifth month which was in the
seventh year of the king
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from
babylon and on the first day of the fifth month came he to jerusalem
according to the good hand of his god upon him
for ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the lord and
to do it and to teach in israel statutes and judgments
now this is the copy of the letter that the king artaxerxes gave
unto ezra the priest the scribe even a scribe of the words of the
commandments of the lord and of his statutes to israel
artaxerxes king of kings unto ezra the priest a scribe of the
law of the god of heaven perfect peace and at such a time
i make a decree that all they of the people of israel and of
his priests and levites in my realm which are minded of their own
freewill to go up to jerusalem go with thee
forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and of his seven
counsellors to enquire concerning judah and jerusalem according to
the law of thy god which is in thine hand  and to carry the
silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have freely
offered unto the god of israel whose habitation is in jerusalem
and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province
of babylon with the freewill offering of the people and of the
priests offering willingly for the house of their god which is in
jerusalem  that thou mayest buy speedily with this money
bullocks rams lambs with their meat offerings and their drink
offerings and offer them upon the altar of the house of your god
which is in jerusalem
and whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to
do with the rest of the silver and the gold that do after the will of
your god
the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house
of thy god those deliver thou before the god of jerusalem
and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy god
which thou shalt have occasion to bestow bestow it out of the kings
treasure house
and i even i artaxerxes the king do make a decree to all the
treasurers which are beyond the river that whatsoever ezra the
priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven shall require of
you it be done speedily  unto an hundred talents of silver and
to an hundred measures of wheat and to an hundred baths of wine and
to an hundred baths of oil and salt without prescribing how much
whatsoever is commanded by the god of heaven let it be
diligently done for the house of the god of heaven for why should
there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons   also
we certify you that touching any of the priests and levites singers
porters nethinims or ministers of this house of god it shall not be
lawful to impose toll tribute or custom upon them
and thou ezra after the wisdom of thy god that is in thine
hand set magistrates and judges which may judge all the people that
are beyond the river all such as know the laws of thy god and teach
ye them that know them not
and whosoever will not do the law of thy god and the law of the
king let judgment be executed speedily upon him whether it be unto
death or to banishment or to confiscation of goods or to
imprisonment
blessed be the lord god of our fathers which hath put such a
thing as this in the kings heart to beautify the house of the lord
which is in jerusalem  and hath extended mercy unto me before the
king and his counsellors and before all the kings mighty princes
and i was strengthened as the hand of the lord my god was upon me and
i gathered together out of israel chief men to go up with me
these are now the chief of their fathers and this is the
genealogy of them that went up with me from babylon in the reign of
artaxerxes the king
of the sons of phinehas gershom of the sons of ithamar daniel
of the sons of david hattush
of the sons of shechaniah of the sons of pharosh zechariah and
with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty
of the sons of pahathmoab elihoenai the son of zerahiah and with
him two hundred males
of the sons of shechaniah the son of jahaziel and with him three
hundred males
of the sons also of adin ebed the son of jonathan and with him
fifty males
and of the sons of elam jeshaiah the son of athaliah and with
him seventy males
and of the sons of shephatiah zebadiah the son of michael and
with him fourscore males
of the sons of joab obadiah the son of jehiel and with him two
hundred and eighteen males
and of the sons of shelomith the son of josiphiah and with him
an hundred and threescore males
and of the sons of bebai zechariah the son of bebai and with
him twenty and eight males
and of the sons of azgad johanan the son of hakkatan and with
him an hundred and ten males
and of the last sons of adonikam whose names are these
eliphelet jeiel and shemaiah and with them threescore males
of the sons also of bigvai uthai and zabbud and with them
seventy males
and i gathered them together to the river that runneth to ahava
and there abode we in tents three days and i viewed the people and
the priests and found there none of the sons of levi
then sent i for eliezer for ariel for shemaiah and for
elnathan and for jarib and for elnathan and for nathan and for
zechariah and for meshullam chief men also for joiarib and for
elnathan men of understanding
and i sent them with commandment unto iddo the chief at the place
casiphia and i told them what they should say unto iddo and to his
brethren the nethinims at the place casiphia that they should bring
unto us ministers for the house of our god
and by the good hand of our god upon us they brought us a man of
understanding of the sons of mahli the son of levi the son of
israel and sherebiah with his sons and his brethren eighteen
and hashabiah and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari his
brethren and their sons twenty  also of the nethinims whom
david and the princes had appointed for the service of the levites
two hundred and twenty nethinims all of them were expressed by name
then i proclaimed a fast there at the river of ahava that we
might afflict ourselves before our god to seek of him a right way for
us and for our little ones and for all our substance
for i was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and
horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had
spoken unto the king saying the hand of our god is upon all them for
good that seek him but his power and his wrath is against all them
that forsake him
so we fasted and besought our god for this and he was intreated
of us
then i separated twelve of the chief of the priests sherebiah
hashabiah and ten of their brethren with them  and weighed unto
them the silver and the gold and the vessels even the offering of
the house of our god which the king and his counsellors and his
lords and all israel there present had offered  i even weighed
unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver
vessels an hundred talents and of gold an hundred talents  also
twenty basons of gold of a thousand drams and two vessels of fine
copper precious as gold
and i said unto them ye are holy unto the lord the vessels are
holy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto
the lord god of your fathers
watch ye and keep them until ye weigh them before the chief of
the priests and the levites and chief of the fathers of israel at
jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the lord
so took the priests and the levites the weight of the silver and
the gold and the vessels to bring them to jerusalem unto the house
of our god
then we departed from the river of ahava on the twelfth day of
the first month to go unto jerusalem and the hand of our god was
upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such
as lay in wait by the way
and we came to jerusalem and abode there three days
now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels
weighed in the house of our god by the hand of meremoth the son of
uriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas and
with them was jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of
binnui levites  by number and by weight of every one and all
the weight was written at that time
also the children of those that had been carried away which were
come out of the captivity offered burnt offerings unto the god of
israel twelve bullocks for all israel ninety and six rams seventy
and seven lambs twelve he goats for a sin offering all this was a
burnt offering unto the lord
and they delivered the kings commissions unto the kings
lieutenants and to the governors on this side the river and they
furthered the people and the house of god
now when these things were done the princes came to me saying
the people of israel and the priests and the levites have not
separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to
their abominations even of the canaanites the hittites the
perizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptians
and the amorites
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for
their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the
people of those lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers hath
been chief in this trespass
and when i heard this thing i rent my garment and my mantle and
plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down
astonied
then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words
of the god of israel because of the transgression of those that had
been carried away and i sat astonied until the evening sacrifice
and at the evening sacrifice i arose up from my heaviness and
having rent my garment and my mantle i fell upon my knees and spread
out my hands unto the lord my god  and said o my god i am
ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for our
iniquities are increased over our head and our trespass is grown up
unto the heavens
since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass
unto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and our
priests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to
the sword to captivity and to a spoil and to confusion of face as
it is this day
and now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the lord
our god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his
holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little
reviving in our bondage
for we were bondmen yet our god hath not forsaken us in our
bondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of
persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god and to
repair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in judah and in
jerusalem
and now o our god what shall we say after this for we have
forsaken thy commandments  which thou hast commanded by thy
servants the prophets saying the land unto which ye go to possess
it is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands
with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another
with their uncleanness
now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons neither
take their daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their
wealth for ever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land
and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever
and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for
our great trespass seeing that thou our god hast punished us less
than our iniquities deserve and hast given us such deliverance as
this  should we again break thy commandments and join in
affinity with the people of these abominations wouldest not thou be
angry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be no
remnant nor escaping   o lord god of israel thou art righteous
for we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are before
thee in our trespasses for we cannot stand before thee because of
this
now when ezra had prayed and when he had confessed weeping and
casting himself down before the house of god there assembled unto him
out of israel a very great congregation of men and women and children
for the people wept very sore
and shechaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam
answered and said unto ezra we have trespassed against our god and
have taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there is
hope in israel concerning this thing
now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all
the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of
my lord and of those that tremble at the commandment of our god and
let it be done according to the law
arise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be with
thee be of good courage and do it
then arose ezra and made the chief priests the levites and all
israel to swear that they should do according to this word and they
sware
then ezra rose up from before the house of god and went into the
chamber of johanan the son of eliashib and when he came thither he
did eat no bread nor drink water for he mourned because of the
transgression of them that had been carried away
and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto
all the children of the captivity that they should gather themselves
together unto jerusalem  and that whosoever would not come within
three days according to the counsel of the princes and the elders
all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the
congregation of those that had been carried away
then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves
together unto jerusalem within three days it was the ninth month on
the twentieth day of the month and all the people sat in the street
of the house of god trembling because of this matter and for the
great rain
and ezra the priest stood up and said unto them ye have
transgressed and have taken strange wives to increase the trespass
of israel
now therefore make confession unto the lord god of your fathers
and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the people of the
land and from the strange wives
then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice
as thou hast said so must we do
but the people are many and it is a time of much rain and we
are not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day or
two for we are many that have transgressed in this thing
let now our rulers of all the congregation stand and let all
them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed
times and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereof
until the fierce wrath of our god for this matter be turned from us
only jonathan the son of asahel and jahaziah the son of tikvah
were employed about this matter and meshullam and shabbethai the
levite helped them

taken strange wives namely of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak

the book of nehemiah
the words of nehemiah the son of hachaliah and it came to pass
in the month chisleu in the twentieth year as i was in shushan the
palace  that hanani one of my brethren came he and certain men
of judah and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped which
were left of the captivity and concerning jerusalem
and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the captivity
there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall
of jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned
with fire
and it came to pass when i heard these words that i sat down and
wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god
of heaven  and said i beseech thee o lord god of heaven the
great and terrible god that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that
love him and observe his commandments  let thine ear now be
attentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of
thy servant which i pray before thee now day and night for the
children of israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children
of israel which we have sinned against thee both i and my fathers
house have sinned
we have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the
commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which thou
commandedst thy servant moses
remember i beseech thee the word that thou commandedst thy
servant moses saying if ye transgress i will scatter you abroad
among the nations  but if ye turn unto me and keep my
commandments and do them though there were of you cast out unto the
uttermost part of the heaven yet will i gather them from thence and
will bring them unto the place that i have chosen to set my name
there
now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hast
redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand
o lord i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the
prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire
to fear thy name and prosper i pray thee thy servant this day and
grant him mercy in the sight of this man for i was the kings
cupbearer
and it came to pass in the month nisan in the twentieth year of
artaxerxes the king that wine was before him and i took up the wine
and gave it unto the king now i had not been beforetime sad in his
presence
wherefore the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad
seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart
then i was very sore afraid  and said unto the king let the king
live for ever why should not my countenance be sad when the city
the place of my fathers sepulchres lieth waste and the gates
thereof are consumed with fire   then the king said unto me for
what dost thou make request so i prayed to the god of heaven
and i said unto the king if it please the king and if thy
servant have found favour in thy sight that thou wouldest send me
unto judah unto the city of my fathers sepulchres that i may build
it
and the king said unto me the queen also sitting by him for
how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return so it
pleased the king to send me and i set him a time
moreover i said unto the king if it please the king let letters
be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me
over till i come into judah  and a letter unto asaph the keeper of
the kings forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the
gates of the palace which appertained to the house and for the wall
of the city and for the house that i shall enter into and the king
granted me according to the good hand of my god upon me
then i came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the
kings letters now the king had sent captains of the army and
horsemen with me
when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the
ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come
a man to seek the welfare of the children of israel
so i came to jerusalem and was there three days
and i arose in the night i and some few men with me neither
told i any man what my god had put in my heart to do at jerusalem
neither was there any beast with me save the beast that i rode upon
and i went out by night by the gate of the valley even before
the dragon well and to the dung port and viewed the walls of
jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed
with fire
then i went on to the gate of the fountain and to the kings
pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass
then went i up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall
and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so
returned
and the rulers knew not whither i went or what i did neither
had i as yet told it to the jews nor to the priests nor to the
nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work
then said i unto them ye see the distress that we are in how
jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire
come and let us build up the wall of jerusalem that we be no more a
reproach
then i told them of the hand of my god which was good upon me as
also the kings words that he had spoken unto me and they said let
us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good
work
but when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the
ammonite and geshem the arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn
and despised us and said what is this thing that ye do will ye
rebel against the king   then answered i them and said unto
them the god of heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants
will arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor memorial
in jerusalem

priests and they builded the sheep gate they sanctified it and set
up the doors of it even unto the tower of meah they sanctified it
unto the tower of hananeel

and between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate
repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants
but it came to pass that when sanballat heard that we builded the
wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the jews
and he spake before his brethren and the army of samaria and
said what do these feeble jews will they fortify themselves will
they sacrifice  will they make an end in a day will they revive the
stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned   now
tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they
build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall
hear o our god for we are despised and turn their reproach upon
their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity
and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out
from before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before the
builders
so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together unto
the half thereof for the people had a mind to work
but it came to pass that when sanballat and tobiah and the
arabians and the ammonites and the ashdodites heard that the walls
of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped
then they were very wroth  and conspired all of them together to
come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it
nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god and set a watch
against them day and night because of them
and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is
decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build
the wall
and our adversaries said they shall not know neither see till
we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to
cease
and it came to pass that when the jews which dwelt by them came
they said unto us ten times from all places whence ye shall return
unto us they will be upon you
therefore set i in the lower places behind the wall and on the
higher places i even set the people after their families with their
swords their spears and their bows
and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the
rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them
remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your
brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses
and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known
unto us and god had brought their counsel to nought that we returned
all of us to the wall every one unto his work
and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my
servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the
spears the shields and the bows and the habergeons and the rulers
were behind all the house of judah
they which builded on the wall and they that bare burdens with
those that laded every one with one of his hands wrought in the work
and with the other hand held a weapon
for the builders every one had his sword girded by his side and
so builded and he that sounded the trumpet was by me
and i said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of
the people the work is great and large and we are separated upon the
wall one far from another
in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet resort
ye thither unto us our god shall fight for us
so we laboured in the work and half of them held the spears from
the rising of the morning till the stars appeared
likewise at the same time said i unto the people let every one
with his servant lodge within jerusalem that in the night they may be
a guard to us and labour on the day
so neither i nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of
the guard which followed me none of us put off our clothes saving
that every one put them off for washing
and there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against
their brethren the jews
for there were that said we our sons and our daughters are
many therefore we take up corn for them that we may eat and live
some also there were that said we have mortgaged our lands
vineyards and houses that we might buy corn because of the dearth
there were also that said we have borrowed money for the kings
tribute and that upon our lands and vineyards
yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children as
their children and lo we bring into bondage our sons and our
daughters to be servants and some of our daughters are brought unto
bondage already neither is it in our power to redeem them for other
men have our lands and vineyards
and i was very angry when i heard their cry and these words
then i consulted with myself and i rebuked the nobles and the
rulers and said unto them ye exact usury every one of his brother
and i set a great assembly against them
and i said unto them we after our ability have redeemed our
brethren the jews which were sold unto the heathen and will ye even
sell your brethren or shall they be sold unto us then held they
their peace and found nothing to answer
also i said it is not good that ye do ought ye not to walk in
the fear of our god because of the reproach of the heathen our
enemies   i likewise and my brethren and my servants might
exact of them money and corn i pray you let us leave off this usury
restore i pray you to them even this day their lands their
vineyards their oliveyards and their houses also the hundredth part
of the money and of the corn the wine and the oil that ye exact of
them
then said they we will restore them and will require nothing of
them so will we do as thou sayest then i called the priests and
took an oath of them that they should do according to this promise
also i shook my lap and said so god shake out every man from
his house and from his labour that performeth not this promise even
thus be he shaken out and emptied and all the congregation said
amen and praised the lord and the people did according to this
promise
moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governor
in the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and
thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king that is twelve years i and my
brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor
but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable
unto the people and had taken of them bread and wine beside forty
shekels of silver yea even their servants bare rule over the people
but so did not i because of the fear of god
yea also i continued in the work of this wall neither bought we
any land and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the jews
and rulers beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that
are about us
now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
choice sheep also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten days
store of all sorts of wine yet for all this required not i the bread
of the governor because the bondage was heavy upon this people
think upon me my god for good according to all that i have
done for this people
now it came to pass when sanballat and tobiah and geshem the
arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that i had builded the
wall and that there was no breach left therein though at that time
i had not set up the doors upon the gates  that sanballat and
geshem sent unto me saying come let us meet together in some one of
the villages in the plain of ono but they thought to do me mischief
and i sent messengers unto them saying i am doing a great work
so that i cannot come down why should the work cease whilst i leave
it and come down to you   yet they sent unto me four times after
this sort and i answered them after the same manner
then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth
time with an open letter in his hand  wherein was written it is
reported among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and the
jews think to rebel for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou
mayest be their king according to these words
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
jerusalem saying there is a king in judah and now shall it be
reported to the king according to these words come now therefore and
let us take counsel together
then i sent unto him saying there are no such things done as
thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart
for they all made us afraid saying their hands shall be weakened
from the work that it be not done now therefore o god strengthen
my hands
afterward i came unto the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah
the son of mehetabeel who was shut up and he said let us meet
together in the house of god within the temple and let us shut the
doors of the temple for they will come to slay thee yea in the
night will they come to slay thee
and i said should such a man as i flee and who is there that
being as i am would go into the temple to save his life i will not
go in
and lo i perceived that god had not sent him but that he
pronounced this prophecy against me for tobiah and sanballat had
hired him
therefore was he hired that i should be afraid and do so and
sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they
might reproach me
my god think thou upon tobiah and sanballat according to these
their works and on the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the
prophets that would have put me in fear
so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month
elul in fifty and two days
and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof and
all the heathen that were about us saw these things they were much
cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was
wrought of our god
moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters unto
tobiah and the letters of tobiah came unto them
for there were many in judah sworn unto him because he was the
son in law of shechaniah the son of arah and his son johanan had
taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah
also they reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words
to him and tobiah sent letters to put me in fear
now it came to pass when the wall was built and i had set up the
doors and the porters and the singers and the levites were appointed
that i gave my brother hanani and hananiah the ruler of the
palace charge over jerusalem for he was a faithful man and feared
god above many
and i said unto them let not the gates of jerusalem be opened
until the sun be hot and while they stand by let them shut the
doors and bar them and appoint watches of the inhabitants of
jerusalem every one in his watch and every one to be over against
his house
now the city was large and great but the people were few therein
and the houses were not builded
and my god put into mine heart to gather together the nobles and
the rulers and the people that they might be reckoned by genealogy
and i found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the
first and found written therein  these are the children of the
province that went up out of the captivity of those that had been
carried away whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried
away and came again to jerusalem and to judah every one unto his
city  who came with zerubbabel jeshua nehemiah azariah

children of shephatiah the children of hattil the children of

all the nethinims and the children of solomons servants were
three hundred ninety and two
and these were they which went up also from telmelah telharesha
cherub addon and immer but they could not shew their fathers
house nor their seed whether they were of israel
the children of delaiah the children of tobiah the children of
nekoda six hundred forty and two
and of the priests the children of habaiah the children of koz
the children of barzillai which took one of the daughters of
barzillai the gileadite to wife and was called after their name
these sought their register among those that were reckoned by
genealogy but it was not found therefore were they as polluted put
from the priesthood
and the tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the
most holy things till there stood up a priest with urim and thummim
the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three
hundred and threescore  beside their manservants and their
maidservants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty
and seven and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and
singing women
their horses seven hundred thirty and six their mules two
hundred forty and five  their camels four hundred thirty and
five six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work the
tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold fifty basons
five hundred and thirty priests garments
and some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the
work twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand and two hundred
pound of silver
and that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand
drams of gold and two thousand pound of silver and threescore and
seven priests garments
so the priests and the levites and the porters and the
singers and some of the people and the nethinims and all israel
dwelt in their cities and when the seventh month came the children
of israel were in their cities
and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into
the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto ezra
the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had
commanded to israel
and ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both
of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the
first day of the seventh month
and he read therein before the street that was before the water
gate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and
those that could understand and the ears of all the people were
attentive unto the book of the law
and ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had
made for the purpose and beside him stood mattithiah and shema and
anaiah and urijah and hilkiah and maaseiah on his right hand and
on his left hand pedaiah and mishael and malchiah and hashum and
hashbadana zechariah and meshullam
and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he
was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood
up  and ezra blessed the lord the great god and all the people
answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed
their heads and worshipped the lord with their faces to the ground
also jeshua and bani and sherebiah jamin akkub shabbethai
hodijah maaseiah kelita azariah jozabad hanan pelaiah and the
levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stood
in their place
so they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and gave
the sense and caused them to understand the reading
and nehemiah which is the tirshatha and ezra the priest the
scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto all the
people this day is holy unto the lord your god mourn not nor weep
for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law
then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the
sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for
this day is holy unto our lord neither be ye sorry for the joy of
the lord is your strength
so the levites stilled all the people saying hold your peace
for the day is holy neither be ye grieved
and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to
send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood
the words that were declared unto them
and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the
fathers of all the people the priests and the levites unto ezra the
scribe even to understand the words of the law
and they found written in the law which the lord had commanded by
moses that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast
of the seventh month  and that they should publish and proclaim
in all their cities and in jerusalem saying go forth unto the
mount and fetch olive branches and pine branches and myrtle
branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make
booths as it is written
so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves
booths every one upon the roof of his house and in their courts and
in the courts of the house of god and in the street of the water
gate and in the street of the gate of ephraim
and all the congregation of them that were come again out of the
captivity made booths and sat under the booths for since the days of
jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of israel
done so and there was very great gladness
also day by day from the first day unto the last day he read in
the book of the law of god and they kept the feast seven days and on
the eighth day was a solemn assembly according unto the manner
now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of
israel were assembled with fasting and with sackclothes and earth
upon them
and the seed of israel separated themselves from all strangers
and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their
fathers
and they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law
of the lord their god one fourth part of the day and another fourth
part they confessed and worshipped the lord their god
then stood up upon the stairs of the levites jeshua and bani
kadmiel shebaniah bunni sherebiah bani and chenani and cried
with a loud voice unto the lord their god
then the levites jeshua and kadmiel bani hashabniah
sherebiah hodijah shebaniah and pethahiah said stand up and bless
the lord your god for ever and ever and blessed be thy glorious name
which is exalted above all blessing and praise
thou even thou art lord alone thou hast made heaven the heaven
of heavens with all their host the earth and all things that are
therein the seas and all that is therein and thou preservest them
all and the host of heaven worshippeth thee
thou art the lord the god who didst choose abram and broughtest
him forth out of ur of the chaldees and gavest him the name of
abraham  and foundest his heart faithful before thee and madest a
covenant with him to give the land of the canaanites the hittites
the amorites and the perizzites and the jebusites and the
girgashites to give it i say to his seed and hast performed thy
words for thou art righteous  and didst see the affliction of our
fathers in egypt and heardest their cry by the red sea  and
shewedst signs and wonders upon pharaoh and on all his servants and
on all the people of his land for thou knewest that they dealt
proudly against them so didst thou get thee a name as it is this
day
and thou didst divide the sea before them so that they went
through the midst of the sea on the dry land and their persecutors
thou threwest into the deeps as a stone into the mighty waters
moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar and in
the night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein
they should go
thou camest down also upon mount sinai and spakest with them
from heaven and gavest them right judgments and true laws good
statutes and commandments  and madest known unto them thy holy
sabbath and commandedst them precepts statutes and laws by the
hand of moses thy servant  and gavest them bread from heaven for
their hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for
their thirst and promisedst them that they should go in to possess
the land which thou hadst sworn to give them
but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks
and hearkened not to thy commandments  and refused to obey
neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them but
hardened their necks and in their rebellion appointed a captain to
return to their bondage but thou art a god ready to pardon gracious
and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and forsookest
them not
yea when they had made them a molten calf and said this is thy
god that brought thee up out of egypt and had wrought great
provocations  yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them
not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed not from them
by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by night
to shew them light and the way wherein they should go
thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them and
withheldest not thy manna from their mouth and gavest them water for
their thirst
yea forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness so
that they lacked nothing their clothes waxed not old and their feet
swelled not
moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations and didst divide
them into corners so they possessed the land of sihon and the land
of the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan
their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven and
broughtest them into the land concerning which thou hadst promised to
their fathers that they should go in to possess it
so the children went in and possessed the land and thou
subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land the canaanites and
gavest them into their hands with their kings and the people of the
land that they might do with them as they would
and they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed houses
full of all goods wells digged vineyards and oliveyards and fruit
trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat
and delighted themselves in thy great goodness
nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee
and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which
testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great
provocations
therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies
who vexed them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto
thee thou heardest them from heaven and according to thy manifold
mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of
their enemies
but after they had rest they did evil again before thee
therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies so that they
had the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried unto
thee thou heardest them from heaven and many times didst thou
deliver them according to thy mercies  and testifiedst against
them that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law yet they dealt
proudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned against
thy judgments which if a man do he shall live in them and
withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear
yet many years didst thou forbear them and testifiedst against
them by thy spirit in thy prophets yet would they not give ear
therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands
nevertheless for thy great mercies sake thou didst not utterly
consume them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful
god
now therefore our god the great the mighty and the terrible
god who keepest covenant and mercy let not all the trouble seem
little before thee that hath come upon us on our kings on our
princes and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathers
and on all thy people since the time of the kings of assyria unto
this day
howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us for thou
hast done right but we have done wickedly  neither have our
kings our princes our priests nor our fathers kept thy law nor
hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou
didst testify against them
for they have not served thee in their kingdom and in thy great
goodness that thou gavest them and in the large and fat land which
thou gavest before them neither turned they from their wicked works
behold we are servants this day and for the land that thou
gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof
behold we are servants in it  and it yieldeth much increase unto
the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins also they
have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure
and we are in great distress
and because of all this we make a sure covenant and write it
and our princes levites and priests seal unto it
now those that sealed were nehemiah the tirshatha the son of
hachaliah and zidkijah  seraiah azariah jeremiah  pashur
amariah malchijah  hattush shebaniah malluch  harim
meremoth obadiah  daniel ginnethon baruch  meshullam

and the rest of the people the priests the levites the
porters the singers the nethinims and all they that had separated
themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of god their
wives their sons and their daughters every one having knowledge
and having understanding  they clave to their brethren their
nobles and entered into a curse and into an oath to walk in gods
law which was given by moses the servant of god and to observe and
do all the commandments of the lord our lord and his judgments and
his statutes  and that we would not give our daughters unto the
people of the land not take their daughters for our sons  and
if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath
day to sell that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath or on
the holy day and that we would leave the seventh year and the
exaction of every debt
also we made ordinances for us to charge ourselves yearly with
the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our god
for the shewbread and for the continual meat offering and for
the continual burnt offering of the sabbaths of the new moons for
the set feasts and for the holy things and for the sin offerings to
make an atonement for israel and for all the work of the house of our
god
and we cast the lots among the priests the levites and the
people for the wood offering to bring it into the house of our god
after the houses of our fathers at times appointed year by year to
burn upon the altar of the lord our god as it is written in the law
and to bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits
of all fruit of all trees year by year unto the house of the lord
also the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle as it is
written in the law and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks
to bring to the house of our god unto the priests that minister in
the house of our god  and that we should bring the firstfruits
of our dough and our offerings and the fruit of all manner of trees
of wine and of oil unto the priests to the chambers of the house of
our god and the tithes of our ground unto the levites that the same
levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage
and the priest the son of aaron shall be with the levites when
the levites take tithes and the levites shall bring up the tithe of
the tithes unto the house of our god to the chambers into the
treasure house
for the children of israel and the children of levi shall bring
the offering of the corn of the new wine and the oil unto the
chambers where are the vessels of the sanctuary and the priests that
minister and the porters and the singers and we will not forsake
the house of our god
and the rulers of the people dwelt at jerusalem the rest of the
people also cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in jerusalem the
holy city and nine parts to dwell in other cities
and the people blessed all the men that willingly offered
themselves to dwell at jerusalem

the overseer also of the levites at jerusalem was uzzi the son
of bani the son of hashabiah the son of mattaniah the son of micha

iddo ginnetho abijah  miamin maadiah bilgah  shemaiah

moreover the levites jeshua binnui kadmiel sherebiah judah
and mattaniah which was over the thanksgiving he and his brethren

in the watches
and jeshua begat joiakim joiakim also begat eliashib and
eliashib begat joiada  and joiada begat jonathan and jonathan

and in the days of joiakim were priests the chief of the
fathers of seraiah meraiah of jeremiah hananiah  of ezra

jehonathan  and of joiarib mattenai of jedaiah uzzi  of
sallai kallai of amok eber  of hilkiah hashabiah of
jedaiah nethaneel
the levites in the days of eliashib joiada and johanan and
jaddua were recorded chief of the fathers also the priests to the
reign of darius the persian
the sons of levi the chief of the fathers were written in the
book of the chronicles even until the days of johanan the son of
eliashib
and the chief of the levites hashabiah sherebiah and jeshua
the son of kadmiel with their brethren over against them to praise
and to give thanks according to the commandment of david the man of
god ward over against ward
mattaniah and bakbukiah obadiah meshullam talmon akkub
were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates
these were in the days of joiakim the son of jeshua the son of
jozadak and in the days of nehemiah the governor and of ezra the
priest the scribe
and at the dedication of the wall of jerusalem they sought the
levites out of all their places to bring them to jerusalem to keep
the dedication with gladness both with thanksgivings and with
singing with cymbals psalteries and with harps
and the sons of the singers gathered themselves together both
out of the plain country round about jerusalem and from the villages
of netophathi  also from the house of gilgal and out of the
fields of geba and azmaveth for the singers had builded them villages
round about jerusalem
and the priests and the levites purified themselves and
purified the people and the gates and the wall
then i brought up the princes of judah upon the wall and
appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks whereof one
went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate  and
after them went hoshaiah and half of the princes of judah  and
azariah ezra and meshullam  judah and benjamin and shemaiah
and jeremiah  and certain of the priests sons with trumpets
namely zechariah the son of jonathan the son of shemaiah the son of
mattaniah the son of michaiah the son of zaccur the son of asaph
and his brethren shemaiah and azarael milalai gilalai maai
nethaneel and judah hanani with the musical instruments of david
the man of god and ezra the scribe before them
and at the fountain gate which was over against them they went
up by the stairs of the city of david at the going up of the wall
above the house of david even unto the water gate eastward
and the other company of them that gave thanks went over against
them and i after them and the half of the people upon the wall from
beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall  and
from above the gate of ephraim and above the old gate and above the
fish gate and the tower of hananeel and the tower of meah even unto
the sheep gate and they stood still in the prison gate
so stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house
of god and i and the half of the rulers with me  and the
priests eliakim maaseiah miniamin michaiah elioenai zechariah
and hananiah with trumpets  and maaseiah and shemaiah and
eleazar and uzzi and jehohanan and malchijah and elam and ezer
and the singers sang loud with jezrahiah their overseer
also that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced for
god had made them rejoice with great joy the wives also and the
children rejoiced so that the joy of jerusalem was heard even afar
off
and at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
treasures for the offerings for the firstfruits and for the tithes
to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of
the law for the priests and levites for judah rejoiced for the
priests and for the levites that waited
and both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their god
and the ward of the purification according to the commandment of
david and of solomon his son
for in the days of david and asaph of old there were chief of
the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto god
and all israel in the days of zerubbabel and in the days of
nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters every day
his portion and they sanctified holy things unto the levites and the
levites sanctified them unto the children of aaron
on that day they read in the book of moses in the audience of the
people and therein was found written that the ammonite and the
moabite should not come into the congregation of god for ever
because they met not the children of israel with bread and with water
but hired balaam against them that he should curse them howbeit our
god turned the curse into a blessing
now it came to pass when they had heard the law that they
separated from israel all the mixed multitude
and before this eliashib the priest having the oversight of the
chamber of the house of our god was allied unto tobiah  and he
had prepared for him a great chamber where aforetime they laid the
meat offerings the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of
the corn the new wine and the oil which was commanded to be given
to the levites and the singers and the porters and the offerings of
the priests
but in all this time was not i at jerusalem for in the two and
thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon came i unto the king and
after certain days obtained i leave of the king  and i came to
jerusalem and understood of the evil that eliashib did for tobiah in
preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of god
and it grieved me sore therefore i cast forth all the household
stuff to tobiah out of the chamber
then i commanded and they cleansed the chambers and thither
brought i again the vessels of the house of god with the meat
offering and the frankincense
and i perceived that the portions of the levites had not been
given them for the levites and the singers that did the work were
fled every one to his field
then contended i with the rulers and said why is the house of
god forsaken and i gathered them together and set them in their
place
then brought all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine
and the oil unto the treasuries
and i made treasurers over the treasuries shelemiah the priest
and zadok the scribe and of the levites pedaiah and next to them
was hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah for they were
counted faithful and their office was to distribute unto their
brethren
remember me o my god concerning this and wipe not out my good
deeds that i have done for the house of my god and for the offices
thereof
in those days saw i in judah some treading wine presses on the
sabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses as also wine
grapes and figs and all manner of burdens which they brought into
jerusalem on the sabbath day and i testified against them in the day
wherein they sold victuals
there dwelt men of tyre also therein which brought fish and
all manner of ware and sold on the sabbath unto the children of
judah and in jerusalem
then i contended with the nobles of judah and said unto them
what evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day
did not your fathers thus and did not our god bring all this
evil upon us and upon this city yet ye bring more wrath upon israel
by profaning the sabbath
and it came to pass that when the gates of jerusalem began to
be dark before the sabbath i commanded that the gates should be shut
and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath and
some of my servants set i at the gates that there should no burden be
brought in on the sabbath day
so the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
jerusalem once or twice
then i testified against them and said unto them why lodge ye
about the wall if ye do so again i will lay hands on you from that
time forth came they no more on the sabbath
and i commanded the levites that they should cleanse themselves
and that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbath
day
remember me o my god concerning this also and spare me according to
the greatness of thy mercy
in those days also saw i jews that had married wives of ashdod
of ammon and of moab  and their children spake half in the
speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jews language but
according to the language of each people
and i contended with them and cursed them and smote certain of
them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by god saying
ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their
daughters unto your sons or for yourselves
did not solomon king of israel sin by these things yet among
many nations was there no king like him who was beloved of his god
and god made him king over all israel nevertheless even him did
outlandish women cause to sin
shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil to
transgress against our god in marrying strange wives   and one
of the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the high priest was son in
law to sanballat the horonite therefore i chased him from me
remember them o my god because they have defiled the
priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the levites
thus cleansed i them from all strangers and appointed the wards
of the priests and the levites every one in his business  and
for the wood offering at times appointed and for the firstfruits
remember me o my god for good
the book of esther
now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus this is ahasuerus
which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over an hundred and
seven and twenty provinces  that in those days when the king
ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the
palace  in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all
his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the
nobles and princes of the provinces being before him  when he
shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his
excellent majesty many days even an hundred and fourscore days
and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all
the people that were present in shushan the palace both unto great
and small seven days in the court of the garden of the kings
palace  where were white green and blue hangings fastened with
cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble
the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue
and white and black marble
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being
diverse one from another and royal wine in abundance according to
the state of the king
and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so
the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they
should do according to every mans pleasure
also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
house which belonged to king ahasuerus
on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with
wine he commanded mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha
zethar and carcas the seven chamberlains that served in the presence
of ahasuerus the king  to bring vashti the queen before the king
with the crown royal to shew the people and the princes her beauty
for she was fair to look on
but the queen vashti refused to come at the kings commandment by
his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger
burned in him
then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so
was the kings manner toward all that knew law and judgment  and
the next unto him was carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres
marsena and memucan the seven princes of persia and media which saw
the kings face and which sat the first in the kingdom  what
shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law because she hath
not performed the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the
chamberlains   and memucan answered before the king and the
princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but
also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the
provinces of the king ahasuerus
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so
that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be
reported the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought
in before him but she came not
likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto
all the kings princes which have heard of the deed of the queen
thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath
if it please the king let there go a royal commandment from him
and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes
that it be not altered that vashti come no more before king
ahasuerus and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is
better than she
and when the kings decree which he shall make shall be published
throughout all his empire for it is great all the wives shall give
to their husbands honour both to great and small
and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the king did
according to the word of memucan  for he sent letters into all
the kings provinces into every province according to the writing
thereof and to every people after their language that every man
should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published
according to the language of every people
after these things when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeased
he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed
against her
then said the kings servants that ministered unto him let there
be fair young virgins sought for the king  and let the king
appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may
gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace to
the house of the women unto the custody of hege the kings
chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for
purification be given them  and let the maiden which pleaseth the
king be queen instead of vashti
and the thing pleased the king and he did so
now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name was
mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a
benjamite  who had been carried away from jerusalem with the
captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah
whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away
and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncles daughter
for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and
beautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took
for his own daughter
so it came to pass when the kings commandment and his decree was
heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the
palace to the custody of hegai that esther was brought also unto the
kings house to the custody of hegai keeper of the women
and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and
he speedily gave her her things for purification with such things as
belonged to her and seven maidens which were meet to be given her
out of the kings house and he preferred her and her maids unto the
best place of the house of the women
esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred for mordecai
had charged her that she should not shew it
and mordecai walked every day before the court of the womens
house to know how esther did and what should become of her
now when every maids turn was come to go in to king ahasuerus
after that she had been twelve months according to the manner of the
women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to
wit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odours
and with other things for the purifying of the women  then thus
came every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her
to go with her out of the house of the women unto the kings house
in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the
second house of the women to the custody of shaashgaz the kings
chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no
more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by
name
now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncle of
mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto
the king she required nothing but what hegai the kings chamberlain
the keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favour in the
sight of all them that looked upon her
so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in
the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of his
reign
and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained
grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins so that he
set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of
vashti
then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
servants even esthers feast and he made a release to the provinces
and gave gifts according to the state of the king
and when the virgins were gathered together the second time then
mordecai sat in the kings gate
esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people as mordecai
had charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like as
when she was brought up with him
in those days while mordecai sat in the kings gate two of the
kings chamberlains bigthan and teresh of those which kept the door
were wroth and sought to lay hands on the king ahasuerus
and the thing was known to mordecai who told it unto esther the
queen and esther certified the king thereof in mordecais name
and when inquisition was made of the matter it was found out
therefore they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the
book of the chronicles before the king
after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son of
hammedatha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all
the princes that were with him
and all the kings servants that were in the kings gate bowed
and reverenced haman for the king had so commanded concerning him
but mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence
then the kings servants which were in the kings gate said unto
mordecai why transgressest thou the kings commandment   now it
came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not
unto them that they told haman to see whether mordecais matters
would stand for he had told them that he was a jew
and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence
then was haman full of wrath
and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone for they had
shewed him the people of mordecai wherefore haman sought to destroy
all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus even
the people of mordecai
in the first month that is the month nisan in the twelfth year
of king ahasuerus they cast pur that is the lot before haman from
day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month that is
the month adar
and haman said unto king ahasuerus there is a certain people
scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces
of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people neither
keep they the kings laws therefore it is not for the kings profit
to suffer them
if it please the king let it be written that they may be
destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands
of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the
kings treasuries
and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto haman
the son of hammedatha the agagite the jews enemy
and the king said unto haman the silver is given to thee the
people also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee
then were the kings scribes called on the thirteenth day of the
first month and there was written according to all that haman had
commanded unto the kings lieutenants and to the governors that were
over every province and to the rulers of every people of every
province according to the writing thereof and to every people after
their language in the name of king ahasuerus was it written and
sealed with the kings ring
and the letters were sent by posts into all the kings provinces
to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all jews both young and
old little children and women in one day even upon the thirteenth
day of the twelfth month which is the month adar and to take the
spoil of them for a prey
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
province was published unto all people that they should be ready
against that day
the posts went out being hastened by the kings commandment and
the decree was given in shushan the palace and the king and haman sat
down to drink but the city shushan was perplexed
when mordecai perceived all that was done mordecai rent his
clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst
of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry  and came even
before the kings gate for none might enter into the kings gate
clothed with sackcloth
and in every province whithersoever the kings commandment and
his decree came there was great mourning among the jews and fasting
and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes
so esthers maids and her chamberlains came and told it her then
was the queen exceedingly grieved and she sent raiment to clothe
mordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him but he received it
not
then called esther for hatach one of the kings chamberlains
whom he had appointed to attend upon her and gave him a commandment
to mordecai to know what it was and why it was
so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city
which was before the kings gate
and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of
the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the kings
treasuries for the jews to destroy them
also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was
given at shushan to destroy them to shew it unto esther and to
declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the
king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him
for her people
and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai
again esther spake unto hatach and gave him commandment unto
mordecai  all the kings servants and the people of the kings
provinces do know that whosoever whether man or women shall come
unto the king into the inner court who is not called there is one
law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall
hold out the golden sceptre that he may live but i have not been
called to come in unto the king these thirty days
and they told to mordecai esthers words
then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyself
that thou shalt escape in the kings house more than all the jews
for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall
there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another
place but thou and thy fathers house shall be destroyed and who
knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this
then esther bade them return mordecai this answer  go
gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye
for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and
my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king
which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish
so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther
had commanded him
now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal
apparel and stood in the inner court of the kings house over
against the kings house and the king sat upon his royal throne in
the royal house over against the gate of the house
and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the
court that she obtained favour in his sight and the king held out to
esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand so esther drew near
and touched the top of the sceptre
then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther and
what is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of the
kingdom
and esther answered if it seem good unto the king let the king
and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him
then the king said cause haman to make haste that he may do as
esther hath said so the king and haman came to the banquet that
esther had prepared
and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thy
petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even
to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed
then answered esther and said my petition and my request is
if i have found favour in the sight of the king and if it please the
king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and
haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will do
to morrow as the king hath said
then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart but
when haman saw mordecai in the kings gate that he stood not up nor
moved for him he was full of indignation against mordecai
nevertheless haman refrained himself and when he came home he
sent and called for his friends and zeresh his wife
and haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude
of his children and all the things wherein the king had promoted him
and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the
king
haman said moreover yea esther the queen did let no man come in
with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself and
to morrow am i invited unto her also with the king
yet all this availeth me nothing so long as i see mordecai the
jew sitting at the kings gate
then said zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him let a
gallows be made of fifty cubits high and to morrow speak thou unto
the king that mordecai may be hanged thereon then go thou in merrily
with the king unto the banquet and the thing pleased haman and he
caused the gallows to be made
on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring
the book of records of the chronicles and they were read before the
king
and it was found written that mordecai had told of bigthana and
teresh two of the kings chamberlains the keepers of the door who
sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus
and the king said what honour and dignity hath been done to
mordecai for this then said the kings servants that ministered unto
him there is nothing done for him
and the king said who is in the court now haman was come into
the outward court of the kings house to speak unto the king to hang
mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him
and the kings servants said unto him behold haman standeth in
the court and the king said let him come in
so haman came in and the king said unto him what shall be done
unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour now haman thought in
his heart to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to
myself   and haman answered the king for the man whom the king
delighteth to honour  let the royal apparel be brought which the
king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the
crown royal which is set upon his head  and let this apparel and
horse be delivered to the hand of one of the kings most noble
princes that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth
to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the city
and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the
king delighteth to honour
then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel and
the horse as thou hast said and do even so to mordecai the jew that
sitteth at the kings gate let nothing fail of all that thou hast
spoken
then took haman the apparel and the horse and arrayed mordecai
and brought him on horseback through the street of the city and
proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man whom the
king delighteth to honour
and mordecai came again to the kings gate but haman hasted to
his house mourning and having his head covered
and haman told zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing
that had befallen him then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto
him if mordecai be of the seed of the jews before whom thou hast
begun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surely
fall before him
and while they were yet talking with him came the kings
chamberlains and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther
had prepared
so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen
and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the
banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be
granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even
to the half of the kingdom
then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favour in
thy sight o king and if it please the king let my life be given me
at my petition and my people at my request  for we are sold i
and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we
had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen i had held my tongue
although the enemy could not countervail the kings damage
then the king ahasuerus answered and said unto esther the queen
who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so
and esther said the adversary and enemy is this wicked haman
then haman was afraid before the king and the queen
and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went
into the palace garden and haman stood up to make request for his
life to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined
against him by the king
then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of
the banquet of wine and haman was fallen upon the bed whereon esther
was then said the king will he force the queen also before me in the
house as the word went out of kings mouth they covered hamans
face
and harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the king
behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which haman had made for
mordecai who spoken good for the king standeth in the house of
haman then the king said hang him thereon
so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
mordecai then was the kings wrath pacified
on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the
jews enemy unto esther the queen and mordecai came before the king
for esther had told what he was unto her
and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and
gave it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of
haman
and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his
feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman
the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews
then the king held out the golden sceptre toward esther so esther
arose and stood before the king  and said if it please the king
and if i have favour in his sight and the thing seem right before the
king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the
letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite which he
wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the kings provinces
for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people
or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred   then
the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew
behold i have given esther the house of haman and him they have
hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews
write ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the kings name
and seal it with the kings ring for the writing which is written in
the kings name and sealed with the kings ring may no man reverse
then were the kings scribes called at that time in the third
month that is the month sivan on the three and twentieth day
thereof and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded
unto the jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and rulers of
the provinces which are from india unto ethiopia an hundred twenty
and seven provinces unto every province according to the writing
thereof and unto every people after their language and to the jews
according to their writing and according to their language
and he wrote in the king ahasuerus name and sealed it with the
kings ring and sent letters by posts on horseback and riders on
mules camels and young dromedaries  wherein the king granted
the jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and
to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish
all the power of the people and province that would assault them both
little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey
upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus namely upon the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
province was published unto all people and that the jews should be
ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies
so the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out being
hastened and pressed on by the kings commandment and the decree was
given at shushan the palace
and mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a
garment of fine linen and purple and the city of shushan rejoiced and
was glad
the jews had light and gladness and joy and honour
and in every province and in every city whithersoever the
kings commandment and his decree came the jews had joy and gladness
a feast and a good day and many of the people of the land became
jews for the fear of the jews fell upon them
now in the twelfth month that is the month adar on the
thirteenth day of the same when the kings commandment and his decree
drew near to be put in execution in the day that the enemies of the
jews hoped to have power over them though it was turned to the
contrary that the jews had rule over them that hated them  the
jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the
provinces of the king ahasuerus to lay hand on such as sought their
hurt and no man could withstand them for the fear of them fell upon
all people
and all the rulers of the provinces and the lieutenants and the
deputies and officers of the king helped the jews because the fear
of mordecai fell upon them
for mordecai was great in the kings house and his fame went out
throughout all the provinces for this man mordecai waxed greater and
greater
thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto
those that hated them
and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred
men
and parshandatha and dalphon and aspatha  and poratha and
adalia and aridatha  and parmashta and arisai and aridai and
vajezatha  the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the enemy
of the jews slew they but on the spoil laid they not their hand
on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the
palace was brought before the king
and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and
destroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace and the ten sons of
haman what have they done in the rest of the kings provinces now
what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thy
request further and it shall be done
then said esther if it please the king let it be granted to the
jews which are in shushan to do to morrow also according unto this
days decree and let hamans ten sons be hanged upon the gallows
and the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given
at shushan and they hanged hamans ten sons
for the jews that were in shushan gathered themselves together on
the fourteenth day also of the month adar and slew three hundred men
at shushan but on the prey they laid not their hand
but the other jews that were in the kings provinces gathered
themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from
their enemies and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand but
they laid not their hands on the prey  on the thirteenth day of
the month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they and
made it a day of feasting and gladness
but the jews that were at shushan assembled together on the
thirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof and on the
fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting
and gladness
therefore the jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled
towns made the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of gladness and
feasting and a good day and of sending portions one to another
and mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the
jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus both nigh
and far  to stablish this among them that they should keep the
fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same
yearly  as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemies
and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from
mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting
and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the
poor
and the jews undertook to do as they had begun and as mordecai
had written unto them  because haman the son of hammedatha the
agagite the enemy of all the jews had devised against the jews to
destroy them and had cast pur that is the lot to consume them and
to destroy them  but when esther came before the king he
commanded by letters that his wicked device which he devised against
the jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sons
should be hanged on the gallows
wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur
therefore for all the words of this letter and of that which they had
seen concerning this matter and which had come unto them  the
jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all
such as joined themselves unto them so as it should not fail that
they would keep these two days according to their writing and
according to their appointed time every year  and that these days
should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every
family every province and every city and that these days of purim
should not fail from among the jews nor the memorial of them perish
from their seed
then esther the queen the daughter of abihail and mordecai the
jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim
and he sent the letters unto all the jews to the hundred twenty
and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus with words of peace
and truth  to confirm these days of purim in their times
appointed according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had
enjoined them and as they had decreed for themselves and for their
seed the matters of the fastings and their cry
and the decree of esther confirmed these matters of purim and it
was written in the book
and the king ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and upon the
isles of the sea
and all the acts of his power and of his might and the
declaration of the greatness of mordecai whereunto the king advanced
him are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of media and persia   for mordecai the jew was next unto king
ahasuerus and great among the jews and accepted of the multitude of
his brethren seeking the wealth of his people and speaking peace to
all his seed
the book of job
there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job and that
man was perfect and upright and one that feared god and eschewed evil
and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters
his substance also was seven thousand sheep and three thousand
camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred she asses and
a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the
men of the east
and his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his day
and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with
them
and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about
that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning
and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for
job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their
hearts thus did job continually
now there was a day when the sons of god came to present
themselves before the lord and satan came also among them
and the lord said unto satan whence comest thou then satan
answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and
from walking up and down in it
and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job
that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright
man one that feareth god and escheweth evil   then satan
answered the lord and said doth job fear god for nought   hast
not thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all
that he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands
and his substance is increased in the land
but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he
will curse thee to thy face
and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy
power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forth
from the presence of the lord
and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating
and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house  and there came
a messenger unto job and said the oxen were plowing and the asses
feeding beside them  and the sabeans fell upon them and took
them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the
sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the
fire of god is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and
the servants and consumed them and i only am escaped alone to tell
thee
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the
chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have
carried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the
sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee
while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy
sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest
brothers house  and behold there came a great wind from the
wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon
the young men and they are dead and i only am escaped alone to tell
thee
then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and
fell down upon the ground and worshipped  and said naked came i
out of my mothers womb and naked shall i return thither the lord
gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord
in all this job sinned not nor charged god foolishly
again there was a day when the sons of god came to present
themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present
himself before the lord
and the lord said unto satan from whence comest thou and satan
answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and
from walking up and down in it
and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job
that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright
man one that feareth god and escheweth evil and still he holdeth
fast his integrity although thou movedst me against him to destroy
him without cause
and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yea all
that a man hath will he give for his life
but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh
and he will curse thee to thy face
and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but
save his life
so went satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote job
with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown
and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal and he sat
down among the ashes
then said his wife unto him dost thou still retain thine
integrity  curse god and die
but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women
speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we
not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips
now when jobs three friends heard of all this evil that was come
upon him they came every one from his own place eliphaz the
temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite for they
had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to
comfort him
and when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not
they lifted up their voice and wept and they rent every one his
mantle and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven
so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
nights and none spake a word unto him for they saw that his grief
was very great
after this opened job his mouth and cursed his day
and job spake and said  let the day perish wherein i was
born and the night in which it was said there is a man child
conceived
let that day be darkness let not god regard it from above
neither let the light shine upon it
let darkness and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwell
upon it let the blackness of the day terrify it
as for that night let darkness seize upon it let it not be
joined unto the days of the year let it not come into the number of
the months
lo let that night be solitary let no joyful voice come therein
let them curse it that curse the day who are ready to raise up
their mourning
let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark let it look for
light but have none neither let it see the dawning of the day
because it shut not up the doors of my mothers womb nor hid sorrow
from mine eyes
why died i not from the womb why did i not give up the ghost
when i came out of the belly   why did the knees prevent me or
why the breasts that i should suck   for now should i have lain
still and been quiet i should have slept then had i been at rest
with kings and counsellors of the earth which build desolate
places for themselves  or with princes that had gold who filled
their houses with silver  or as an hidden untimely birth i had
not been as infants which never saw light
there the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at
rest
there the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the
oppressor
the small and great are there and the servant is free from his
master
wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life unto
the bitter in soul  which long for death but it cometh not and
dig for it more than for hid treasures  which rejoice
exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave   why is
light given to a man whose way is hid and whom god hath hedged in
for my sighing cometh before i eat and my roarings are poured
out like the waters
for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me and that
which i was afraid of is come unto me
i was not in safety neither had i rest neither was i quiet yet
trouble came
then eliphaz the temanite answered and said  if we assay to
commune with thee wilt thou be grieved but who can withhold himself
from speaking   behold thou hast instructed many and thou hast
strengthened the weak hands
thy words have upholden him that was falling and thou hast
strengthened the feeble knees
but now it is come upon thee and thou faintest it toucheth thee
and thou art troubled
is not this thy fear thy confidence thy hope and the
uprightness of thy ways   remember i pray thee who ever
perished being innocent or where were the righteous cut off
even as i have seen they that plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap
the same
by the blast of god they perish and by the breath of his nostrils
are they consumed
the roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and
the teeth of the young lions are broken
the old lion perisheth for lack of prey and the stout lions
whelps are scattered abroad
now a thing was secretly brought to me and mine ear received a
little thereof
in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep
falleth on men  fear came upon me and trembling which made all
my bones to shake
then a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood
up  it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof an
image was before mine eyes there was silence and i heard a voice
saying  shall mortal man be more just than god shall a man be
more pure than his maker   behold he put no trust in his
servants and his angels he charged with folly  how much less in
them that dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dust
which are crushed before the moth   they are destroyed from
morning to evening they perish for ever without any regarding it
doth not their excellency which is in them go away they die
even without wisdom
call now if there be any that will answer thee and to which of
the saints wilt thou turn   for wrath killeth the foolish man and
envy slayeth the silly one
i have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly i cursed his
habitation
his children are far from safety and they are crushed in the
gate neither is there any to deliver them
whose harvest the hungry eateth up and taketh it even out of the
thorns and the robber swalloweth up their substance
although affliction cometh not forth of the dust neither doth
trouble spring out of the ground  yet man is born unto trouble as
the sparks fly upward
i would seek unto god and unto god would i commit my cause
which doeth great things and unsearchable marvellous things without
number  who giveth rain upon the earth and sendeth waters upon
the fields  to set up on high those that be low that those which
mourn may be exalted to safety
he disappointeth the devices of the crafty so that their hands
cannot perform their enterprise
he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and the counsel of
the froward is carried headlong
they meet with darkness in the day time and grope in the noonday
as in the night
but he saveth the poor from the sword from their mouth and from
the hand of the mighty
so the poor hath hope and iniquity stoppeth her mouth
behold happy is the man whom god correcteth therefore despise
not thou the chastening of the almighty  for he maketh sore and
bindeth up he woundeth and his hands make whole
he shall deliver thee in six troubles yea in seven there shall
no evil touch thee
in famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from the
power of the sword
thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue neither shalt
thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh
at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh neither shalt thou be
afraid of the beasts of the earth
for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field and the
beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee
and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace and
thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sin
thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great and thine
offspring as the grass of the earth
thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age like as a shock of
corn cometh in in his season
lo this we have searched it so it is hear it and know thou it
for thy good
but job answered and said  oh that my grief were throughly
weighed and my calamity laid in the balances together   for now
it would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words are
swallowed up
for the arrows of the almighty are within me the poison whereof
drinketh up my spirit the terrors of god do set themselves in array
against me
doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass or loweth the ox over
his fodder   can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt or
is there any taste in the white of an egg   the things that my
soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat
oh that i might have my request and that god would grant me the
thing that i long for   even that it would please god to destroy
me that he would let loose his hand and cut me off   then
should i yet have comfort yea i would harden myself in sorrow let
him not spare for i have not concealed the words of the holy one
what is my strength that i should hope and what is mine end
that i should prolong my life   is my strength the strength of
stones or is my flesh of brass   is not my help in me and is
wisdom driven quite from me   to him that is afflicted pity
should be shewed from his friend but he forsaketh the fear of the
almighty
my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook and as the stream
of brooks they pass away  which are blackish by reason of the
ice and wherein the snow is hid  what time they wax warm they
vanish when it is hot they are consumed out of their place
the paths of their way are turned aside they go to nothing and
perish
the troops of tema looked the companies of sheba waited for
them
they were confounded because they had hoped they came thither
and were ashamed
for now ye are nothing ye see my casting down and are afraid
did i say bring unto me or give a reward for me of your
substance   or deliver me from the enemys hand or redeem me
from the hand of the mighty   teach me and i will hold my
tongue and cause me to understand wherein i have erred
how forcible are right words but what doth your arguing reprove
do ye imagine to reprove words and the speeches of one that is
desperate which are as wind   yea ye overwhelm the fatherless
and ye dig a pit for your friend
now therefore be content look upon me for it is evident unto
you if i lie
return i pray you let it not be iniquity yea return again my
righteousness is in it
is there iniquity in my tongue cannot my taste discern perverse
things   is there not an appointed time to man upon earth are not
his days also like the days of an hireling   as a servant
earnestly desireth the shadow and as an hireling looketh for the
reward of his work  so am i made to possess months of vanity and
wearisome nights are appointed to me
when i lie down i say when shall i arise and the night be gone
and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day
my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust my skin is
broken and become loathsome
my days are swifter than a weavers shuttle and are spent without
hope
o remember that my life is wind mine eye shall no more see good
the eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more thine eyes
are upon me and i am not
as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away so he that goeth down
to the grave shall come up no more
he shall return no more to his house neither shall his place
know him any more
therefore i will not refrain my mouth i will speak in the
anguish of my spirit i will complain in the bitterness of my soul
am i a sea or a whale that thou settest a watch over me
when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my
complaints  then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me
through visions  so that my soul chooseth strangling and death
rather than my life
i loathe it i would not live alway let me alone for my days
are vanity
what is man that thou shouldest magnify him and that thou
shouldest set thine heart upon him   and that thou shouldest
visit him every morning and try him every moment   how long wilt
thou not depart from me nor let me alone till i swallow down my
spittle   i have sinned what shall i do unto thee o thou
preserver of men  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so
that i am a burden to myself   and why dost thou not pardon my
transgression and take away my iniquity for now shall i sleep in the
dust and thou shalt seek me in the morning but i shall not be
then answered bildad the shuhite and said  how long wilt thou
speak these things and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like
a strong wind   doth god pervert judgment or doth the almighty
pervert justice   if thy children have sinned against him and he
have cast them away for their transgression  if thou wouldest seek
unto god betimes and make thy supplication to the almighty  if
thou wert pure and upright surely now he would awake for thee and
make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous
though thy beginning was small yet thy latter end should greatly
increase
for enquire i pray thee of the former age and prepare thyself
to the search of their fathers  for we are but of yesterday and
know nothing because our days upon earth are a shadow  shall
not they teach thee and tell thee and utter words out of their
heart   can the rush grow up without mire can the flag grow
without water   whilst it is yet in his greenness and not cut
down it withereth before any other herb
so are the paths of all that forget god and the hypocrites hope
shall perish  whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall
be a spiders web
he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall
hold it fast but it shall not endure
he is green before the sun and his branch shooteth forth in his
garden
his roots are wrapped about the heap and seeth the place of
stones
if he destroy him from his place then it shall deny him saying
i have not seen thee
behold this is the joy of his way and out of the earth shall
others grow
behold god will not cast away a perfect man neither will he
help the evil doers  till he fill thy mouth with laughing and
thy lips with rejoicing
they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame and the dwelling
place of the wicked shall come to nought
then job answered and said  i know it is so of a truth but
how should man be just with god   if he will contend with him he
cannot answer him one of a thousand
he is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardened
himself against him and hath prospered   which removeth the
mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger
which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillars thereof
tremble
which commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up the
stars
which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves
of the sea
which maketh arcturus orion and pleiades and the chambers of
the south
which doeth great things past finding out yea and wonders
without number
lo he goeth by me and i see him not he passeth on also but i
perceive him not
behold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say unto
him what doest thou   if god will not withdraw his anger the
proud helpers do stoop under him
how much less shall i answer him and choose out my words to
reason with him   whom though i were righteous yet would i not
answer but i would make supplication to my judge
if i had called and he had answered me yet would i not believe
that he had hearkened unto my voice
for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplieth my wounds
without cause
he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with
bitterness
if i speak of strength lo he is strong and if of judgment who
shall set me a time to plead   if i justify myself mine own
mouth shall condemn me if i say i am perfect it shall also prove me
perverse
though i were perfect yet would i not know my soul i would
despise my life
this is one thing therefore i said it he destroyeth the perfect
and the wicked
if the scourge slay suddenly he will laugh at the trial of the
innocent
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covereth the
faces of the judges thereof if not where and who is he   now
my days are swifter than a post they flee away they see no good
they are passed away as the swift ships as the eagle that
hasteth to the prey
if i say i will forget my complaint i will leave off my
heaviness and comfort myself  i am afraid of all my sorrows i
know that thou wilt not hold me innocent
if i be wicked why then labour i in vain   if i wash myself
with snow water and make my hands never so clean  yet shalt thou
plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me
for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and we
should come together in judgment
neither is there any daysman betwixt us that might lay his hand
upon us both
let him take his rod away from me and let not his fear terrify
me  then would i speak and not fear him but it is not so with
me
my soul is weary of my life i will leave my complaint upon
myself i will speak in the bitterness of my soul
i will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefore thou
contendest with me
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thou
shouldest despise the work of thine hands and shine upon the counsel
of the wicked   hast thou eyes of flesh or seest thou as man
seeth   are thy days as the days of man are thy years as mans
days  that thou enquirest after mine iniquity and searchest
after my sin   thou knowest that i am not wicked and there is
none that can deliver out of thine hand
thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about
yet thou dost destroy me
remember i beseech thee that thou hast made me as the clay and
wilt thou bring me into dust again   hast thou not poured me out
as milk and curdled me like cheese   thou hast clothed me with
skin and flesh and hast fenced me with bones and sinews
thou hast granted me life and favour and thy visitation hath
preserved my spirit
and these things hast thou hid in thine heart i know that this
is with thee
if i sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from
mine iniquity
if i be wicked woe unto me and if i be righteous yet will i
not lift up my head i am full of confusion therefore see thou mine
affliction  for it increaseth thou huntest me as a fierce lion
and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me
thou renewest thy witnesses against me and increasest thine
indignation upon me changes and war are against me
wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb oh
that i had given up the ghost and no eye had seen me   i should
have been as though i had not been i should have been carried from
the womb to the grave
are not my days few cease then and let me alone that i may
take comfort a little  before i go whence i shall not return
even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death  a land of
darkness as darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any
order and where the light is as darkness
then answered zophar the naamathite and said  should not
the multitude of words be answered and should a man full of talk be
justified   should thy lies make men hold their peace and when
thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed   for thou hast
said my doctrine is pure and i am clean in thine eyes
but oh that god would speak and open his lips against thee
and that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom that they are
double to that which is know therefore that god exacteth of thee less
than thine iniquity deserveth
canst thou by searching find out god canst thou find out the
almighty unto perfection   it is as high as heaven what canst
thou do deeper than hell what canst thou know   the measure
thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea
if he cut off and shut up or gather together then who can
hinder him   for he knoweth vain men he seeth wickedness also
will he not then consider it   for vain men would be wise
though man be born like a wild asss colt
if thou prepare thine heart and stretch out thine hands toward
him  if iniquity be in thine hand put it far away and let not
wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles
for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thou
shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear  because thou shalt forget
thy misery and remember it as waters that pass away  and thine
age shall be clearer than the noonday thou shalt shine forth thou
shalt be as the morning
and thou shalt be secure because there is hope yea thou shalt
dig about thee and thou shalt take thy rest in safety
also thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid yea
many shall make suit unto thee
but the eyes of the wicked shall fail and they shall not
escape and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost
and job answered and said  no doubt but ye are the people
and wisdom shall die with you
but i have understanding as well as you i am not inferior to
you yea who knoweth not such things as these   i am as one
mocked of his neighbour who calleth upon god and he answereth him
the just upright man is laughed to scorn
he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in
the thought of him that is at ease
the tabernacles of robbers prosper and they that provoke god are
secure into whose hand god bringeth abundantly
but ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee and the fowls
of the air and they shall tell thee  or speak to the earth and
it shall teach thee and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto
thee
who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath
wrought this   in whose hand is the soul of every living thing
and the breath of all mankind
doth not the ear try words and the mouth taste his meat
with the ancient is wisdom and in length of days understanding
with him is wisdom and strength he hath counsel and
understanding
behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again he
shutteth up a man and there can be no opening
behold he withholdeth the waters and they dry up also he
sendeth them out and they overturn the earth
with him is strength and wisdom the deceived and the deceiver
are his
he leadeth counsellors away spoiled and maketh the judges
fools
he looseth the bond of kings and girdeth their loins with a
girdle
he leadeth princes away spoiled and overthroweth the mighty
he removeth away the speech of the trusty and taketh away the
understanding of the aged
he poureth contempt upon princes and weakeneth the strength of
the mighty
he discovereth deep things out of darkness and bringeth out to
light the shadow of death
he increaseth the nations and destroyeth them he enlargeth the
nations and straiteneth them again
he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the
earth and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no
way
they grope in the dark without light and he maketh them to
stagger like a drunken man
lo mine eye hath seen all this mine ear hath heard and
understood it
what ye know the same do i know also i am not inferior unto
you
surely i would speak to the almighty and i desire to reason with
god
but ye are forgers of lies ye are all physicians of no value
o that ye would altogether hold your peace and it should be your
wisdom
hear now my reasoning and hearken to the pleadings of my lips
will ye speak wickedly for god and talk deceitfully for him
will ye accept his person will ye contend for god   is it
good that he should search you out or as one man mocketh another do
ye so mock him   he will surely reprove you if ye do secretly
accept persons
shall not his excellency make you afraid and his dread fall
upon you   your remembrances are like unto ashes your bodies to
bodies of clay
hold your peace let me alone that i may speak and let come on
me what will
wherefore do i take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in
mine hand   though he slay me yet will i trust in him but i
will maintain mine own ways before him
he also shall be my salvation for an hypocrite shall not come
before him
hear diligently my speech and my declaration with your ears
behold now i have ordered my cause i know that i shall be
justified
who is he that will plead with me for now if i hold my tongue
i shall give up the ghost
only do not two things unto me then will i not hide myself from
thee
withdraw thine hand far from me and let not thy dread make me
afraid
then call thou and i will answer or let me speak and answer
thou me
how many are mine iniquities and sins make me to know my
transgression and my sin
wherefore hidest thou thy face and holdest me for thine enemy
wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro and wilt thou pursue
the dry stubble   for thou writest bitter things against me and
makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth
thou puttest my feet also in the stocks and lookest narrowly
unto all my paths thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet
and he as a rotten thing consumeth as a garment that is moth
eaten
man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble
he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as
a shadow and continueth not
and doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one and bringest me
into judgment with thee   who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean not one
seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with
thee thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass  turn
from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as an hireling
his day
for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will
sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease
though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock
thereof die in the ground  yet through the scent of water it will
bud and bring forth boughs like a plant
but man dieth and wasteth away yea man giveth up the ghost
and where is he   as the waters fail from the sea and the flood
decayeth and drieth up  so man lieth down and riseth not till
the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of
their sleep
o that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest
keep me secret until thy wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint me
a set time and remember me   if a man die shall he live again
all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come
thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desire
to the work of thine hands
for now thou numberest my steps dost thou not watch over my
sin   my transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou sewest up
mine iniquity
and surely the mountains falling cometh to nought and the rock
is removed out of his place
the waters wear the stones thou washest away the things which
grow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope of
man
thou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth thou
changest his countenance and sendest him away
his sons come to honour and he knoweth it not and they are
brought low but he perceiveth it not of them
but his flesh upon him shall have pain and his soul within him
shall mourn
then answered eliphaz the temanite and said  should a wise
man utter vain knowledge and fill his belly with the east wind
should he reason with unprofitable talk or with speeches wherewith he
can do no good   yea thou castest off fear and restrainest
prayer before god
for thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity and thou choosest the
tongue of the crafty
thine own mouth condemneth thee and not i yea thine own lips
testify against thee
art thou the first man that was born or wast thou made before
the hills   hast thou heard the secret of god and dost thou
restrain wisdom to thyself   what knowest thou that we know not
what understandest thou which is not in us   with us are both
the grayheaded and very aged men much elder than thy father
are the consolations of god small with thee is there any secret
thing with thee   why doth thine heart carry thee away and what
do thy eyes wink at  that thou turnest thy spirit against god
and lettest such words go out of thy mouth   what is man that
he should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be
righteous   behold he putteth no trust in his saints yea the
heavens are not clean in his sight
how much more abominable and filthy is man which drinketh
iniquity like water   i will shew thee hear me and that which
i have seen i will declare  which wise men have told from their
fathers and have not hid it  unto whom alone the earth was
given and no stranger passed among them
the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days and the number
of years is hidden to the oppressor
a dreadful sound is in his ears in prosperity the destroyer
shall come upon him
he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness and he is
waited for of the sword
he wandereth abroad for bread saying where is it he knoweth
that the day of darkness is ready at his hand
trouble and anguish shall make him afraid they shall prevail
against him as a king ready to the battle
for he stretcheth out his hand against god and strengtheneth
himself against the almighty
he runneth upon him even on his neck upon the thick bosses of
his bucklers  because he covereth his face with his fatness and
maketh collops of fat on his flanks
and he dwelleth in desolate cities and in houses which no man
inhabiteth which are ready to become heaps
he shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue
neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth
he shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his
branches and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away
let not him that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall
be his recompence
it shall be accomplished before his time and his branch shall
not be green
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine and shall cast
off his flower as the olive
for the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate and fire
shall consume the tabernacles of bribery
they conceive mischief and bring forth vanity and their belly
prepareth deceit
then job answered and said  i have heard many such things
miserable comforters are ye all
shall vain words have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thou
answerest   i also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my
souls stead i could heap up words against you and shake mine head
at you
but i would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my
lips should asswage your grief
though i speak my grief is not asswaged and though i forbear
what am i eased   but now he hath made me weary thou hast made
desolate all my company
and thou hast filled me with wrinkles which is a witness against
me and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face
he teareth me in his wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon me
with his teeth mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me
they have gaped upon me with their mouth they have smitten me
upon the cheek reproachfully they have gathered themselves together
against me
god hath delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over into
the hands of the wicked
i was at ease but he hath broken me asunder he hath also taken
me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark
his archers compass me round about he cleaveth my reins
asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground
he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like
a giant
i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and defiled my horn in the
dust
my face is foul with weeping and on my eyelids is the shadow of
death  not for any injustice in mine hands also my prayer is
pure
o earth cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no place
also now behold my witness is in heaven and my record is on
high
my friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto god
o that one might plead for a man with god as a man pleadeth for
his neighbour   when a few years are come then i shall go the
way whence i shall not return
my breath is corrupt my days are extinct the graves are ready
for me
are there not mockers with me and doth not mine eye continue in
their provocation   lay down now put me in a surety with thee
who is he that will strike hands with me   for thou hast hid
their heart from understanding therefore shalt thou not exalt them
he that speaketh flattery to his friends even the eyes of his
children shall fail
he hath made me also a byword of the people and aforetime i was
as a tabret
mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my members are
as a shadow
upright men shall be astonied at this and the innocent shall
stir up himself against the hypocrite
the righteous also shall hold on his way and he that hath clean
hands shall be stronger and stronger
but as for you all do ye return and come now for i cannot
find one wise man among you
my days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts
of my heart
they change the night into day the light is short because of
darkness
if i wait the grave is mine house i have made my bed in the
darkness
i have said to corruption thou art my father to the worm thou
art my mother and my sister
and where is now my hope as for my hope who shall see it
they shall go down to the bars of the pit when our rest
together is in the dust
then answered bildad the shuhite and said  how long will it
be ere ye make an end of words mark and afterwards we will speak
wherefore are we counted as beasts and reputed vile in your
sight   he teareth himself in his anger shall the earth be
forsaken for thee and shall the rock be removed out of his place
yea the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark of
his fire shall not shine
the light shall be dark in his tabernacle and his candle shall
be put out with him
the steps of his strength shall be straitened and his own
counsel shall cast him down
for he is cast into a net by his own feet and he walketh upon a
snare
the gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevail
against him
the snare is laid for him in the ground and a trap for him in
the way
terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall drive him
to his feet
his strength shall be hungerbitten and destruction shall be
ready at his side
it shall devour the strength of his skin even the firstborn of
death shall devour his strength
his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle and it
shall bring him to the king of terrors
it shall dwell in his tabernacle because it is none of his
brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation
his roots shall be dried up beneath and above shall his branch
be cut off
his remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have
no name in the street
he shall be driven from light into darkness and chased out of
the world
he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people nor any
remaining in his dwellings
they that come after him shall be astonied at his day as they
that went before were affrighted
surely such are the dwellings of the wicked and this is the
place of him that knoweth not god
then job answered and said  how long will ye vex my soul
and break me in pieces with words   these ten times have ye
reproached me ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to
me
and be it indeed that i have erred mine error remaineth with
myself
if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me and plead
against me my reproach  know now that god hath overthrown me and
hath compassed me with his net
behold i cry out of wrong but i am not heard i cry aloud but
there is no judgment
he hath fenced up my way that i cannot pass and he hath set
darkness in my paths
he hath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my
head
he hath destroyed me on every side and i am gone and mine hope
hath he removed like a tree
he hath also kindled his wrath against me and he counteth me
unto him as one of his enemies
his troops come together and raise up their way against me and
encamp round about my tabernacle
he hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaintance are
verily estranged from me
my kinsfolk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten
me
they that dwell in mine house and my maids count me for a
stranger i am an alien in their sight
i called my servant and he gave me no answer i intreated him
with my mouth
my breath is strange to my wife though i intreated for the
childrens sake of mine own body
yea young children despised me i arose and they spake against
me
all my inward friends abhorred me and they whom i loved are
turned against me
my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and i am escaped
with the skin of my teeth
have pity upon me have pity upon me o ye my friends for the
hand of god hath touched me
why do ye persecute me as god and are not satisfied with my
flesh   oh that my words were now written oh that they were
printed in a book   that they were graven with an iron pen and
lead in the rock for ever   for i know that my redeemer liveth
and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth  and
though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i
see god  whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shall
behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me
but ye should say why persecute we him seeing the root of the
matter is found in me   be ye afraid of the sword for wrath
bringeth the punishments of the sword that ye may know there is a
judgment
then answered zophar the naamathite and said  therefore do
my thoughts cause me to answer and for this i make haste
i have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my
understanding causeth me to answer
knowest thou not this of old since man was placed upon earth
that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the
hypocrite but for a moment   though his excellency mount up to
the heavens and his head reach unto the clouds  yet he shall
perish for ever like his own dung they which have seen him shall say
where is he   he shall fly away as a dream and shall not be
found yea he shall be chased away as a vision of the night
the eye also which saw him shall see him no more neither shall
his place any more behold him
his children shall seek to please the poor and his hands shall
restore their goods
his bones are full of the sin of his youth which shall lie down
with him in the dust
though wickedness be sweet in his mouth though he hide it under
his tongue  though he spare it and forsake it not but keep it
still within his mouth  yet his meat in his bowels is turned it
is the gall of asps within him
he hath swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again
god shall cast them out of his belly
he shall suck the poison of asps the vipers tongue shall slay
him
he shall not see the rivers the floods the brooks of honey and
butter
that which he laboured for shall he restore and shall not
swallow it down according to his substance shall the restitution be
and he shall not rejoice therein
because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor because he
hath violently taken away an house which he builded not  surely
he shall not feel quietness in his belly he shall not save of that
which he desired
there shall none of his meat be left therefore shall no man
look for his goods
in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits every
hand of the wicked shall come upon him
when he is about to fill his belly god shall cast the fury of
his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eating
he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall
strike him through
it is drawn and cometh out of the body yea the glittering
sword cometh out of his gall terrors are upon him
all darkness shall be hid in his secret places a fire not blown
shall consume him it shall go ill with him that is left in his
tabernacle
the heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise
up against him
the increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flow
away in the day of his wrath
this is the portion of a wicked man from god and the heritage
appointed unto him by god
but job answered and said  hear diligently my speech and
let this be your consolations
suffer me that i may speak and after that i have spoken mock
on
as for me is my complaint to man and if it were so why should
not my spirit be troubled   mark me and be astonished and lay
your hand upon your mouth
even when i remember i am afraid and trembling taketh hold on my
flesh
wherefore do the wicked live become old yea are mighty in
power   their seed is established in their sight with them and
their offspring before their eyes
their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon
them
their bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth and
casteth not her calf
they send forth their little ones like a flock and their
children dance
they take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the
organ
they spend their days in wealth and in a moment go down to the
grave
therefore they say unto god depart from us for we desire not
the knowledge of thy ways
what is the almighty that we should serve him and what profit
should we have if we pray unto him   lo their good is not in
their hand the counsel of the wicked is far from me
how oft is the candle of the wicked put out and how oft cometh
their destruction upon them god distributeth sorrows in his anger
they are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm
carrieth away
god layeth up his iniquity for his children he rewardeth him
and he shall know it
his eyes shall see his destruction and he shall drink of the
wrath of the almighty
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the
number of his months is cut off in the midst   shall any teach
god knowledge seeing he judgeth those that are high
one dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet
his breasts are full of milk and his bones are moistened with
marrow
and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never
eateth with pleasure
they shall lie down alike in the dust and the worms shall cover
them
behold i know your thoughts and the devices which ye
wrongfully imagine against me
for ye say where is the house of the prince and where are the
dwelling places of the wicked   have ye not asked them that go
by the way and do ye not know their tokens  that the wicked is
reserved to the day of destruction they shall be brought forth to the
day of wrath
who shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay him
what he hath done   yet shall he be brought to the grave and
shall remain in the tomb
the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him and every man
shall draw after him as there are innumerable before him
how then comfort ye me in vain seeing in your answers there
remaineth falsehood   then eliphaz the temanite answered and
said  can a man be profitable unto god as he that is wise may be
profitable unto himself   is it any pleasure to the almighty
that thou art righteous or is it gain to him that thou makest thy
ways perfect   will he reprove thee for fear of thee will he
enter with thee into judgment   is not thy wickedness great and
thine iniquities infinite   for thou hast taken a pledge from thy
brother for nought and stripped the naked of their clothing
thou hast not given water to the weary to drink and thou hast
withholden bread from the hungry
but as for the mighty man he had the earth and the honourable
man dwelt in it
thou hast sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherless
have been broken
therefore snares are round about thee and sudden fear troubleth
thee  or darkness that thou canst not see and abundance of
waters cover thee
is not god in the height of heaven and behold the height of the
stars how high they are   and thou sayest how doth god know
can he judge through the dark cloud   thick clouds are a
covering to him that he seeth not and he walketh in the circuit of
heaven
hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden
which were cut down out of time whose foundation was overflown
with a flood  which said unto god depart from us and what can
the almighty do for them   yet he filled their houses with good
things but the counsel of the wicked is far from me
the righteous see it and are glad and the innocent laugh them
to scorn
whereas our substance is not cut down but the remnant of them
the fire consumeth
acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good
shall come unto thee
receive i pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up his
words in thine heart
if thou return to the almighty thou shalt be built up thou
shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles
then shalt thou lay up gold as dust and the gold of ophir as
the stones of the brooks
yea the almighty shall be thy defence and thou shalt have
plenty of silver
for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty and shalt
lift up thy face unto god
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him and he shall hear thee and
thou shalt pay thy vows
thou shalt also decree a thing and it shall be established unto
thee and the light shall shine upon thy ways
when men are cast down then thou shalt say there is lifting
up and he shall save the humble person
he shall deliver the island of the innocent and it is delivered
by the pureness of thine hands
then job answered and said  even to day is my complaint
bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning
oh that i knew where i might find him that i might come even to
his seat   i would order my cause before him and fill my mouth
with arguments
i would know the words which he would answer me and understand
what he would say unto me
will he plead against me with his great power no but he would
put strength in me
there the righteous might dispute with him so should i be
delivered for ever from my judge
behold i go forward but he is not there and backward but i
cannot perceive him  on the left hand where he doth work but i
cannot behold him he hideth himself on the right hand that i cannot
see him  but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried
me i shall come forth as gold
my foot hath held his steps his way have i kept and not
declined
neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i
have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food
but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul
desireth even that he doeth
for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many
such things are with him
therefore am i troubled at his presence when i consider i am
afraid of him
for god maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me
because i was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he
covered the darkness from my face
why seeing times are not hidden from the almighty do they that
know him not see his days   some remove the landmarks they
violently take away flocks and feed thereof
they drive away the ass of the fatherless they take the widows
ox for a pledge
they turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth hide
themselves together
behold as wild asses in the desert go they forth to their work
rising betimes for a prey the wilderness yieldeth food for them and
for their children
they reap every one his corn in the field and they gather the
vintage of the wicked
they cause the naked to lodge without clothing that they have no
covering in the cold
they are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace the
rock for want of a shelter
they pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge of
the poor
they cause him to go naked without clothing and they take away
the sheaf from the hungry  which make oil within their walls
and tread their winepresses and suffer thirst
men groan from out of the city and the soul of the wounded
crieth out yet god layeth not folly to them
they are of those that rebel against the light they know not
the ways thereof nor abide in the paths thereof
the murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy
and in the night is as a thief
the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight saying
no eye shall see me and disguiseth his face
in the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for
themselves in the daytime they know not the light
for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death if one
know them they are in the terrors of the shadow of death
he is swift as the waters their portion is cursed in the earth
he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards
drought and heat consume the snow waters so doth the grave
those which have sinned
the womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetly on him
he shall be no more remembered and wickedness shall be broken as a
tree
he evil entreateth the barren that beareth not and doeth not
good to the widow
he draweth also the mighty with his power he riseth up and no
man is sure of life
though it be given him to be in safety whereon he resteth yet
his eyes are upon their ways
they are exalted for a little while but are gone and brought
low they are taken out of the way as all other and cut off as the
tops of the ears of corn
and if it be not so now who will make me a liar and make my
speech nothing worth   then answered bildad the shuhite and
said  dominion and fear are with him he maketh peace in his high
places
is there any number of his armies and upon whom doth not his
light arise   how then can man be justified with god or how can
he be clean that is born of a woman   behold even to the moon
and it shineth not yea the stars are not pure in his sight
how much less man that is a worm and the son of man which is a
worm   but job answered and said  how hast thou helped him
that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength
how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom and how hast
thou plentifully declared the thing as it is   to whom hast thou
uttered words and whose spirit came from thee   dead things are
formed from under the waters and the inhabitants thereof
hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering
he stretcheth out the north over the empty place and hangeth the
earth upon nothing
he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud is
not rent under them
he holdeth back the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloud
upon it
he hath compassed the waters with bounds until the day and
night come to an end
the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof
he divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding he
smiteth through the proud
by his spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand hath
formed the crooked serpent
lo these are parts of his ways but how little a portion is
heard of him but the thunder of his power who can understand
moreover job continued his parable and said  as god liveth who
hath taken away my judgment and the almighty who hath vexed my soul
all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of god is in my
nostrils  my lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter
deceit
god forbid that i should justify you till i die i will not
remove mine integrity from me
my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go my heart
shall not reproach me so long as i live
let mine enemy be as the wicked and he that riseth up against me
as the unrighteous
for what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained
when god taketh away his soul   will god hear his cry when
trouble cometh upon him   will he delight himself in the
almighty will he always call upon god   i will teach you by the
hand of god that which is with the almighty will i not conceal
behold all ye yourselves have seen it why then are ye thus
altogether vain   this is the portion of a wicked man with god
and the heritage of oppressors which they shall receive of the
almighty
if his children be multiplied it is for the sword and his
offspring shall not be satisfied with bread
those that remain of him shall be buried in death and his
widows shall not weep
though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the
clay  he may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the
innocent shall divide the silver
he buildeth his house as a moth and as a booth that the keeper
maketh
the rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gathered he
openeth his eyes and he is not
terrors take hold on him as waters a tempest stealeth him away
in the night
the east wind carrieth him away and he departeth and as a
storm hurleth him out of his place
for god shall cast upon him and not spare he would fain flee
out of his hand
men shall clap their hands at him and shall hiss him out of his
place
surely there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold where
they fine it
iron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of the
stone
he setteth an end to darkness and searcheth out all perfection
the stones of darkness and the shadow of death
the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant even the waters
forgotten of the foot they are dried up they are gone away from men
as for the earth out of it cometh bread and under it is turned
up as it were fire
the stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of
gold
there is a path which no fowl knoweth and which the vultures
eye hath not seen  the lions whelps have not trodden it nor the
fierce lion passed by it
he putteth forth his hand upon the rock he overturneth the
mountains by the roots
he cutteth out rivers among the rocks and his eye seeth every
precious thing
he bindeth the floods from overflowing and the thing that is
hid bringeth he forth to light
but where shall wisdom be found and where is the place of
understanding   man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it
found in the land of the living
the depth saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is not
with me
it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighed
for the price thereof
it cannot be valued with the gold of ophir with the precious
onyx or the sapphire
the gold and the crystal cannot equal it and the exchange of it
shall not be for jewels of fine gold
no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls for the price
of wisdom is above rubies
the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be
valued with pure gold
whence then cometh wisdom and where is the place of
understanding   seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living
and kept close from the fowls of the air
destruction and death say we have heard the fame thereof with
our ears
god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place
thereof
for he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under the
whole heaven  to make the weight for the winds and he weigheth
the waters by measure
when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning
of the thunder  then did he see it and declare it he prepared
it yea and searched it out
and unto man he said behold the fear of the lord that is
wisdom and to depart from evil is understanding
moreover job continued his parable and said  oh that i were
as in months past as in the days when god preserved me  when his
candle shined upon my head and when by his light i walked through
darkness  as i was in the days of my youth when the secret of
god was upon my tabernacle  when the almighty was yet with me
when my children were about me  when i washed my steps with
butter and the rock poured me out rivers of oil  when i went out
to the gate through the city when i prepared my seat in the street
the young men saw me and hid themselves and the aged arose and
stood up
the princes refrained talking and laid their hand on their
mouth
the nobles held their peace and their tongue cleaved to the
roof of their mouth
when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw
me it gave witness to me  because i delivered the poor that
cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him
the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and i
caused the widows heart to sing for joy
i put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment was as a
robe and a diadem
i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame
i was a father to the poor and the cause which i knew not i
searched out
and i brake the jaws of the wicked and plucked the spoil out of
his teeth
then i said i shall die in my nest and i shall multiply my
days as the sand
my root was spread out by the waters and the dew lay all night
upon my branch
my glory was fresh in me and my bow was renewed in my hand
unto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence at my
counsel
after my words they spake not again and my speech dropped upon
them
and they waited for me as for the rain and they opened their
mouth wide as for the latter rain
if i laughed on them they believed it not and the light of my
countenance they cast not down
i chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt as a king in the
army as one that comforteth the mourners
but now they that are younger than i have me in derision whose
fathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock
yea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me in whom
old age was perished   for want and famine they were solitary
fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste
who cut up mallows by the bushes and juniper roots for their
meat
they were driven forth from among men they cried after them as
after a thief  to dwell in the cliffs of the valleys in caves
of the earth and in the rocks
among the bushes they brayed under the nettles they were
gathered together
they were children of fools yea children of base men they were
viler than the earth
and now am i their song yea i am their byword
they abhor me they flee far from me and spare not to spit in
my face
because he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me they have also
let loose the bridle before me
upon my right hand rise the youth they push away my feet and
they raise up against me the ways of their destruction
they mar my path they set forward my calamity they have no
helper
they came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters in the
desolation they rolled themselves upon me
terrors are turned upon me they pursue my soul as the wind and
my welfare passeth away as a cloud
and now my soul is poured out upon me the days of affliction
have taken hold upon me
my bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinews
take no rest
by the great force of my disease is my garment changed it
bindeth me about as the collar of my coat
he hath cast me into the mire and i am become like dust and
ashes
i cry unto thee and thou dost not hear me i stand up and thou
regardest me not
thou art become cruel to me with thy strong hand thou opposest
thyself against me
thou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride upon it
and dissolvest my substance
for i know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the house
appointed for all living
howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave though
they cry in his destruction
did not i weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul
grieved for the poor   when i looked for good then evil came
unto me and when i waited for light there came darkness
my bowels boiled and rested not the days of affliction
prevented me
i went mourning without the sun i stood up and i cried in the
congregation
i am a brother to dragons and a companion to owls
my skin is black upon me and my bones are burned with heat
my harp also is turned to mourning and my organ into the voice
of them that weep
i made a covenant with mine eyes why then should i think upon a
maid   for what portion of god is there from above and what
inheritance of the almighty from on high   is not destruction to
the wicked and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity
doth not he see my ways and count all my steps   if i have
walked with vanity or if my foot hath hasted to deceit  let me
be weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity
if my step hath turned out of the way and mine heart walked
after mine eyes and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands  then
let me sow and let another eat yea let my offspring be rooted out
if mine heart have been deceived by a woman or if i have laid
wait at my neighbours door  then let my wife grind unto
another and let others bow down upon her
for this is an heinous crime yea it is an iniquity to be
punished by the judges
for it is a fire that consumeth to destruction and would root
out all mine increase
if i did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
maidservant when they contended with me  what then shall i do
when god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall i answer him
did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one
fashion us in the womb   if i have withheld the poor from their
desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail  or have
eaten my morsel myself alone and the fatherless hath not eaten
thereof  for from my youth he was brought up with me as with a
father and i have guided her from my mothers womb  if i have
seen any perish for want of clothing or any poor without covering
if his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with
the fleece of my sheep  if i have lifted up my hand against the
fatherless when i saw my help in the gate  then let mine arm
fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone
for destruction from god was a terror to me and by reason of
his highness i could not endure
if i have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold thou
art my confidence  if i rejoice because my wealth was great and
because mine hand had gotten much  if i beheld the sun when it
shined or the moon walking in brightness  and my heart hath
been secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand  this
also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge for i should have
denied the god that is above
if i rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me or lifted
up myself when evil found him  neither have i suffered my mouth
to sin by wishing a curse to his soul
if the men of my tabernacle said not oh that we had of his
flesh  we cannot be satisfied
the stranger did not lodge in the street but i opened my doors
to the traveller
if i covered my transgressions as adam by hiding mine iniquity
in my bosom  did i fear a great multitude or did the contempt
of families terrify me that i kept silence and went not out of the
door   oh that one would hear me behold my desire is that the
almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book
surely i would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crown
to me
i would declare unto him the number of my steps as a prince
would i go near unto him
if my land cry against me or that the furrows likewise thereof
complain  if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money or
have caused the owners thereof to lose their life  let thistles
grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley
the words of job are ended
so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous
in his own eyes
then was kindled the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the
buzite of the kindred of ram against job was his wrath kindled
because he justified himself rather than god
also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because
they had found no answer and yet had condemned job
now elihu had waited till job had spoken because they were elder
than he
when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
three men then his wrath was kindled
and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said i am
young and ye are very old wherefore i was afraid and durst not shew
you mine opinion
i said days should speak and multitude of years should teach
wisdom
but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty
giveth them understanding
great men are not always wise neither do the aged understand
judgment
therefore i said hearken to me i also will shew mine opinion
behold i waited for your words i gave ear to your reasons
whilst ye searched out what to say
yea i attended unto you and behold there was none of you
that convinced job or that answered his words  lest ye should
say we have found out wisdom god thrusteth him down not man
now he hath not directed his words against me neither will i
answer him with your speeches
they were amazed they answered no more they left off speaking
when i had waited for they spake not but stood still and
answered no more  i said i will answer also my part i also
will shew mine opinion
for i am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me
behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent it is ready to
burst like new bottles
i will speak that i may be refreshed i will open my lips and
answer
let me not i pray you accept any mans person neither let me
give flattering titles unto man
for i know not to give flattering titles in so doing my maker
would soon take me away
wherefore job i pray thee hear my speeches and hearken to all
my words
behold now i have opened my mouth my tongue hath spoken in my
mouth
my words shall be of the uprightness of my heart and my lips
shall utter knowledge clearly
the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almighty
hath given me life
if thou canst answer me set thy words in order before me stand
up
behold i am according to thy wish in gods stead i also am
formed out of the clay
behold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall my
hand be heavy upon thee
surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing and i have heard the
voice of thy words saying  i am clean without transgression i
am innocent neither is there iniquity in me
behold he findeth occasions against me he counteth me for his
enemy  he putteth my feet in the stocks he marketh all my
paths
behold in this thou art not just i will answer thee that god
is greater than man
why dost thou strive against him for he giveth not account of
any of his matters
for god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth it not
in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth
upon men in slumberings upon the bed  then he openeth the ears
of men and sealeth their instruction  that he may withdraw man
from his purpose and hide pride from man
he keepeth back his soul from the pit and his life from
perishing by the sword
he is chastened also with pain upon his bed and the multitude
of his bones with strong pain  so that his life abhorreth bread
and his soul dainty meat
his flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen and his
bones that were not seen stick out
yea his soul draweth near unto the grave and his life to the
destroyers
if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a
thousand to shew unto man his uprightness  then he is gracious
unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i have
found a ransom
his flesh shall be fresher than a childs he shall return to
the days of his youth  he shall pray unto god and he will be
favourable unto him and he shall see his face with joy for he will
render unto man his righteousness
he looketh upon men and if any say i have sinned and
perverted that which was right and it profited me not  he will
deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the
light
lo all these things worketh god oftentimes with man  to
bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of
the living
mark well o job hearken unto me hold thy peace and i will
speak
if thou hast anything to say answer me speak for i desire to
justify thee
if not hearken unto me hold thy peace and i shall teach thee
wisdom
furthermore elihu answered and said  hear my words o ye
wise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledge
for the ear trieth words as the mouth tasteth meat
let us choose to us judgment let us know among ourselves what is
good
for job hath said i am righteous and god hath taken away my
judgment
should i lie against my right my wound is incurable without
transgression
what man is like job who drinketh up scorning like water
which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity and walketh with
wicked men
for he hath said it profiteth a man nothing that he should
delight himself with god
therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding far be it
from god that he should do wickedness and from the almighty that he
should commit iniquity
for the work of a man shall he render unto him and cause every
man to find according to his ways
yea surely god will not do wickedly neither will the almighty
pervert judgment
who hath given him a charge over the earth or who hath disposed
the whole world   if he set his heart upon man if he gather
unto himself his spirit and his breath  all flesh shall perish
together and man shall turn again unto dust
if now thou hast understanding hear this hearken to the voice
of my words
shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn
him that is most just   is it fit to say to a king thou art
wicked and to princes ye are ungodly   how much less to him
that accepteth not the persons of princes nor regardeth the rich more
than the poor for they all are the work of his hands
in a moment shall they die and the people shall be troubled at
midnight and pass away and the mighty shall be taken away without
hand
for his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all his
goings
there is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of
iniquity may hide themselves
for he will not lay upon man more than right that he should
enter into judgment with god
he shall break in pieces mighty men without number and set
others in their stead
therefore he knoweth their works and he overturneth them in the
night so that they are destroyed
he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others
because they turned back from him and would not consider any of
his ways  so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto
him and he heareth the cry of the afflicted
when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble and when he
hideth his face who then can behold him whether it be done against a
nation or against a man only  that the hypocrite reign not
lest the people be ensnared
surely it is meet to be said unto god i have borne
chastisement i will not offend any more  that which i see not
teach thou me if i have done iniquity i will do no more
should it be according to thy mind he will recompense it
whether thou refuse or whether thou choose and not i therefore
speak what thou knowest
let men of understanding tell me and let a wise man hearken
unto me
job hath spoken without knowledge and his words were without
wisdom
my desire is that job may be tried unto the end because of his
answers for wicked men
for he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hands
among us and multiplieth his words against god
elihu spake moreover and said  thinkest thou this to be
right that thou saidst my righteousness is more than gods
for thou saidst what advantage will it be unto thee and what profit
shall i have if i be cleansed from my sin   i will answer thee
and thy companions with thee
look unto the heavens and see and behold the clouds which are
higher than thou
if thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thy
transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him   if thou
be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine
hand   thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and thy
righteousness may profit the son of man
by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed
to cry they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty
but none saith where is god my maker who giveth songs in the
night  who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth and
maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven   there they cry but
none giveth answer because of the pride of evil men
surely god will not hear vanity neither will the almighty
regard it
although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is
before him therefore trust thou in him
but now because it is not so he hath visited in his anger yet
he knoweth it not in great extremity  therefore doth job open
his mouth in vain he multiplieth words without knowledge
elihu also proceeded and said  suffer me a little and i
will shew thee that i have yet to speak on gods behalf
i will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascribe
righteousness to my maker
for truly my words shall not be false he that is perfect in
knowledge is with thee
behold god is mighty and despiseth not any he is mighty in
strength and wisdom
he preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth right to the
poor
he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous but with kings
are they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and they
are exalted
and if they be bound in fetters and be holden in cords of
affliction  then he sheweth them their work and their
transgressions that they have exceeded
he openeth also their ear to discipline and commandeth that
they return from iniquity
if they obey and serve him they shall spend their days in
prosperity and their years in pleasures
but if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and they
shall die without knowledge
but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath they cry not when he
bindeth them
they die in youth and their life is among the unclean
he delivereth the poor in his affliction and openeth their ears
in oppression
even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a
broad place where there is no straitness and that which should be
set on thy table should be full of fatness
but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked judgment and
justice take hold on thee
because there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with his
stroke then a great ransom cannot deliver thee
will he esteem thy riches no not gold nor all the forces of
strength
desire not the night when people are cut off in their place
take heed regard not iniquity for this hast thou chosen rather
than affliction
behold god exalteth by his power who teacheth like him
who hath enjoined him his way or who can say thou hast wrought
iniquity   remember that thou magnify his work which men
behold
every man may see it man may behold it afar off
behold god is great and we know him not neither can the
number of his years be searched out
for he maketh small the drops of water they pour down rain
according to the vapour thereof  which the clouds do drop and
distil upon man abundantly
also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds or the
noise of his tabernacle   behold he spreadeth his light upon
it and covereth the bottom of the sea
for by them judgeth he the people he giveth meat in abundance
with clouds he covereth the light and commandeth it not to
shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt
the noise thereof sheweth concerning it the cattle also
concerning the vapour
at this also my heart trembleth and is moved out of his place
hear attentively the noise of his voice and the sound that goeth
out of his mouth
he directeth it under the whole heaven and his lightning unto
the ends of the earth
after it a voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of his
excellency and he will not stay them when his voice is heard
god thundereth marvellously with his voice great things doeth
he which we cannot comprehend
for he saith to the snow be thou on the earth likewise to the
small rain and to the great rain of his strength
he sealeth up the hand of every man that all men may know his
work
then the beasts go into dens and remain in their places
out of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the north
by the breath of god frost is given and the breadth of the
waters is straitened
also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud he scattereth his
bright cloud  and it is turned round about by his counsels that
they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world
in the earth
he causeth it to come whether for correction or for his land
or for mercy
hearken unto this o job stand still and consider the wondrous
works of god
dost thou know when god disposed them and caused the light of
his cloud to shine   dost thou know the balancings of the
clouds the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge
how thy garments are warm when he quieteth the earth by the
south wind   hast thou with him spread out the sky which is
strong and as a molten looking glass   teach us what we shall
say unto him for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness
shall it be told him that i speak if a man speak surely he
shall be swallowed up
and now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds but
the wind passeth and cleanseth them
fair weather cometh out of the north with god is terrible
majesty
touching the almighty we cannot find him out he is excellent
in power and in judgment and in plenty of justice he will not
afflict
men do therefore fear him he respecteth not any that are wise
of heart
then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said
who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge
gird up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and
answer thou me
where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth
declare if thou hast understanding
who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath
stretched the line upon it   whereupon are the foundations
thereof fastened or who laid the corner stone thereof  when the
morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy
or who shut up the sea with doors when it brake forth as if it
had issued out of the womb   when i made the cloud the garment
thereof and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it  and brake up
for it my decreed place and set bars and doors  and said
hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud
waves be stayed   hast thou commanded the morning since thy
days and caused the dayspring to know his place  that it might
take hold of the ends of the earth that the wicked might be shaken
out of it   it is turned as clay to the seal and they stand as
a garment
and from the wicked their light is withholden and the high arm
shall be broken
hast thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thou
walked in the search of the depth   have the gates of death been
opened unto thee or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death
hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth declare if thou
knowest it all
where is the way where light dwelleth and as for darkness
where is the place thereof  that thou shouldest take it to the
bound thereof and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house
thereof   knowest thou it because thou wast then born or
because the number of thy days is great   hast thou entered into
the treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the
hail  which i have reserved against the time of trouble against
the day of battle and war   by what way is the light parted
which scattereth the east wind upon the earth   who hath divided
a watercourse for the overflowing of waters or a way for the
lightning of thunder  to cause it to rain on the earth where no
man is on the wilderness wherein there is no man  to satisfy
the desolate and waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herb
to spring forth   hath the rain a father or who hath begotten
the drops of dew   out of whose womb came the ice and the hoary
frost of heaven who hath gendered it   the waters are hid as
with a stone and the face of the deep is frozen
canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades or loose the
bands of orion   canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in his season
or canst thou guide arcturus with his sons   knowest thou the
ordinances of heaven canst thou set the dominion thereof in the
earth   canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that
abundance of waters may cover thee   canst thou send lightnings
that they may go and say unto thee here we are   who hath put
wisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to the
heart   who can number the clouds in wisdom or who can stay the
bottles of heaven  when the dust groweth into hardness and the
clods cleave fast together   wilt thou hunt the prey for the
lion or fill the appetite of the young lions  when they couch
in their dens and abide in the covert to lie in wait   who
provideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto god
they wander for lack of meat
knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring
forth or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve   canst thou
number the months that they fulfil or knowest thou the time when they
bring forth   they bow themselves they bring forth their young
ones they cast out their sorrows
their young ones are in good liking they grow up with corn they
go forth and return not unto them
who hath sent out the wild ass free or who hath loosed the bands
of the wild ass   whose house i have made the wilderness and the
barren land his dwellings
he scorneth the multitude of the city neither regardeth he the
crying of the driver
the range of the mountains is his pasture and he searcheth after
every green thing
will the unicorn be willing to serve thee or abide by thy crib
canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow or will
he harrow the valleys after thee   wilt thou trust him because
his strength is great or wilt thou leave thy labour to him
wilt thou believe him that he will bring home thy seed and gather it
into thy barn   gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks
or wings and feathers unto the ostrich   which leaveth her eggs
in the earth and warmeth them in dust  and forgetteth that the
foot may crush them or that the wild beast may break them
she is hardened against her young ones as though they were not
hers her labour is in vain without fear  because god hath
deprived her of wisdom neither hath he imparted to her understanding
what time she lifteth up herself on high she scorneth the horse
and his rider
hast thou given the horse strength hast thou clothed his neck
with thunder   canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper the
glory of his nostrils is terrible
he paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength he goeth
on to meet the armed men
he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted neither turneth he
back from the sword
the quiver rattleth against him the glittering spear and the
shield
he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage neither
believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet
he saith among the trumpets ha ha and he smelleth the battle
afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting
doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom and stretch her wings toward
the south   doth the eagle mount up at thy command and make her
nest on high   she dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the
crag of the rock and the strong place
from thence she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold afar off
her young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are
there is she
moreover the lord answered job and said  shall he that
contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth god let
him answer it
then job answered the lord and said  behold i am vile
what shall i answer thee i will lay mine hand upon my mouth
once have i spoken but i will not answer yea twice but i will
proceed no further
then answered the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said
gird up thy loins now like a man i will demand of thee and
declare thou unto me
wilt thou also disannul my judgment wilt thou condemn me that
thou mayest be righteous   hast thou an arm like god or canst
thou thunder with a voice like him   deck thyself now with
majesty and excellency and array thyself with glory and beauty
cast abroad the rage of thy wrath and behold every one that is
proud and abase him
look on every one that is proud and bring him low and tread
down the wicked in their place
hide them in the dust together and bind their faces in secret
then will i also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can
save thee
behold now behemoth which i made with thee he eateth grass as
an ox
lo now his strength is in his loins and his force is in the
navel of his belly
he moveth his tail like a cedar the sinews of his stones are
wrapped together
his bones are as strong pieces of brass his bones are like bars
of iron
he is the chief of the ways of god he that made him can make
his sword to approach unto him
surely the mountains bring him forth food where all the beasts
of the field play
he lieth under the shady trees in the covert of the reed and
fens
the shady trees cover him with their shadow the willows of the
brook compass him about
behold he drinketh up a river and hasteth not he trusteth
that he can draw up jordan into his mouth
he taketh it with his eyes his nose pierceth through snares
canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook or his tongue with a
cord which thou lettest down   canst thou put an hook into his
nose or bore his jaw through with a thorn   will he make many
supplications unto thee will he speak soft words unto thee
will he make a covenant with thee wilt thou take him for a servant
for ever   wilt thou play with him as with a bird or wilt thou
bind him for thy maidens   shall the companions make a banquet of
him shall they part him among the merchants   canst thou fill
his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears   lay
thine hand upon him remember the battle do no more
behold the hope of him is in vain shall not one be cast down
even at the sight of him   none is so fierce that dare stir him
up who then is able to stand before me   who hath prevented me
that i should repay him whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine
i will not conceal his parts nor his power nor his comely
proportion
who can discover the face of his garment or who can come to him
with his double bridle   who can open the doors of his face his
teeth are terrible round about
his scales are his pride shut up together as with a close seal
one is so near to another that no air can come between them
they are joined one to another they stick together that they
cannot be sundered
by his neesings a light doth shine and his eyes are like the
eyelids of the morning
out of his mouth go burning lamps and sparks of fire leap out
out of his nostrils goeth smoke as out of a seething pot or
caldron
his breath kindleth coals and a flame goeth out of his mouth
in his neck remaineth strength and sorrow is turned into joy
before him
the flakes of his flesh are joined together they are firm in
themselves they cannot be moved
his heart is as firm as a stone yea as hard as a piece of the
nether millstone
when he raiseth up himself the mighty are afraid by reason of
breakings they purify themselves
the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the
dart nor the habergeon
he esteemeth iron as straw and brass as rotten wood
the arrow cannot make him flee slingstones are turned with him
into stubble
darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a
spear
sharp stones are under him he spreadeth sharp pointed things
upon the mire
he maketh the deep to boil like a pot he maketh the sea like a
pot of ointment
he maketh a path to shine after him one would think the deep to
be hoary
upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear
he beholdeth all high things he is a king over all the children
of pride
then job answered the lord and said  i know that thou canst
do every thing and that no thought can be withholden from thee
who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have i
uttered that i understood not things too wonderful for me which i
knew not
hear i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of thee
and declare thou unto me
i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye
seeth thee
wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes
and it was so that after the lord had spoken these words unto
job the lord said to eliphaz the temanite my wrath is kindled
against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of
me the thing that is right as my servant job hath
therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams and go
to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and
my servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept lest i deal
with you after your folly in that ye have not spoken of me the thing
which is right like my servant job
so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the
naamathite went and did according as the lord commanded them the
lord also accepted job
and the lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his
friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before
then came there unto him all his brethren and all his sisters
and all they that had been of his acquaintance before and did eat
bread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him
over all the evil that the lord had brought upon him every man also
gave him a piece of money and every one an earring of gold
so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his
beginning for he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand
camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she asses
he had also seven sons and three daughters
and he called the name of the first jemima and the name of the
second kezia and the name of the third kerenhappuch
and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters
of job and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren
after this lived job an hundred and forty years and saw his
sons and his sons sons even four generations
so job died being old and full of days
the book of psalms
blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly
nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
scornful
but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he
meditate day and night
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that
bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not
wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind
driveth away
therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners
in the congregation of the righteous
for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the
ungodly shall perish
why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing
the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel
together against the lord and against his anointed saying
let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from
us
he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall have
them in derision
then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his
sore displeasure
yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion
i will declare the decree the lord hath said unto me thou art my
son this day have i begotten thee
ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine
inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession
thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in
pieces like a potters vessel
be wise now therefore o ye kings be instructed ye judges of
the earth
serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling
kiss the son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when
his wrath is kindled but a little blessed are all they that put their
trust in him
lord how are they increased that trouble me many are they that
rise up against me
many there be which say of my soul there is no help for him in
god
selah
but thou o lord art a shield for me my glory and the lifter up
of mine head
i cried unto the lord with my voice and he heard me out of his
holy hill selah
i laid me down and slept i awaked for the lord sustained me
i will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set
themselves against me round about
arise o lord save me o my god for thou hast smitten all mine
enemies upon the cheek bone thou hast broken the teeth of the
ungodly
salvation belongeth unto the lord thy blessing is upon thy
people
selah
hear me when i call o god of my righteousness thou hast enlarged
me when i was in distress have mercy upon me and hear my prayer
o ye sons of men how long will ye turn my glory into shame how
long will ye love vanity and seek after leasing selah
but know that the lord hath set apart him that is godly for
himself the lord will hear when i call unto him
stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your
bed and be still selah
offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the
lord
there be many that say who will shew us any good lord lift thou
up the light of thy countenance upon us
thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that
their corn and their wine increased
i will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou lord only
makest me dwell in safety
give ear to my words o lord consider my meditation
hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my god for unto
thee will i pray
my voice shalt thou hear in the morning o lord in the morning
will i direct my prayer unto thee and will look up
for thou art not a god that hath pleasure in wickedness neither
shall evil dwell with thee
the foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers
of iniquity
thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing the lord will abhor
the bloody and deceitful man
but as for me i will come into thy house in the multitude of thy
mercy and in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple
lead me o lord in thy righteousness because of mine enemies
make thy way straight before my face
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth their inward part is
very wickedness their throat is an open sepulchre they flatter with
their tongue
destroy thou them o god let them fall by their own counsels
cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions for they have
rebelled against thee
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice let them
ever shout for joy because thou defendest them let them also that
love thy name be joyful in thee
for thou lord wilt bless the righteous with favour wilt thou
compass him as with a shield
o lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy
hot displeasure
have mercy upon me o lord for i am weak o lord heal me for my
bones are vexed
my soul is also sore vexed but thou o lord how long
return o lord deliver my soul oh save me for thy mercies sake
for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who
shall give thee thanks
i am weary with my groaning all the night make i my bed to swim
i water my couch with my tears
mine eye is consumed because of grief it waxeth old because of
all mine enemies
depart from me all ye workers of iniquity for the lord hath
heard the voice of my weeping
the lord hath heard my supplication the lord will receive my
prayer
let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed let them return
and be ashamed suddenly
o lord my god in thee do i put my trust save me from all them
that persecute me and deliver me
lest he tear my soul like a lion rending it in pieces while
there is none to deliver
o lord my god if i have done this if there be iniquity in my
hands
if i have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me yea
i have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy
let the enemy persecute my soul and take it yea let him tread
down my life upon the earth and lay mine honour in the dust selah
arise o lord in thine anger lift up thyself because of the rage
of mine enemies and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast
commanded
so shall the congregation of the people compass thee about for
their sakes therefore return thou on high
the lord shall judge the people judge me o lord according to my
righteousness and according to mine integrity that is in me
oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end but establish
the just for the righteous god trieth the hearts and reins
my defence is of god which saveth the upright in heart
god judgeth the righteous and god is angry with the wicked every
day
if he turn not he will whet his sword he hath bent his bow and
made it ready
he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death he
ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors
behold he travaileth with iniquity and hath conceived mischief
and brought forth falsehood
he made a pit and digged it and is fallen into the ditch which
he made
his mischief shall return upon his own head and his violent
dealing shall come down upon his own pate
i will praise the lord according to his righteousness and will
sing praise to the name of the lord most high
o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth who
hast set thy glory above the heavens
out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest still the enemy
and the avenger
when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and
the stars which thou hast ordained
what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man
that thou visitest him
for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast
crowned him with glory and honour
thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou
hast put all things under his feet
all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the field
the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever
passeth through the paths of the seas
o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth
i will praise thee o lord with my whole heart i will shew forth
all thy marvellous works
i will be glad and rejoice in thee i will sing praise to thy
name o thou most high
when mine enemies are turned back they shall fall and perish at
thy presence
for thou hast maintained my right and my cause thou satest in the
throne judging right
thou hast rebuked the heathen thou hast destroyed the wicked
thou hast put out their name for ever and ever
o thou enemy destructions are come to a perpetual end and thou
hast destroyed cities their memorial is perished with them
but the lord shall endure for ever he hath prepared his throne
for judgment
and he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall minister
judgment to the people in uprightness
the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in
times of trouble
and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee for
thou lord hast not forsaken them that seek thee
sing praises to the lord which dwelleth in zion declare among
the people his doings
when he maketh inquisition for blood he remembereth them he
forgetteth not the cry of the humble
have mercy upon me o lord consider my trouble which i suffer of
them that hate me thou that liftest me up from the gates of death
that i may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter
of zion i will rejoice in thy salvation
the heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made in the net
which they hid is their own foot taken
the lord is known by the judgment which he executeth the wicked
is snared in the work of his own hands higgaion selah
the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that
forget god
for the needy shall not alway be forgotten the expectation of
the poor shall not perish for ever
arise o lord let not man prevail let the heathen be judged in
thy sight
put them in fear o lord that the nations may know themselves to
be but men selah
why standest thou afar off o lord why hidest thou thyself in
times of trouble
the wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor let them be
taken in the devices that they have imagined
for the wicked boasteth of his hearts desire and blesseth the
covetous whom the lord abhorreth
the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek
after god god is not in all his thoughts
his ways are always grievous thy judgments are far above out of
his sight as for all his enemies he puffeth at them
he hath said in his heart i shall not be moved for i shall
never be in adversity
his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud under his
tongue is mischief and vanity
he sitteth in the lurking places of the villages in the secret
places doth he murder the innocent his eyes are privily set against
the poor
he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den he lieth in wait
to catch the poor he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into
his net
he croucheth and humbleth himself that the poor may fall by
his strong ones
he hath said in his heart god hath forgotten he hideth his
face he will never see it
arise o lord o god lift up thine hand forget not the humble
wherefore doth the wicked contemn god he hath said in his
heart thou wilt not require it
thou hast seen it for thou beholdest mischief and spite to
requite it with thy hand the poor committeth himself unto thee thou
art the helper of the fatherless
break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man seek out his
wickedness till thou find none
the lord is king for ever and ever the heathen are perished out
of his land
lord thou hast heard the desire of the humble thou wilt
prepare their heart thou wilt cause thine ear to hear
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed that the man of the
earth may no more oppress
in the lord put i my trust how say ye to my soul flee as a bird
to your mountain
for lo the wicked bend their bow they make ready their arrow
upon the string that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart
if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do
the lord is in his holy temple the lords throne is in heaven
his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men
the lord trieth the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth
violence his soul hateth
upon the wicked he shall rain snares fire and brimstone and an
horrible tempest this shall be the portion of their cup
for the righteous lord loveth righteousness his countenance doth
behold the upright
help lord for the godly man ceaseth for the faithful fail from
among the children of men
they speak vanity every one with his neighbour with flattering
lips and with a double heart do they speak
the lord shall cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that
speaketh proud things
who have said with our tongue will we prevail our lips are our
own who is lord over us
for the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy now
will i arise saith the lord i will set him in safety from him that
puffeth at him
the words of the lord are pure words as silver tried in a
furnace of earth purified seven times
thou shalt keep them o lord thou shalt preserve them from this
generation for ever
the wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted
how long wilt thou forget me o lord for ever how long wilt
thou hide thy face from me
how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my
heart daily how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me
consider and hear me o lord my god lighten mine eyes lest i
sleep the sleep of death
lest mine enemy say i have prevailed against him and those that
trouble me rejoice when i am moved
but i have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy
salvation
i will sing unto the lord because he hath dealt bountifully with
me
the fool hath said in his heart there is no god they are
corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth
good
the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see
if there were any that did understand and seek god
they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy
there is none that doeth good no not one
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my
people as they eat bread and call not upon the lord
there were they in great fear for god is in the generation of
the righteous
ye have shamed the counsel of the poor because the lord is his
refuge
oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when the
lord bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice
and israel shall be glad
lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy
holy hill
he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and
speaketh the truth in his heart
he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his
neighbour nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour
in whose eyes a vile person is contemned but he honoureth them
that fear the lord he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth
not
he that putteth not out his money to usury nor taketh reward
against the innocent he that doeth these things shall never be moved
preserve me o god for in thee do i put my trust
o my soul thou hast said unto the lord thou art my lord my
goodness extendeth not to thee
but to the saints that are in the earth and to the excellent in
whom is all my delight
their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god
their drink offerings of blood will i not offer nor take up their
names into my lips
the lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou
maintainest my lot
the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places yea i have a
goodly heritage
i will bless the lord who hath given me counsel my reins also
instruct me in the night seasons
i have set the lord always before me because he is at my right
hand i shall not be moved
therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth my flesh also
shall rest in hope
for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou
suffer thine holy one to see corruption
thou wilt shew me the path of life in thy presence is fulness
of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore
hear the right o lord attend unto my cry give ear unto my
prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips
let my sentence come forth from thy presence let thine eyes
behold the things that are equal
thou hast proved mine heart thou hast visited me in the night
thou hast tried me and shalt find nothing i am purposed that my
mouth shall not transgress
concerning the works of men by the word of thy lips i have kept
me from the paths of the destroyer
hold up my goings in thy paths that my footsteps slip not
i have called upon thee for thou wilt hear me o god incline
thine ear unto me and hear my speech
shew thy marvellous lovingkindness o thou that savest by thy
right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up
against them
keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy
wings
from the wicked that oppress me from my deadly enemies who
compass me about
they are inclosed in their own fat with their mouth they speak
proudly
they have now compassed us in our steps they have set their
eyes bowing down to the earth
like as a lion that is greedy of his prey and as it were a
young lion lurking in secret places
arise o lord disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul
from the wicked which is thy sword
from men which are thy hand o lord from men of the world
which have their portion in this life and whose belly thou fillest
with thy hid treasure they are full of children and leave the rest
of their substance to their babes
as for me i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be
satisfied when i awake with thy likeness
i will love thee o lord my strength
the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god
my strength in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my
salvation and my high tower
i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall
i be saved from mine enemies
the sorrows of death compassed me and the floods of ungodly men
made me afraid
the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death
prevented me
in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god he
heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even
into his ears
then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the
hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his
mouth devoured coals were kindled by it
he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under
his feet
and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he did fly upon the
wings of the wind
he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him
were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies
at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed
hail stones and coals of fire
the lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his
voice hail stones and coals of fire
yea he sent out his arrows and scattered them and he shot out
lightnings and discomfited them
then the channels of waters were seen and the foundations of
the world were discovered at thy rebuke o lord at the blast of the
breath of thy nostrils
he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters
he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated
me for they were too strong for me
they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my
stay
he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me
because he delighted in me
the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to
the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me
for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly
departed from my god
for all his judgments were before me and i did not put away his
statutes from me
i was also upright before him and i kept myself from mine
iniquity
therefore hath the lord recompensed me according to my
righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful with an
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward
thou wilt shew thyself froward
for thou wilt save the afflicted people but wilt bring down
high looks
for thou wilt light my candle the lord my god will enlighten my
darkness
for by thee i have run through a troop and by my god have i
leaped over a wall
as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried
he is a buckler to all those that trust in him
for who is god save the lord or who is a rock save our god
it is god that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way
perfect
he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high
places
he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by
mine arms
thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy
right hand hath holden me up and thy gentleness hath made me great
thou hast enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip
i have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them neither did i
turn again till they were consumed
i have wounded them that they were not able to rise they are
fallen under my feet
for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle thou hast
subdued under me those that rose up against me
thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might
destroy them that hate me
they cried but there was none to save them even unto the lord
but he answered them not
then did i beat them small as the dust before the wind i did
cast them out as the dirt in the streets
thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people and
thou hast made me the head of the heathen a people whom i have not
known shall serve me
as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me the strangers
shall submit themselves unto me
the strangers shall fade away and be afraid out of their close
places
the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and let the god of my
salvation be exalted
it is god that avengeth me and subdueth the people under me
he delivereth me from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up
above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the
violent man
therefore will i give thanks unto thee o lord among the
heathen and sing praises unto thy name
great deliverance giveth he to his king and sheweth mercy to
his anointed to david and to his seed for evermore
the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth
his handywork
day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night sheweth
knowledge
there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard
their line is gone out through all the earth and their words to
the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth
as a strong man to run a race
his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit
unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof
the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the
testimony of the lord is sure making wise the simple
the statutes of the lord are right rejoicing the heart the
commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes
the fear of the lord is clean enduring for ever the judgments
of the lord are true and righteous altogether
more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold
sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb
moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them
there is great reward
who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from secret
faults
keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not
have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be
innocent from the great transgression
let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be
acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer
the lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of
jacob defend thee
send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of
zion
remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice
selah
grant thee according to thine own heart and fulfil all thy
counsel
we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our god we
will set up our banners the lord fulfil all thy petitions
now know i that the lord saveth his anointed he will hear him
from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand
some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember
the name of the lord our god
they are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand
upright
save lord let the king hear us when we call
the king shall joy in thy strength o lord and in thy salvation
how greatly shall he rejoice
thou hast given him his hearts desire and hast not withholden
the request of his lips selah
for thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness thou
settest a crown of pure gold on his head
he asked life of thee and thou gavest it him even length of
days for ever and ever
his glory is great in thy salvation honour and majesty hast thou
laid upon him
for thou hast made him most blessed for ever thou hast made him
exceeding glad with thy countenance
for the king trusteth in the lord and through the mercy of the
most high he shall not be moved
thine hand shall find out all thine enemies thy right hand shall
find out those that hate thee
thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger
the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devour
them
their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed
from among the children of men
for they intended evil against thee they imagined a mischievous
device which they are not able to perform
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt
make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them
be thou exalted lord in thine own strength so will we sing
and praise thy power
my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far
from helping me and from the words of my roaring
o my god i cry in the day time but thou hearest not and in the
night season and am not silent
but thou art holy o thou that inhabitest the praises of israel
our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver
them
they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee
and were not confounded
but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of
the people
all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip
they shake the head saying
he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver
him seeing he delighted in him
but thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me
hope when i was upon my mothers breasts
i was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my god from my
mothers belly
be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to
help
many bulls have compassed me strong bulls of bashan have beset
me round
they gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a
roaring lion
i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint
my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels
my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth
to my jaws and thou hast brought me into the dust of death
for dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have
inclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet
i may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me
they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture
but be not thou far from me o lord o my strength haste thee
to help me
deliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the
dog
save me from the lions mouth for thou hast heard me from the
horns of the unicorns
i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the
congregation will i praise thee
ye that fear the lord praise him all ye the seed of jacob
glorify him and fear him all ye the seed of israel
for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
afflicted neither hath he hid his face from him but when he cried
unto him he heard
my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation i will pay
my vows before them that fear him
the meek shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise the lord
that seek him your heart shall live for ever
all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord
and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee
for the kingdom is the lords and he is the governor among the
nations
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship all they
that go down to the dust shall bow before him and none can keep alive
his own soul
a seed shall serve him it shall be accounted to the lord for a
generation
they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a
people that shall be born that he hath done this
the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside
the still waters
he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
for his names sake
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i
will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they
comfort me
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies
thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
life and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever
the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof the world and
they that dwell therein
for he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the
floods
who shall ascend into the hill of the lord or who shall stand in
his holy place
he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted
up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully
he shall receive the blessing from the lord and righteousness
from the god of his salvation
this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face
o jacob selah
lift up your heads o ye gates and be ye lift up ye everlasting
doors and the king of glory shall come in
who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord
mighty in battle
lift up your heads o ye gates even lift them up ye everlasting
doors and the king of glory shall come in
who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of
glory selah
unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul
o my god i trust in thee let me not be ashamed let not mine
enemies triumph over me
yea let none that wait on thee be ashamed let them be ashamed
which transgress without cause
shew me thy ways o lord teach me thy paths
lead me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my
salvation on thee do i wait all the day
remember o lord thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses
for they have been ever of old
remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions
according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake o
lord
good and upright is the lord therefore will he teach sinners in
the way
the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach
his way
all the paths of the lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep
his covenant and his testimonies
for thy names sake o lord pardon mine iniquity for it is
great
what man is he that feareth the lord him shall he teach in the
way that he shall choose
his soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the
earth
the secret of the lord is with them that fear him and he will
shew them his covenant
mine eyes are ever toward the lord for he shall pluck my feet
out of the net
turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me for i am desolate and
afflicted
the troubles of my heart are enlarged o bring thou me out of my
distresses
look upon mine affliction and my pain and forgive all my sins
consider mine enemies for they are many and they hate me with
cruel hatred
o keep my soul and deliver me let me not be ashamed for i put
my trust in thee
let integrity and uprightness preserve me for i wait on thee
redeem israel o god out of all his troubles
judge me o lord for i have walked in mine integrity i have
trusted also in the lord therefore i shall not slide
examine me o lord and prove me try my reins and my heart
for thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes and i have walked in
thy truth
i have not sat with vain persons neither will i go in with
dissemblers
i have hated the congregation of evil doers and will not sit
with the wicked
i will wash mine hands in innocency so will i compass thine
altar o lord
that i may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of
all thy wondrous works
lord i have loved the habitation of thy house and the place
where thine honour dwelleth
gather not my soul with sinners nor my life with bloody men
in whose hands is mischief and their right hand is full of
bribes
but as for me i will walk in mine integrity redeem me and be
merciful unto me
my foot standeth in an even place in the congregations will i
bless the lord
the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the
lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid
when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to
eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell
though an host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear
though war should rise against me in this will i be confident
one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after
that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to
behold the beauty of the lord and to enquire in his temple
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in
the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon
a rock
and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy
i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord
hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me
and answer me
when thou saidst seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy
face lord will i seek
hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger
thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my
salvation
when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take
me up
teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a plain path because
of mine enemies
deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies for false
witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty
i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the
lord in the land of the living
wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen
thine heart wait i say on the lord
unto thee will i cry o lord my rock be not silent to me lest
if thou be silent to me i become like them that go down into the pit
hear the voice of my supplications when i cry unto thee when i
lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle
draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of
iniquity which speak peace to their neighbours but mischief is in
their hearts
give them according to their deeds and according to the
wickedness of their endeavours give them after the work of their
hands render to them their desert
because they regard not the works of the lord nor the operation
of his hands he shall destroy them and not build them up
blessed be the lord because he hath heard the voice of my
supplications
the lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him
and i am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my
song will i praise him
the lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his
anointed
save thy people and bless thine inheritance feed them also and
lift them up for ever
give unto the lord o ye mighty give unto the lord glory and
strength
give unto the lord the glory due unto his name worship the lord
in the beauty of holiness
the voice of the lord is upon the waters the god of glory
thundereth the lord is upon many waters
the voice of the lord is powerful the voice of the lord is full
of majesty
the voice of the lord breaketh the cedars yea the lord breaketh
the cedars of lebanon
he maketh them also to skip like a calf lebanon and sirion like
a young unicorn
the voice of the lord divideth the flames of fire
the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness the lord shaketh
the wilderness of kadesh
the voice of the lord maketh the hinds to calve and discovereth
the forests and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory
the lord sitteth upon the flood yea the lord sitteth king for
ever
the lord will give strength unto his people the lord will bless
his people with peace
i will extol thee o lord for thou hast lifted me up and hast
not made my foes to rejoice over me
o lord my god i cried unto thee and thou hast healed me
o lord thou hast brought up my soul from the grave thou hast
kept me alive that i should not go down to the pit
sing unto the lord o ye saints of his and give thanks at the
remembrance of his holiness
for his anger endureth but a moment in his favour is life
weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning
and in my prosperity i said i shall never be moved
lord by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong
thou didst hide thy face and i was troubled
i cried to thee o lord and unto the lord i made supplication
what profit is there in my blood when i go down to the pit
shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth
hear o lord and have mercy upon me lord be thou my helper
thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing thou hast put
off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be
silent
o lord my god i will give thanks unto thee for ever
in thee o lord do i put my trust let me never be ashamed
deliver me in thy righteousness
bow down thine ear to me deliver me speedily be thou my strong
rock for an house of defence to save me
for thou art my rock and my fortress therefore for thy names
sake lead me and guide me
pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me for
thou art my strength
into thine hand i commit my spirit thou hast redeemed me o lord
god of truth
i have hated them that regard lying vanities but i trust in the
lord
i will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy for thou hast considered
my trouble thou hast known my soul in adversities
and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou hast set
my feet in a large room
have mercy upon me o lord for i am in trouble mine eye is
consumed with grief yea my soul and my belly
for my life is spent with grief and my years with sighing my
strength faileth because of mine iniquity and my bones are consumed
i was a reproach among all mine enemies but especially among my
neighbours and a fear to mine acquaintance they that did see me
without fled from me
i am forgotten as a dead man out of mind i am like a broken
vessel
for i have heard the slander of many fear was on every side
while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away
my life
but i trusted in thee o lord i said thou art my god
my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine
enemies and from them that persecute me
make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy
mercies sake
let me not be ashamed o lord for i have called upon thee let
the wicked be ashamed and let them be silent in the grave
let the lying lips be put to silence which speak grievous
things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous
oh how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them
that fear thee which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee
before the sons of men
thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
pride of man thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the
strife of tongues
blessed be the lord for he hath shewed me his marvellous
kindness in a strong city
for i said in my haste i am cut off from before thine eyes
nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when i cried
unto thee
o love the lord all ye his saints for the lord preserveth the
faithful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer
be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye
that hope in the lord
blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is
covered
blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and
in whose spirit there is no guile
when i kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all
the day long
for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture is
turned into the drought of summer selah
i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hid
i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou
forgavest the iniquity of my sin selah
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time
when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of great waters they
shall not come nigh unto him
thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble
thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance selah
i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt
go i will guide thee with mine eye
be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no
understanding whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle lest
they come near unto thee
many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the
lord mercy shall compass him about
be glad in the lord and rejoice ye righteous and shout for
joy all ye that are upright in heart
rejoice in the lord o ye righteous for praise is comely for the
upright
praise the lord with harp sing unto him with the psaltery and an
instrument of ten strings
sing unto him a new song play skilfully with a loud noise
for the word of the lord is right and all his works are done in
truth
he loveth righteousness and judgment the earth is full of the
goodness of the lord
by the word of the lord were the heavens made and all the host
of them by the breath of his mouth
he gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap he layeth
up the depth in storehouses
let all the earth fear the lord let all the inhabitants of the
world stand in awe of him
for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast
the lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought he
maketh the devices of the people of none effect
the counsel of the lord standeth for ever the thoughts of his
heart to all generations
blessed is the nation whose god is the lord and the people whom
he hath chosen for his own inheritance
the lord looketh from heaven he beholdeth all the sons of men
from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
inhabitants of the earth
he fashioneth their hearts alike he considereth all their
works
there is no king saved by the multitude of an host a mighty man
is not delivered by much strength
an horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver
any by his great strength
behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon
them that hope in his mercy
to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in
famine
our soul waiteth for the lord he is our help and our shield
for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in
his holy name
let thy mercy o lord be upon us according as we hope in thee
i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually
be in my mouth
my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear
thereof and be glad
o magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together
i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my
fears
they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were
not ashamed
this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of
all his troubles
the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him
and delivereth them
o taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that
trusteth in him
o fear the lord ye his saints for there is no want to them that
fear him
the young lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek
the lord shall not want any good thing
come ye children hearken unto me i will teach you the fear of
the lord
what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days that he
may see good
keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile
depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it
the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are
open unto their cry
the face of the lord is against them that do evil to cut off
the remembrance of them from the earth
the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out
of all their troubles
the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and
saveth such as be of a contrite spirit
many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord
delivereth him out of them all
he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken
evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous
shall be desolate
the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them
that trust in him shall be desolate
plead my cause o lord with them that strive with me fight
against them that fight against me
take hold of shield and buckler and stand up for mine help
draw out also the spear and stop the way against them that
persecute me say unto my soul i am thy salvation
let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul
let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt
let them be as chaff before the wind and let the angel of the
lord chase them
let their way be dark and slippery and let the angel of the lord
persecute them
for without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit which
without cause they have digged for my soul
let destruction come upon him at unawares and let his net that
he hath hid catch himself into that very destruction let him fall
and my soul shall be joyful in the lord it shall rejoice in his
salvation
all my bones shall say lord who is like unto thee which
deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him yea the poor
and the needy from him that spoileth him
false witnesses did rise up they laid to my charge things that
i knew not
they rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul
but as for me when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth i
humbled my soul with fasting and my prayer returned into mine own
bosom
i behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother i
bowed down heavily as one that mourneth for his mother
but in mine adversity they rejoiced and gathered themselves
together yea the abjects gathered themselves together against me
and i knew it not they did tear me and ceased not
with hypocritical mockers in feasts they gnashed upon me with
their teeth
lord how long wilt thou look on rescue my soul from their
destructions my darling from the lions
i will give thee thanks in the great congregation i will praise
thee among much people
let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me
neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause
for they speak not peace but they devise deceitful matters
against them that are quiet in the land
yea they opened their mouth wide against me and said aha
aha our eye hath seen it
this thou hast seen o lord keep not silence o lord be not
far from me
stir up thyself and awake to my judgment even unto my cause
my god and my lord
judge me o lord my god according to thy righteousness and let
them not rejoice over me
let them not say in their hearts ah so would we have it let
them not say we have swallowed him up
let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
rejoice at mine hurt let them be clothed with shame and dishonour
that magnify themselves against me
let them shout for joy and be glad that favour my righteous
cause yea let them say continually let the lord be magnified which
hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant
and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise
all the day long
the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart that there
is no fear of god before his eyes
for he flattereth himself in his own eyes until his iniquity be
found to be hateful
the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he hath left off
to be wise and to do good
he deviseth mischief upon his bed he setteth himself in a way
that is not good he abhorreth not evil
thy mercy o lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness
reacheth unto the clouds
thy righteousness is like the great mountains thy judgments are
a great deep o lord thou preservest man and beast
how excellent is thy lovingkindness o god therefore the
children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house
and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures
for with thee is the fountain of life in thy light shall we see
light
o continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee and thy
righteousness to the upright in heart
let not the foot of pride come against me and let not the hand
of the wicked remove me
there are the workers of iniquity fallen they are cast down
and shall not be able to rise
fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious
against the workers of iniquity
for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the
green herb
trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land
and verily thou shalt be fed
delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the
desires of thine heart
commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall
bring it to pass
and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy
judgment as the noonday
rest in the lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself
because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who
bringeth wicked devices to pass
cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise
to do evil
for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the
lord they shall inherit the earth
for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou
shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be
but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight
themselves in the abundance of peace
the wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with
his teeth
the lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is
coming
the wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to
cast down the poor and needy and to slay such as be of upright
conversation
their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows
shall be broken
a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of
many wicked
for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the lord
upholdeth the righteous
the lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance
shall be for ever
they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of
famine they shall be satisfied
but the wicked shall perish and the enemies of the lord shall
be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they
consume away
the wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous
sheweth mercy and giveth
for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they
that be cursed of him shall be cut off
the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he
delighteth in his way
though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord
upholdeth him with his hand
i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the
righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread
he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed
depart from evil and do good and dwell for evermore
for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints they
are preserved for ever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off
the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for
ever
the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue
talketh of judgment
the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall
slide
the wicked watcheth the righteous and seeketh to slay him
the lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he
is judged
wait on the lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to
inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see it
i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself
like a green bay tree
yet he passed away and lo he was not yea i sought him but
he could not be found
mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of
that man is peace
but the transgressors shall be destroyed together the end of
the wicked shall be cut off
but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their
strength in the time of trouble
and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver
them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him
o lord rebuke me not in thy wrath neither chasten me in thy hot
displeasure
for thine arrows stick fast in me and thy hand presseth me sore
there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger neither
is there any rest in my bones because of my sin
for mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy burden
they are too heavy for me
my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness
i am troubled i am bowed down greatly i go mourning all the day
long
for my loins are filled with a loathsome disease and there is no
soundness in my flesh
i am feeble and sore broken i have roared by reason of the
disquietness of my heart
lord all my desire is before thee and my groaning is not hid
from thee
my heart panteth my strength faileth me as for the light of
mine eyes it also is gone from me
my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore and my
kinsmen stand afar off
they also that seek after my life lay snares for me and they
that seek my hurt speak mischievous things and imagine deceits all
the day long
but i as a deaf man heard not and i was as a dumb man that
openeth not his mouth
thus i was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no
reproofs
for in thee o lord do i hope thou wilt hear o lord my god
for i said hear me lest otherwise they should rejoice over me
when my foot slippeth they magnify themselves against me
for i am ready to halt and my sorrow is continually before me
for i will declare mine iniquity i will be sorry for my sin
but mine enemies are lively and they are strong and they that
hate me wrongfully are multiplied
they also that render evil for good are mine adversaries
because i follow the thing that good is
forsake me not o lord o my god be not far from me
make haste to help me o lord my salvation
i said i will take heed to my ways that i sin not with my
tongue i will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before
me
i was dumb with silence i held my peace even from good and my
sorrow was stirred
my heart was hot within me while i was musing the fire burned
then spake i with my tongue
lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what
it is that i may know how frail i am
behold thou hast made my days as an handbreadth and mine age is
as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is
altogether vanity
selah
surely every man walketh in a vain shew surely they are
disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall
gather them
and now lord what wait i for my hope is in thee
deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach
of the foolish
i was dumb i opened not my mouth because thou didst it
remove thy stroke away from me i am consumed by the blow of
thine hand
when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity thou
makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is
vanity selah
hear my prayer o lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy
peace at my tears for i am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as
all my fathers were
o spare me that i may recover strength before i go hence and
be no more
i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and
heard my cry
he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry
clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings
and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god
many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord
blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and
respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies
many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou hast
done and thy thoughts which are to usward they cannot be reckoned
up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are
more than can be numbered
sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears hast thou
opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required
then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written
of me
i delight to do thy will o my god yea thy law is within my
heart
i have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo i
have not refrained my lips o lord thou knowest
i have not hid thy righteousness within my heart i have
declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation i have not concealed thy
lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation
withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me o lord let thy
lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me
for innumerable evils have compassed me about mine iniquities
have taken hold upon me so that i am not able to look up they are
more than the hairs of mine head therefore my heart faileth me
be pleased o lord to deliver me o lord make haste to help
me
let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
soul to destroy it let them be driven backward and put to shame that
wish me evil
let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
me aha aha
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let
such as love thy salvation say continually the lord be magnified
but i am poor and needy yet the lord thinketh upon me thou art
my help and my deliverer make no tarrying o my god
blessed is he that considereth the poor the lord will deliver
him in time of trouble
the lord will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be
blessed upon the earth and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of
his enemies
the lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing thou
wilt make all his bed in his sickness
i said lord be merciful unto me heal my soul for i have
sinned against thee
mine enemies speak evil of me when shall he die and his name
perish
and if he come to see me he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth
iniquity to itself when he goeth abroad he telleth it
all that hate me whisper together against me against me do they
devise my hurt
an evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto him and now that
he lieth he shall rise up no more
yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat
of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me
but thou o lord be merciful unto me and raise me up that i
may requite them
by this i know that thou favourest me because mine enemy doth
not triumph over me
and as for me thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest
me before thy face for ever
blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting and to
everlasting amen and amen
as the hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul
after thee o god
my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come
and appear before god
my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually
say unto me where is thy god
when i remember these things i pour out my soul in me for i had
gone with the multitude i went with them to the house of god with
the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holyday
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted in
me  hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him for the help of his
countenance
o my god my soul is cast down within me therefore will i
remember thee from the land of jordan and of the hermonites from the
hill mizar
deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy
waves and thy billows are gone over me
yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the day time and
in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of
my life
i will say unto god my rock why hast thou forgotten me why go i
mourning because of the oppression of the enemy
as with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me while
they say daily unto me where is thy god
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted
within me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him who is the
health of my countenance and my god
judge me o god and plead my cause against an ungodly nation o
deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man
for thou art the god of my strength why dost thou cast me off
why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy
o send out thy light and thy truth let them lead me let them
bring me unto thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles
then will i go unto the altar of god unto god my exceeding joy
yea upon the harp will i praise thee o god my god
why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted
within me hope in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health
of my countenance and my god
we have heard with our ears o god our fathers have told us
what work thou didst in their days in the times of old
how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand and plantedst
them how thou didst afflict the people and cast them out
for they got not the land in possession by their own sword
neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine
arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hadst a favour
unto them
thou art my king o god command deliverances for jacob
through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name will
we tread them under that rise up against us
for i will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me
but thou hast saved us from our enemies and hast put them to
shame that hated us
in god we boast all the day long and praise thy name for ever
selah
but thou hast cast off and put us to shame and goest not forth
with our armies
thou makest us to turn back from the enemy and they which hate
us spoil for themselves
thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat and hast
scattered us among the heathen
thou sellest thy people for nought and dost not increase thy
wealth by their price
thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and a
derision to them that are round about us
thou makest us a byword among the heathen a shaking of the head
among the people
my confusion is continually before me and the shame of my face
hath covered me
for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth by reason
of the enemy and avenger
all this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee
neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant
our heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined
from thy way
though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons and
covered us with the shadow of death
if we have forgotten the name of our god or stretched out our
hands to a strange god
shall not god search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the
heart
yea for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted
as sheep for the slaughter
awake why sleepest thou o lord arise cast us not off for
ever
wherefore hidest thou thy face and forgettest our affliction
and our oppression
for our soul is bowed down to the dust our belly cleaveth unto
the earth
arise for our help and redeem us for thy mercies sake
my heart is inditing a good matter i speak of the things which i
have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer
thou art fairer than the children of men grace is poured into
thy lips therefore god hath blessed thee for ever
gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory and
thy majesty
and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
meekness and righteousness and thy right hand shall teach thee
terrible things
thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the kings enemies
whereby the people fall under thee
thy throne o god is for ever and ever the sceptre of thy
kingdom is a right sceptre
thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness therefore god
thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows
all thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of
the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad
kings daughters were among thy honourable women upon thy right
hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir
hearken o daughter and consider and incline thine ear forget
also thine own people and thy fathers house
so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty for he is thy lord
and worship thou him
and the daughter of tyre shall be there with a gift even the
rich among the people shall intreat thy favour
the kings daughter is all glorious within her clothing is of
wrought gold
she shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework the
virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee
with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall
enter into the kings palace
instead of thy fathers shall be thy children whom thou mayest
make princes in all the earth
i will make thy name to be remembered in all generations
therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever
god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble
therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea
though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the
mountains shake with the swelling thereof selah
there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of
god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high
god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall
help her and that right early
the heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice
the earth melted
the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge
selah
come behold the works of the lord what desolations he hath made
in the earth
he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh
the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth the chariot in
the fire
be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the
heathen i will be exalted in the earth
the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge
selah
o clap your hands all ye people shout unto god with the voice
of triumph
for the lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all
the earth
he shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our
feet
he shall choose our inheritance for us the excellency of jacob
whom he loved selah
god is gone up with a shout the lord with the sound of a
trumpet
sing praises to god sing praises sing praises unto our king
sing praises
for god is the king of all the earth sing ye praises with
understanding
god reigneth over the heathen god sitteth upon the throne of his
holiness
the princes of the people are gathered together even the people
of the god of abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto god
he is greatly exalted
great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our
god in the mountain of his holiness
beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount
zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king
god is known in her palaces for a refuge
for lo the kings were assembled they passed by together
they saw it and so they marvelled they were troubled and
hasted away
fear took hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in
travail
thou breakest the ships of tarshish with an east wind
as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the lord of
hosts in the city of our god god will establish it for ever selah
we have thought of thy lovingkindness o god in the midst of thy
temple
according to thy name o god so is thy praise unto the ends of
the earth thy right hand is full of righteousness
let mount zion rejoice let the daughters of judah be glad
because of thy judgments
walk about zion and go round about her tell the towers
thereof
mark ye well her bulwarks consider her palaces that ye may
tell it to the generation following
for this god is our god for ever and ever he will be our guide
even unto death
hear this all ye people give ear all ye inhabitants of the
world
both low and high rich and poor together
my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart
shall be of understanding
i will incline mine ear to a parable i will open my dark saying
upon the harp
wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of
my heels shall compass me about
they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the
multitude of their riches
none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to god
a ransom for him
for the redemption of their soul is precious and it ceaseth for
ever
that he should still live for ever and not see corruption
for he seeth that wise men die likewise the fool and the
brutish person perish and leave their wealth to others
their inward thought is that their houses shall continue for
ever and their dwelling places to all generations they call their
lands after their own names
nevertheless man being in honour abideth not he is like the
beasts that perish
this their way is their folly yet their posterity approve their
sayings selah
like sheep they are laid in the grave death shall feed on them
and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning and
their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling
but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave for he
shall receive me selah
be not thou afraid when one is made rich when the glory of his
house is increased
for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall
not descend after him
though while he lived he blessed his soul and men will praise
thee when thou doest well to thyself
he shall go to the generation of his fathers they shall never
see light
man that is in honour and understandeth not is like the beasts
that perish
the mighty god even the lord hath spoken and called the earth
from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof
out of zion the perfection of beauty god hath shined
our god shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall
devour before him and it shall be very tempestuous round about him
he shall call to the heavens from above and to the earth that
he may judge his people
gather my saints together unto me those that have made a
covenant with me by sacrifice
and the heavens shall declare his righteousness for god is judge
himself selah
hear o my people and i will speak o israel and i will testify
against thee i am god even thy god
i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
offerings to have been continually before me
i will take no bullock out of thy house nor he goats out of thy
folds
for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a
thousand hills
i know all the fowls of the mountains and the wild beasts of
the field are mine
if i were hungry i would not tell thee for the world is mine
and the fulness thereof
will i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats
offer unto god thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most
high
and call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver thee and
thou shalt glorify me
but unto the wicked god saith what hast thou to do to declare
my statutes or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth
seeing thou hatest instruction and casteth my words behind
thee
when thou sawest a thief then thou consentedst with him and
hast been partaker with adulterers
thou givest thy mouth to evil and thy tongue frameth deceit
thou sittest and speakest against thy brother thou slanderest
thine own mothers son
these things hast thou done and i kept silence thou thoughtest
that i was altogether such an one as thyself but i will reprove thee
and set them in order before thine eyes
now consider this ye that forget god lest i tear you in
pieces and there be none to deliver
whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth
his conversation aright will i shew the salvation of god
have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions
wash me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin
for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before
me
against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy
sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be
clear when thou judgest
behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother
conceive me
behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the
hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom
purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall
be whiter than snow
make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast
broken may rejoice
hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities
create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit
within me
cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit
from me
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy
free spirit
then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be
converted unto thee
deliver me from bloodguiltiness o god thou god of my
salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness
o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall shew forth thy
praise
for thou desirest not sacrifice else would i give it thou
delightest not in burnt offering
the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a
contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise
do good in thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of
jerusalem
then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness
with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer
bullocks upon thine altar
why boastest thou thyself in mischief o mighty man the goodness
of god endureth continually
the tongue deviseth mischiefs like a sharp razor working
deceitfully
thou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak
righteousness selah
thou lovest all devouring words o thou deceitful tongue
god shall likewise destroy thee for ever he shall take thee
away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place and root thee out of
the land of the living selah
the righteous also shall see and fear and shall laugh at him
lo this is the man that made not god his strength but trusted
in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his
wickedness
but i am like a green olive tree in the house of god i trust in
the mercy of god for ever and ever
i will praise thee for ever because thou hast done it and i
will wait on thy name for it is good before thy saints
the fool hath said in his heart there is no god corrupt are
they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth
good
god looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if
there were any that did understand that did seek god
every one of them is gone back they are altogether become
filthy there is none that doeth good no not one
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people
as they eat bread they have not called upon god
there were they in great fear where no fear was for god hath
scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee thou hast put
them to shame because god hath despised them
oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when god
bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and
israel shall be glad
save me o god by thy name and judge me by thy strength
hear my prayer o god give ear to the words of my mouth
for strangers are risen up against me and oppressors seek after
my soul they have not set god before them selah
behold god is mine helper the lord is with them that uphold my
soul
he shall reward evil unto mine enemies cut them off in thy
truth
i will freely sacrifice unto thee i will praise thy name o
lord for it is good
for he hath delivered me out of all trouble and mine eye hath
seen his desire upon mine enemies
give ear to my prayer o god and hide not thyself from my
supplication
attend unto me and hear me i mourn in my complaint and make a
noise
because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of
the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in wrath they hate me
my heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are
fallen upon me
fearfulness and trembling are come upon me and horror hath
overwhelmed me
and i said oh that i had wings like a dove for then would i fly
away and be at rest
lo then would i wander far off and remain in the wilderness
selah
i would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest
destroy o lord and divide their tongues for i have seen
violence and strife in the city
day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof mischief
also and sorrow are in the midst of it
wickedness is in the midst thereof deceit and guile depart not
from her streets
for it was not an enemy that reproached me then i could have
borne it neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself
against me then i would have hid myself from him
but it was thou a man mine equal my guide and mine
acquaintance
we took sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of god
in company
let death seize upon them and let them go down quick into hell
for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them
as for me i will call upon god and the lord shall save me
evening and morning and at noon will i pray and cry aloud
and he shall hear my voice
he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
against me for there were many with me
god shall hear and afflict them even he that abideth of old
selah because they have no changes therefore they fear not god
he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
him he hath broken his covenant
the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in
his heart his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords
cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he
shall never suffer the righteous to be moved
but thou o god shalt bring them down into the pit of
destruction bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their
days but i will trust in thee
be merciful unto me o god for man would swallow me up he
fighting daily oppresseth me
mine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that
fight against me o thou most high
what time i am afraid i will trust in thee
in god i will praise his word in god i have put my trust i will
not fear what flesh can do unto me
every day they wrest my words all their thoughts are against me
for evil
they gather themselves together they hide themselves they mark
my steps when they wait for my soul
shall they escape by iniquity in thine anger cast down the
people o god
thou tellest my wanderings put thou my tears into thy bottle
are they not in thy book
when i cry unto thee then shall mine enemies turn back this i
know for god is for me
in god will i praise his word in the lord will i praise his
word
in god have i put my trust i will not be afraid what man can do
unto me
thy vows are upon me o god i will render praises unto thee
for thou hast delivered my soul from death wilt not thou
deliver my feet from falling that i may walk before god in the light
of the living
be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me for my soul
trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy wings will i make my
refuge until these calamities be overpast
i will cry unto god most high unto god that performeth all
things for me
he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him
that would swallow me up selah god shall send forth his mercy and
his truth
my soul is among lions and i lie even among them that are set on
fire even the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows and
their tongue a sharp sword
be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above
all the earth
they have prepared a net for my steps my soul is bowed down
they have digged a pit before me into the midst whereof they are
fallen themselves selah
my heart is fixed o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give
praise
awake up my glory awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake
early
i will praise thee o lord among the people i will sing unto
thee among the nations
for thy mercy is great unto the heavens and thy truth unto the
clouds
be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be
above all the earth
do ye indeed speak righteousness o congregation do ye judge
uprightly o ye sons of men
yea in heart ye work wickedness ye weigh the violence of your
hands in the earth
the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as
they be born speaking lies
their poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the
deaf adder that stoppeth her ear
which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never
so wisely
break their teeth o god in their mouth break out the great
teeth of the young lions o lord
let them melt away as waters which run continually when he
bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows let them be as cut in pieces
as a snail which melteth let every one of them pass away like
the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sun
before your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as
with a whirlwind both living and in his wrath
the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance he
shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked
so that a man shall say verily there is a reward for the
righteous verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth
deliver me from mine enemies o my god defend me from them that
rise up against me

men

against me not for my transgression nor for my sin o lord

me and behold

visit all the heathen be not merciful to any wicked transgressors
selah

round about the city

lips for who say they doth hear
but thou o lord shalt laugh at them thou shalt have all the
heathen in derision

defence

desire upon mine enemies
slay them not lest my people forget scatter them by thy power
and bring them down o lord our shield
for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them
even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they
speak
consume them in wrath consume them that they may not be and
let them know that god ruleth in jacob unto the ends of the earth
selah
and at evening let them return and let them make a noise like a
dog and go round about the city
let them wander up and down for meat and grudge if they be not
satisfied
but i will sing of thy power yea i will sing aloud of thy
mercy in the morning for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the
day of my trouble
unto thee o my strength will i sing for god is my defence
and the god of my mercy
o god thou hast cast us off thou hast scattered us thou hast
been displeased o turn thyself to us again
thou hast made the earth to tremble thou hast broken it heal
the breaches thereof for it shaketh
thou hast shewed thy people hard things thou hast made us to
drink the wine of astonishment
thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be
displayed because of the truth selah
that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and
hear me
god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide
shechem and mete out the valley of succoth
gilead is mine and manasseh is mine ephraim also is the
strength of mine head judah is my lawgiver
moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe philistia
triumph thou because of me
who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into
edom
wilt not thou o god which hadst cast us off and thou o god
which didst not go out with our armies
give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man
through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread
down our enemies
hear my cry o god attend unto my prayer
from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is
overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i
for thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the
enemy
i will abide in thy tabernacle for ever i will trust in the
covert of thy wings selah
for thou o god hast heard my vows thou hast given me the
heritage of those that fear thy name
thou wilt prolong the kings life and his years as many
generations
he shall abide before god for ever o prepare mercy and truth
which may preserve him
so will i sing praise unto thy name for ever that i may daily
perform my vows
truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation
he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall
not be greatly moved
how long will ye imagine mischief against a man ye shall be
slain all of you as a bowing wall shall ye be and as a tottering
fence
they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they
delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly
selah
my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him
he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall
not be moved
in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and
my refuge is in god
trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before
him god is a refuge for us selah
surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a
lie to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter than
vanity
trust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery if
riches increase set not your heart upon them
god hath spoken once twice have i heard this that power
belongeth unto god
also unto thee o lord belongeth mercy for thou renderest to
every man according to his work
o god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth
for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where
no water is
to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the
sanctuary
because thy lovingkindness is better than life my lips shall
praise thee
thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in
thy name
my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my
mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips
when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the
night watches
because thou hast been my help therefore in the shadow of thy
wings will i rejoice
my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me
but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the
lower parts of the earth
they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes
but the king shall rejoice in god every one that sweareth by
him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be
stopped
hear my voice o god in my prayer preserve my life from fear of
the enemy
hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked from the
insurrection of the workers of iniquity
who whet their tongue like a sword and bend their bows to shoot
their arrows even bitter words
that they may shoot in secret at the perfect suddenly do they
shoot at him and fear not
they encourage themselves in an evil matter they commune of
laying snares privily they say who shall see them
they search out iniquities they accomplish a diligent search
both the inward thought of every one of them and the heart is deep
but god shall shoot at them with an arrow suddenly shall they be
wounded
so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves all
that see them shall flee away
and all men shall fear and shall declare the work of god for
they shall wisely consider of his doing
the righteous shall be glad in the lord and shall trust in him
and all the upright in heart shall glory
praise waiteth for thee o god in sion and unto thee shall the
vow be performed
o thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come
iniquities prevail against me as for our transgressions thou
shalt purge them away
blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causest to approach
unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with
the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us o god of
our salvation who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth
and of them that are afar off upon the sea
which by his strength setteth fast the mountains being girded
with power
which stilleth the noise of the seas the noise of their waves
and the tumult of the people
they also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
tokens thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
rejoice
thou visitest the earth and waterest it thou greatly enrichest
it with the river of god which is full of water thou preparest them
corn when thou hast so provided for it
thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly thou settlest the
furrows thereof thou makest it soft with showers thou blessest the
springing thereof
thou crownest the year with thy goodness and thy paths drop
fatness
they drop upon the pastures of the wilderness and the little
hills rejoice on every side
the pastures are clothed with flocks the valleys also are
covered over with corn they shout for joy they also sing
make a joyful noise unto god all ye lands
sing forth the honour of his name make his praise glorious
say unto god how terrible art thou in thy works through the
greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto
thee
all the earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee they
shall sing to thy name selah
come and see the works of god he is terrible in his doing toward
the children of men
he turned the sea into dry land they went through the flood on
foot there did we rejoice in him
he ruleth by his power for ever his eyes behold the nations let
not the rebellious exalt themselves selah
o bless our god ye people and make the voice of his praise to
be heard
which holdeth our soul in life and suffereth not our feet to be
moved
for thou o god hast proved us thou hast tried us as silver
is tried
thou broughtest us into the net thou laidst affliction upon our
loins
thou hast caused men to ride over our heads we went through
fire and through water but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy
place
i will go into thy house with burnt offerings i will pay thee
my vows
which my lips have uttered and my mouth hath spoken when i was
in trouble
i will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings with the
incense of rams i will offer bullocks with goats selah
come and hear all ye that fear god and i will declare what he
hath done for my soul
i cried unto him with my mouth and he was extolled with my
tongue
if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me
but verily god hath heard me he hath attended to the voice of
my prayer
blessed be god which hath not turned away my prayer nor his
mercy from me
god be merciful unto us and bless us and cause his face to
shine upon us selah
that thy way may be known upon earth thy saving health among all
nations
let the people praise thee o god let all the people praise
thee
o let the nations be glad and sing for joy for thou shalt judge
the people righteously and govern the nations upon earth selah
let the people praise thee o god let all the people praise
thee
then shall the earth yield her increase and god even our own
god shall bless us
god shall bless us and all the ends of the earth shall fear him
let god arise let his enemies be scattered let them also that
hate him flee before him
as smoke is driven away so drive them away as wax melteth
before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of god
but let the righteous be glad let them rejoice before god yea
let them exceedingly rejoice
sing unto god sing praises to his name extol him that rideth
upon the heavens by his name jah and rejoice before him
a father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows is god in
his holy habitation
god setteth the solitary in families he bringeth out those which
are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in a dry land
o god when thou wentest forth before thy people when thou didst
march through the wilderness selah
the earth shook the heavens also dropped at the presence of god
even sinai itself was moved at the presence of god the god of israel
thou o god didst send a plentiful rain whereby thou didst
confirm thine inheritance when it was weary
thy congregation hath dwelt therein thou o god hast prepared
of thy goodness for the poor
the lord gave the word great was the company of those that
published it
kings of armies did flee apace and she that tarried at home
divided the spoil
though ye have lien among the pots yet shall ye be as the wings
of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow gold
when the almighty scattered kings in it it was white as snow in
salmon
the hill of god is as the hill of bashan an high hill as the
hill of bashan
why leap ye ye high hills this is the hill which god desireth
to dwell in yea the lord will dwell in it for ever
the chariots of god are twenty thousand even thousands of
angels the lord is among them as in sinai in the holy place
thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive
thou hast received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that
the lord god might dwell among them
blessed be the lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even
the god of our salvation selah
he that is our god is the god of salvation and unto god the
lord belong the issues from death
but god shall wound the head of his enemies and the hairy scalp
of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses
the lord said i will bring again from bashan i will bring my
people again from the depths of the sea
that thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies and
the tongue of thy dogs in the same
they have seen thy goings o god even the goings of my god my
king in the sanctuary
the singers went before the players on instruments followed
after among them were the damsels playing with timbrels
bless ye god in the congregations even the lord from the
fountain of israel
there is little benjamin with their ruler the princes of judah
and their council the princes of zebulun and the princes of
naphtali
thy god hath commanded thy strength strengthen o god that
which thou hast wrought for us
because of thy temple at jerusalem shall kings bring presents
unto thee
rebuke the company of spearmen the multitude of the bulls with
the calves of the people till every one submit himself with pieces of
silver scatter thou the people that delight in war
princes shall come out of egypt ethiopia shall soon stretch out
her hands unto god
sing unto god ye kingdoms of the earth o sing praises unto the
lord selah
to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens which were of
old lo he doth send out his voice and that a mighty voice
ascribe ye strength unto god his excellency is over israel and
his strength is in the clouds
o god thou art terrible out of thy holy places the god of
israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people blessed
be god
save me o god for the waters are come in unto my soul
i sink in deep mire where there is no standing i am come into
deep waters where the floods overflow me
i am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while
i wait for my god
they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine
head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are
mighty then i restored that which i took not away
o god thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from
thee
let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed
for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o
god of israel
because for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my
face
i am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my
mothers children
for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches
of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me
when i wept and chastened my soul with fasting that was to my
reproach
i made sackcloth also my garment and i became a proverb to
them
they that sit in the gate speak against me and i was the song
of the drunkards
but as for me my prayer is unto thee o lord in an acceptable
time o god in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of
thy salvation
deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be
delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep waters
let not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow
me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me
hear me o lord for thy lovingkindness is good turn unto me
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies
and hide not thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble
hear me speedily
draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it deliver me because of
mine enemies
thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour
mine adversaries are all before thee
reproach hath broken my heart and i am full of heaviness and i
looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters
but i found none
they gave me also gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave
me vinegar to drink
let their table become a snare before them and that which
should have been for their welfare let it become a trap
let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their
loins continually to shake
pour out thine indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger
take hold of them
let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their
tents
for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten and they talk to
the grief of those whom thou hast wounded
add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy
righteousness
let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be
written with the righteous
but i am poor and sorrowful let thy salvation o god set me up
on high
i will praise the name of god with a song and will magnify him
with thanksgiving
this also shall please the lord better than an ox or bullock
that hath horns and hoofs
the humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall
live that seek god
for the lord heareth the poor and despiseth not his prisoners
let the heaven and earth praise him the seas and every thing
that moveth therein
for god will save zion and will build the cities of judah that
they may dwell there and have it in possession
the seed also of his servants shall inherit it and they that
love his name shall dwell therein
make haste o god to deliver me make haste to help me o lord
let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let
them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt
let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say
aha aha
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let
such as love thy salvation say continually let god be magnified
but i am poor and needy make haste unto me o god thou art my
help and my deliverer o lord make no tarrying
in thee o lord do i put my trust let me never be put to
confusion
deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline
thine ear unto me and save me
be thou my strong habitation whereunto i may continually resort
thou hast given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my
fortress
deliver me o my god out of the hand of the wicked out of the
hand of the unrighteous and cruel man
for thou art my hope o lord god thou art my trust from my
youth
by thee have i been holden up from the womb thou art he that
took me out of my mothers bowels my praise shall be continually of
thee
i am as a wonder unto many but thou art my strong refuge
let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
the day
cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my
strength faileth
for mine enemies speak against me and they that lay wait for my
soul take counsel together
saying god hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there
is none to deliver him
o god be not far from me o my god make haste for my help
let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my
hurt
but i will hope continually and will yet praise thee more and
more
my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
all the day for i know not the numbers thereof
i will go in the strength of the lord god i will make mention
of thy righteousness even of thine only
o god thou hast taught me from my youth and hitherto have i
declared thy wondrous works
now also when i am old and greyheaded o god forsake me not
until i have shewed thy strength unto this generation and thy power
to every one that is to come
thy righteousness also o god is very high who hast done great
things o god who is like unto thee
thou which hast shewed me great and sore troubles shalt
quicken me again and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the
earth
thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side
i will also praise thee with the psaltery even thy truth o my
god unto thee will i sing with the harp o thou holy one of israel
my lips shall greatly rejoice when i sing unto thee and my
soul which thou hast redeemed
my tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long
for they are confounded for they are brought unto shame that seek my
hurt
give the king thy judgments o god and thy righteousness unto
the kings son
he shall judge thy people with righteousness and thy poor with
judgment
the mountains shall bring peace to the people and the little
hills by righteousness
he shall judge the poor of the people he shall save the children
of the needy and shall break in pieces the oppressor
they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure
throughout all generations
he shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as showers that
water the earth
in his days shall the righteous flourish and abundance of peace
so long as the moon endureth
he shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river
unto the ends of the earth
they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him and his
enemies shall lick the dust
the kings of tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents the
kings of sheba and seba shall offer gifts
yea all kings shall fall down before him all nations shall
serve him
for he shall deliver the needy when he crieth the poor also
and him that hath no helper
he shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of
the needy
he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and
precious shall their blood be in his sight
and he shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of
sheba prayer also shall be made for him continually and daily shall
he be praised
there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
the mountains the fruit thereof shall shake like lebanon and they of
the city shall flourish like grass of the earth
his name shall endure for ever his name shall be continued as
long as the sun and men shall be blessed in him all nations shall
call him blessed
blessed be the lord god the god of israel who only doeth
wondrous things
and blessed be his glorious name for ever and let the whole
earth be filled with his glory amen and amen
the prayers of david the son of jesse are ended
truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean
heart
but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh
slipped
for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of
the wicked
for there are no bands in their death but their strength is
firm
they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued
like other men
therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain violence
covereth them as a garment
their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart
could wish
they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they
speak loftily
they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue
walketh through the earth
therefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are
wrung out to them
and they say how doth god know and is there knowledge in the
most high
behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they
increase in riches
verily i have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in
innocency
for all the day long have i been plagued and chastened every
morning
if i say i will speak thus behold i should offend against the
generation of thy children
when i thought to know this it was too painful for me
until i went into the sanctuary of god then understood i their
end
surely thou didst set them in slippery places thou castedst
them down into destruction
how are they brought into desolation as in a moment they are
utterly consumed with terrors
as a dream when one awaketh so o lord when thou awakest thou
shalt despise their image
thus my heart was grieved and i was pricked in my reins
so foolish was i and ignorant i was as a beast before thee
nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast holden me by
my right hand
thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me
to glory
whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth
that i desire beside thee
my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my
heart and my portion for ever
for lo they that are far from thee shall perish thou hast
destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee
but it is good for me to draw near to god i have put my trust
in the lord god that i may declare all thy works
o god why hast thou cast us off for ever why doth thine anger
smoke against the sheep of thy pasture
remember thy congregation which thou hast purchased of old the
rod of thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed this mount zion
wherein thou hast dwelt
lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations even all that
the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary
thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations they set up
their ensigns for signs
a man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
thick trees
but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes
and hammers
they have cast fire into thy sanctuary they have defiled by
casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground
they said in their hearts let us destroy them together they
have burned up all the synagogues of god in the land
we see not our signs there is no more any prophet neither is
there among us any that knoweth how long
o god how long shall the adversary reproach shall the enemy
blaspheme thy name for ever
why withdrawest thou thy hand even thy right hand pluck it out
of thy bosom
for god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the
earth
thou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou brakest the
heads of the dragons in the waters
thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to
be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness
thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood thou driedst up
mighty rivers
the day is thine the night also is thine thou hast prepared
the light and the sun
thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made
summer and winter
remember this that the enemy hath reproached o lord and that
the foolish people have blasphemed thy name
o deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
the wicked forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever
have respect unto the covenant for the dark places of the earth
are full of the habitations of cruelty
o let not the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy
praise thy name
arise o god plead thine own cause remember how the foolish
man reproacheth thee daily
forget not the voice of thine enemies the tumult of those that
rise up against thee increaseth continually
unto thee o god do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks
for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare
when i shall receive the congregation i will judge uprightly
the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved i bear
up the pillars of it selah
i said unto the fools deal not foolishly and to the wicked
lift not up the horn
lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck
for promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west
nor from the south
but god is the judge he putteth down one and setteth up
another
for in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red
it is full of mixture and he poureth out of the same but the dregs
thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out and drink
them
but i will declare for ever i will sing praises to the god of
jacob
all the horns of the wicked also will i cut off but the horns
of the righteous shall be exalted
in judah is god known his name is great in israel
in salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in zion
there brake he the arrows of the bow the shield and the sword
and the battle selah
thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey
the stouthearted are spoiled they have slept their sleep and
none of the men of might have found their hands
at thy rebuke o god of jacob both the chariot and horse are
cast into a dead sleep
thou even thou art to be feared and who may stand in thy sight
when once thou art angry
thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven the earth
feared and was still
when god arose to judgment to save all the meek of the earth
selah
surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of
wrath shalt thou restrain
vow and pay unto the lord your god let all that be round about
him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared
he shall cut off the spirit of princes he is terrible to the
kings of the earth
i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and
he gave ear unto me
in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my sore ran in the
night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted
i remembered god and was troubled i complained and my spirit
was overwhelmed selah
thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so troubled that i cannot
speak
i have considered the days of old the years of ancient times
i call to remembrance my song in the night i commune with mine
own heart and my spirit made diligent search
will the lord cast off for ever and will he be favourable no
more
is his mercy clean gone for ever doth his promise fail for
evermore
hath god forgotten to be gracious hath he in anger shut up his
tender mercies selah
and i said this is my infirmity but i will remember the years
of the right hand of the most high
i will remember the works of the lord surely i will remember
thy wonders of old
i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doings
thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is so great a god as
our god
thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast declared thy
strength among the people
thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob
and joseph selah
the waters saw thee o god the waters saw thee they were
afraid the depths also were troubled
the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine
arrows also went abroad
the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings
lightened the world the earth trembled and shook
thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy
footsteps are not known
thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and
aaron
give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the words
of my mouth
i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of
old
which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us
we will not hide them from their children shewing to the
generation to come the praises of the lord and his strength and his
wonderful works that he hath done
for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in
israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them
known to their children
that the generation to come might know them even the children
which should be born who should arise and declare them to their
children
that they might set their hope in god and not forget the works
of god but keep his commandments
and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious
generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose
spirit was not stedfast with god
the children of ephraim being armed and carrying bows turned
back in the day of battle
they kept not the covenant of god and refused to walk in his
law
and forgat his works and his wonders that he had shewed them
marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the
land of egypt in the field of zoan
he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made
the waters to stand as an heap
in the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night
with a light of fire
he clave the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out
of the great depths
he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to
run down like rivers
and they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most high
in the wilderness
and they tempted god in their heart by asking meat for their
lust
yea they spake against god they said can god furnish a table
in the wilderness
behold he smote the rock that the waters gushed out and the
streams overflowed can he give bread also can he provide flesh for
his people
therefore the lord heard this and was wroth so a fire was
kindled against jacob and anger also came up against israel
because they believed not in god and trusted not in his
salvation
though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the
doors of heaven
and had rained down manna upon them to eat and had given them
of the corn of heaven
man did eat angels food he sent them meat to the full
he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven and by his power
he brought in the south wind
he rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls like
as the sand of the sea
and he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their
habitations
so they did eat and were well filled for he gave them their
own desire
they were not estranged from their lust but while their meat
was yet in their mouths
the wrath of god came upon them and slew the fattest of them
and smote down the chosen men of israel
for all this they sinned still and believed not for his
wondrous works
therefore their days did he consume in vanity and their years
in trouble
when he slew them then they sought him and they returned and
enquired early after god
and they remembered that god was their rock and the high god
their redeemer
nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and they
lied unto him with their tongues
for their heart was not right with him neither were they
stedfast in his covenant
but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity and
destroyed them not yea many a time turned he his anger away and did
not stir up all his wrath
for he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth
away and cometh not again
how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him
in the desert
yea they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one
of israel
they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them
from the enemy
how he had wrought his signs in egypt and his wonders in the
field of zoan
and had turned their rivers into blood and their floods that
they could not drink
he sent divers sorts of flies among them which devoured them
and frogs which destroyed them
he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller and their
labour unto the locust
he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycomore trees
with frost
he gave up their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to
hot thunderbolts
he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and
indignation and trouble by sending evil angels among them
he made a way to his anger he spared not their soul from death
but gave their life over to the pestilence
and smote all the firstborn in egypt the chief of their
strength in the tabernacles of ham
but made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them
in the wilderness like a flock
and he led them on safely so that they feared not but the sea
overwhelmed their enemies
and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary even to this
mountain which his right hand had purchased
he cast out the heathen also before them and divided them an
inheritance by line and made the tribes of israel to dwell in their
tents
yet they tempted and provoked the most high god and kept not
his testimonies
but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers they
were turned aside like a deceitful bow
for they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved
him to jealousy with their graven images
when god heard this he was wroth and greatly abhorred israel
so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tent which he
placed among men
and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into
the enemys hand
he gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with
his inheritance
the fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not
given to marriage
their priests fell by the sword and their widows made no
lamentation
then the lord awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty man
that shouteth by reason of wine
and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts he put them to a
perpetual reproach
moreover he refused the tabernacle of joseph and chose not the
tribe of ephraim
but chose the tribe of judah the mount zion which he loved
and he built his sanctuary like high palaces like the earth
which he hath established for ever
he chose david also his servant and took him from the
sheepfolds
from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed
jacob his people and israel his inheritance
so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart and
guided them by the skilfulness of his hands
o god the heathen are come into thine inheritance thy holy
temple have they defiled they have laid jerusalem on heaps
the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto
the fowls of the heaven the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of
the earth
their blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem and
there was none to bury them
we are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derision
to them that are round about us
how long lord wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy jealousy
burn like fire
pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee and
upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name
for they have devoured jacob and laid waste his dwelling place
o remember not against us former iniquities let thy tender
mercies speedily prevent us for we are brought very low
help us o god of our salvation for the glory of thy name and
deliver us and purge away our sins for thy names sake
wherefore should the heathen say where is their god let him be
known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of
thy servants which is shed
let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according to
the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to
die
and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their
reproach wherewith they have reproached thee o lord
so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks
for ever we will shew forth thy praise to all generations
give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadest joseph like a
flock thou that dwellest between the cherubims shine forth
before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strength
and come and save us
turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shall
be saved
o lord god of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the
prayer of thy people
thou feedest them with the bread of tears and givest them tears
to drink in great measure
thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours and our enemies
laugh among themselves
turn us again o god of hosts and cause thy face to shine and
we shall be saved
thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou hast cast out the
heathen and planted it
thou preparedst room before it and didst cause it to take deep
root and it filled the land
the hills were covered with the shadow of it and the boughs
thereof were like the goodly cedars
she sent out her boughs unto the sea and her branches unto the
river
why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all they
which pass by the way do pluck her
the boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast of
the field doth devour it
return we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heaven
and behold and visit this vine
and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the
branch that thou madest strong for thyself
it is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the
rebuke of thy countenance
let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of
man whom thou madest strong for thyself
so will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call
upon thy name
turn us again o lord god of hosts cause thy face to shine and
we shall be saved
sing aloud unto god our strength make a joyful noise unto the
god of jacob
take a psalm and bring hither the timbrel the pleasant harp
with the psaltery
blow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on
our solemn feast day
for this was a statute for israel and a law of the god of jacob
this he ordained in joseph for a testimony when he went out
through the land of egypt where i heard a language that i understood
not
i removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were delivered
from the pots
thou calledst in trouble and i delivered thee i answered thee
in the secret place of thunder i proved thee at the waters of
meribah
selah
hear o my people and i will testify unto thee o israel if
thou wilt hearken unto me
there shall no strange god be in thee neither shalt thou worship
any strange god
i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of
egypt open thy mouth wide and i will fill it
but my people would not hearken to my voice and israel would
none of me
so i gave them up unto their own hearts lust and they walked
in their own counsels
oh that my people had hearkened unto me and israel had walked
in my ways
i should soon have subdued their enemies and turned my hand
against their adversaries
the haters of the lord should have submitted themselves unto
him but their time should have endured for ever
he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and
with honey out of the rock should i have satisfied thee
god standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among
the gods
how long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the
wicked selah
defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and
needy
deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the
wicked
they know not neither will they understand they walk on in
darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course
i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most
high
but ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes
arise o god judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all
nations
keep not thou silence o god hold not thy peace and be not
still o god
for lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee
have lifted up the head
they have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted
against thy hidden ones
they have said come and let us cut them off from being a
nation that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance
for they have consulted together with one consent they are
confederate against thee
the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the
hagarenes
gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines with the
inhabitants of tyre
assur also is joined with them they have holpen the children of
lot
selah
do unto them as unto the midianites as to sisera as to jabin
at the brook of kison
which perished at endor they became as dung for the earth
make their nobles like oreb and like zeeb yea all their
princes as zebah and as zalmunna
who said let us take to ourselves the houses of god in
possession
o my god make them like a wheel as the stubble before the
wind
as the fire burneth a wood and as the flame setteth the
mountains on fire
so persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with
thy storm
fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name o
lord
let them be confounded and troubled for ever yea let them be
put to shame and perish
that men may know that thou whose name alone is jehovah art
the most high over all the earth
how amiable are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts
my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord
my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living god
yea the sparrow hath found an house and the swallow a nest for
herself where she may lay her young even thine altars o lord of
hosts my king and my god
blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still
praising thee selah
blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are
the ways of them
who passing through the valley of baca make it a well the rain
also filleth the pools
they go from strength to strength every one of them in zion
appeareth before god
o lord god of hosts hear my prayer give ear o god of jacob
selah
behold o god our shield and look upon the face of thine
anointed
for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand i had rather
be a doorkeeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of
wickedness
for the lord god is a sun and shield the lord will give grace
and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
uprightly
o lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee
lord thou hast been favourable unto thy land thou hast brought
back the captivity of jacob
thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou hast covered
all their sin selah
thou hast taken away all thy wrath thou hast turned thyself from
the fierceness of thine anger
turn us o god of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us
to cease
wilt thou be angry with us for ever wilt thou draw out thine
anger to all generations
wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in
thee
shew us thy mercy o lord and grant us thy salvation
i will hear what god the lord will speak for he will speak peace
unto his people and to his saints but let them not turn again to
folly
surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that glory may
dwell in our land
mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have
kissed each other
truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall
look down from heaven
yea the lord shall give that which is good and our land shall
yield her increase
righteousness shall go before him and shall set us in the way
of his steps
bow down thine ear o lord hear me for i am poor and needy
preserve my soul for i am holy o thou my god save thy servant
that trusteth in thee
be merciful unto me o lord for i cry unto thee daily
rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee o lord do i lift
up my soul
for thou lord art good and ready to forgive and plenteous in
mercy unto all them that call upon thee
give ear o lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my
supplications
in the day of my trouble i will call upon thee for thou wilt
answer me
among the gods there is none like unto thee o lord neither are
there any works like unto thy works
all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before
thee o lord and shall glorify thy name
for thou art great and doest wondrous things thou art god
alone
teach me thy way o lord i will walk in thy truth unite my
heart to fear thy name
i will praise thee o lord my god with all my heart and i will
glorify thy name for evermore
for great is thy mercy toward me and thou hast delivered my
soul from the lowest hell
o god the proud are risen against me and the assemblies of
violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before
them
but thou o lord art a god full of compassion and gracious
long suffering and plenteous in mercy and truth
o turn unto me and have mercy upon me give thy strength unto
thy servant and save the son of thine handmaid
shew me a token for good that they which hate me may see it
and be ashamed because thou lord hast holpen me and comforted me
his foundation is in the holy mountains
the lord loveth the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of
jacob
glorious things are spoken of thee o city of god selah
i will make mention of rahab and babylon to them that know me
behold philistia and tyre with ethiopia this man was born there
and of zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her
and the highest himself shall establish her
the lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this
man was born there selah
as well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there
all my springs are in thee
o lord god of my salvation i have cried day and night before
thee
let my prayer come before thee incline thine ear unto my cry
for my soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh unto
the grave
i am counted with them that go down into the pit i am as a man
that hath no strength
free among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave whom
thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand
thou hast laid me in the lowest pit in darkness in the deeps
thy wrath lieth hard upon me and thou hast afflicted me with all
thy waves selah
thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me thou hast made
me an abomination unto them i am shut up and i cannot come forth
mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction lord i have called
daily upon thee i have stretched out my hands unto thee
wilt thou shew wonders to the dead shall the dead arise and
praise thee selah
shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave or thy
faithfulness in destruction
shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy righteousness in
the land of forgetfulness
but unto thee have i cried o lord and in the morning shall my
prayer prevent thee
lord why castest thou off my soul why hidest thou thy face
from me
i am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up while i suffer
thy terrors i am distracted
thy fierce wrath goeth over me thy terrors have cut me off
they came round about me daily like water they compassed me
about together
lover and friend hast thou put far from me and mine
acquaintance into darkness
i will sing of the mercies of the lord for ever with my mouth
will i make known thy faithfulness to all generations
for i have said mercy shall be built up for ever thy
faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens
i have made a covenant with my chosen i have sworn unto david my
servant
thy seed will i establish for ever and build up thy throne to
all generations selah
and the heavens shall praise thy wonders o lord thy
faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints
for who in the heaven can be compared unto the lord who among
the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the lord
god is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to
be had in reverence of all them that are about him
o lord god of hosts who is a strong lord like unto thee or to
thy faithfulness round about thee
thou rulest the raging of the sea when the waves thereof arise
thou stillest them
thou hast broken rahab in pieces as one that is slain thou
hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm
the heavens are thine the earth also is thine as for the world
and the fulness thereof thou hast founded them
the north and the south thou hast created them tabor and hermon
shall rejoice in thy name
thou hast a mighty arm strong is thy hand and high is thy
right hand
justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne mercy and
truth shall go before thy face
blessed is the people that know the joyful sound they shall
walk o lord in the light of thy countenance
in thy name shall they rejoice all the day and in thy
righteousness shall they be exalted
for thou art the glory of their strength and in thy favour our
horn shall be exalted
for the lord is our defence and the holy one of israel is our
king
then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one and saidst i have
laid help upon one that is mighty i have exalted one chosen out of
the people
i have found david my servant with my holy oil have i anointed
him
with whom my hand shall be established mine arm also shall
strengthen him
the enemy shall not exact upon him nor the son of wickedness
afflict him
and i will beat down his foes before his face and plague them
that hate him
but my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him and in my
name shall his horn be exalted
i will set his hand also in the sea and his right hand in the
rivers
he shall cry unto me thou art my father my god and the rock
of my salvation
also i will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the
earth
my mercy will i keep for him for evermore and my covenant shall
stand fast with him
his seed also will i make to endure for ever and his throne as
the days of heaven
if his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments
if they break my statutes and keep not my commandments
then will i visit their transgression with the rod and their
iniquity with stripes
nevertheless my lovingkindness will i not utterly take from him
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail
my covenant will i not break nor alter the thing that is gone
out of my lips
once have i sworn by my holiness that i will not lie unto david
his seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before
me
it shall be established for ever as the moon and as a faithful
witness in heaven selah
but thou hast cast off and abhorred thou hast been wroth with
thine anointed
thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant thou hast
profaned his crown by casting it to the ground
thou hast broken down all his hedges thou hast brought his
strong holds to ruin
all that pass by the way spoil him he is a reproach to his
neighbours
thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries thou hast
made all his enemies to rejoice
thou hast also turned the edge of his sword and hast not made
him to stand in the battle
thou hast made his glory to cease and cast his throne down to
the ground
the days of his youth hast thou shortened thou hast covered him
with shame selah
how long lord wilt thou hide thyself for ever shall thy wrath
burn like fire
remember how short my time is wherefore hast thou made all men
in vain
what man is he that liveth and shall not see death shall he
deliver his soul from the hand of the grave selah
lord where are thy former lovingkindnesses which thou swarest
unto david in thy truth
remember lord the reproach of thy servants how i do bear in
my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people
wherewith thine enemies have reproached o lord wherewith they
have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed
blessed be the lord for evermore amen and amen
lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations
before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst
formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting
thou art god
thou turnest man to destruction and sayest return ye children
of men
for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is
past and as a watch in the night
thou carriest them away as with a flood they are as a sleep in
the morning they are like grass which groweth up
in the morning it flourisheth and groweth up in the evening it
is cut down and withereth
for we are consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath are we
troubled
thou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the
light of thy countenance
for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years
as a tale that is told
the days of our years are threescore years and ten and if by
reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength
labour and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away
who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy
fear so is thy wrath
so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts
unto wisdom
return o lord how long and let it repent thee concerning thy
servants
o satisfy us early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be
glad all our days
make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
us and the years wherein we have seen evil
let thy work appear unto thy servants and thy glory unto their
children
and let the beauty of the lord our god be upon us and establish
thou the work of our hands upon us yea the work of our hands
establish thou it
he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide
under the shadow of the almighty
i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god
in him will i trust
surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and
from the noisome pestilence
he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt
thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler
thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the
arrow that flieth by day
nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the
destruction that wasteth at noonday
a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right
hand but it shall not come nigh thee
only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the
wicked
because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the
most high thy habitation
there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come
nigh thy dwelling
for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in
all thy ways
they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot
against a stone
thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the
dragon shalt thou trample under feet
because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver
him i will set him on high because he hath known my name
he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him
in trouble i will deliver him and honour him
with long life will i satisfy him and shew him my salvation
it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord and to sing
praises unto thy name o most high
to shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning and thy
faithfulness every night
upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery upon
the harp with a solemn sound
for thou lord hast made me glad through thy work i will
triumph in the works of thy hands
o lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep
a brutish man knoweth not neither doth a fool understand this
when the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of
iniquity do flourish it is that they shall be destroyed for ever
but thou lord art most high for evermore
for lo thine enemies o lord for lo thine enemies shall
perish all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered
but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn i
shall be anointed with fresh oil
mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies and mine ears
shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me
the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow
like a cedar in lebanon
those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in
the courts of our god
they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat
and flourishing
to shew that the lord is upright he is my rock and there is no
unrighteousness in him
the lord reigneth he is clothed with majesty the lord is
clothed with strength wherewith he hath girded himself the world
also is stablished that it cannot be moved
thy throne is established of old thou art from everlasting
the floods have lifted up o lord the floods have lifted up
their voice the floods lift up their waves
the lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters yea
than the mighty waves of the sea
thy testimonies are very sure holiness becometh thine house o
lord for ever
o lord god to whom vengeance belongeth o god to whom vengeance
belongeth shew thyself
lift up thyself thou judge of the earth render a reward to the
proud
lord how long shall the wicked how long shall the wicked
triumph
how long shall they utter and speak hard things and all the
workers of iniquity boast themselves
they break in pieces thy people o lord and afflict thine
heritage
they slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless
yet they say the lord shall not see neither shall the god of
jacob regard it
understand ye brutish among the people and ye fools when will
ye be wise
he that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the
eye shall he not see
he that chastiseth the heathen shall not he correct he that
teacheth man knowledge shall not he know
the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity
blessed is the man whom thou chastenest o lord and teachest
him out of thy law
that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until
the pit be digged for the wicked
for the lord will not cast off his people neither will he
forsake his inheritance
but judgment shall return unto righteousness and all the
upright in heart shall follow it
who will rise up for me against the evildoers or who will stand
up for me against the workers of iniquity
unless the lord had been my help my soul had almost dwelt in
silence
when i said my foot slippeth thy mercy o lord held me up
in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
my soul
shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which
frameth mischief by a law
they gather themselves together against the soul of the
righteous and condemn the innocent blood
but the lord is my defence and my god is the rock of my refuge
and he shall bring upon them their own iniquity and shall cut
them off in their own wickedness yea the lord our god shall cut them
off
o come let us sing unto the lord let us make a joyful noise to
the rock of our salvation
let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a
joyful noise unto him with psalms
for the lord is a great god and a great king above all gods
in his hand are the deep places of the earth the strength of the
hills is his also
the sea is his and he made it and his hands formed the dry
land
o come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the lord
our maker
for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture and the
sheep of his hand to day if ye will hear his voice
harden not your heart as in the provocation and as in the day
of temptation in the wilderness
when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work
forty years long was i grieved with this generation and said
it is a people that do err in their heart and they have not known my
ways
unto whom i sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my
rest

earth

day to day

the trees of the wood rejoice

earth he shall judge the world with righteousness and the people

isles be glad thereof

presence of the lord of the whole earth

glory

themselves of idols worship him all ye gods

saints he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked

israel all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our god

mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land that they may
dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way he shall serve me
he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that
telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight
i will early destroy all the wicked of the land that i may cut
off all wicked doers from the city of the lord
hear my prayer o lord and let my cry come unto thee
hide not thy face from me in the day when i am in trouble
incline thine ear unto me in the day when i call answer me speedily
for my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burned as
an hearth
my heart is smitten and withered like grass so that i forget
to eat my bread
by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
skin
i am like a pelican of the wilderness i am like an owl of the
desert
i watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top
mine enemies reproach me all the day and they that are mad
against me are sworn against me
for i have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with
weeping
because of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou hast
lifted me up and cast me down
my days are like a shadow that declineth and i am withered
like grass
but thou o lord shall endure for ever and thy remembrance
unto all generations
thou shalt arise and have mercy upon zion for the time to
favour her yea the set time is come
for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favour the
dust thereof
so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord and all the
kings of the earth thy glory
when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his
glory
he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise
their prayer
this shall be written for the generation to come and the
people which shall be created shall praise the lord
for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary from
heaven did the lord behold the earth
to hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are
appointed to death
to declare the name of the lord in zion and his praise in
jerusalem
when the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to
serve the lord
he weakened my strength in the way he shortened my days
i said o my god take me not away in the midst of my days thy
years are throughout all generations
of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth and the
heavens are the work of thy hands
they shall perish but thou shalt endure yea all of them
shall wax old like a garment as a vesture shalt thou change them and
they shall be changed
but thou art the same and thy years shall have no end
the children of thy servants shall continue and their seed
shall be established before thee
bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his
holy name
bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits
who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy
diseases
who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with
lovingkindness and tender mercies
who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is
renewed like the eagles
the lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
oppressed
he made known his ways unto moses his acts unto the children of
israel
the lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous
in mercy
he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger for
ever
he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us
according to our iniquities
for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his
mercy toward them that fear him
as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our
transgressions from us
like as a father pitieth his children so the lord pitieth them
that fear him
for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust
as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so
he flourisheth
for the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place
thereof shall know it no more
but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting
upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto childrens
children
to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his
commandments to do them
the lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his
kingdom ruleth over all
bless the lord ye his angels that excel in strength that do
his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word
bless ye the lord all ye his hosts ye ministers of his that
do his pleasure
bless the lord all his works in all places of his dominion
bless the lord o my soul
bless the lord o my soul o lord my god thou art very great
thou art clothed with honour and majesty
who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who
stretchest out the heavens like a curtain
who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh
the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind
who maketh his angels spirits his ministers a flaming fire
who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be
removed for ever
thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment the waters
stood above the mountains
at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy thunder they hasted
away
they go up by the mountains they go down by the valleys unto
the place which thou hast founded for them
thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over that they
turn not again to cover the earth
he sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the
hills
they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses
quench their thirst
by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation
which sing among the branches
he watereth the hills from his chambers the earth is satisfied
with the fruit of thy works
he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the
service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth
and wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make his
face to shine and bread which strengtheneth mans heart
the trees of the lord are full of sap the cedars of lebanon
which he hath planted
where the birds make their nests as for the stork the fir
trees are her house
the high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks
for the conies
he appointed the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going
down
thou makest darkness and it is night wherein all the beasts
of the forest do creep forth
the young lions roar after their prey and seek their meat from
god
the sun ariseth they gather themselves together and lay them
down in their dens
man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
evening
o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made
them all the earth is full of thy riches
so is this great and wide sea wherein are things creeping
innumerable both small and great beasts
there go the ships there is that leviathan whom thou hast
made to play therein
these wait all upon thee that thou mayest give them their meat
in due season
that thou givest them they gather thou openest thine hand
they are filled with good
thou hidest thy face they are troubled thou takest away their
breath they die and return to their dust
thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou
renewest the face of the earth
the glory of the lord shall endure for ever the lord shall
rejoice in his works
he looketh on the earth and it trembleth he toucheth the
hills and they smoke
i will sing unto the lord as long as i live i will sing praise
to my god while i have my being
my meditation of him shall be sweet i will be glad in the
lord
let the sinners be consumed out of the earth and let the
wicked be no more bless thou the lord o my soul praise ye the lord
o give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his
deeds among the people
sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous
works
glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that
seek the lord
seek the lord and his strength seek his face evermore
remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders
and the judgments of his mouth
o ye seed of abraham his servant ye children of jacob his
chosen
he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth
he hath remembered his covenant for ever the word which he
commanded to a thousand generations
which covenant he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac
and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law and to israel for
an everlasting covenant
saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of
your inheritance
when they were but a few men in number yea very few and
strangers in it
when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to
another people
he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for
their sakes
saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm
moreover he called for a famine upon the land he brake the
whole staff of bread
he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a
servant
whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron
until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried
him
the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and
let him go free
he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance
to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his senators
wisdom
israel also came into egypt and jacob sojourned in the land of
ham
and he increased his people greatly and made them stronger
than their enemies
he turned their heart to hate his people to deal subtilly with
his servants
he sent moses his servant and aaron whom he had chosen
they shewed his signs among them and wonders in the land of
ham
he sent darkness and made it dark and they rebelled not
against his word
he turned their waters into blood and slew their fish
their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of
their kings
he spake and there came divers sorts of flies and lice in all
their coasts
he gave them hail for rain and flaming fire in their land
he smote their vines also and their fig trees and brake the
trees of their coasts
he spake and the locusts came and caterpillers and that
without number
and did eat up all the herbs in their land and devoured the
fruit of their ground
he smote also all the firstborn in their land the chief of all
their strength
he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was
not one feeble person among their tribes
egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them fell
upon them
he spread a cloud for a covering and fire to give light in the
night
the people asked and he brought quails and satisfied them
with the bread of heaven
he opened the rock and the waters gushed out they ran in the
dry places like a river
for he remembered his holy promise and abraham his servant
and he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with
gladness
and gave them the lands of the heathen and they inherited the
labour of the people
that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws praise
ye the lord
praise ye the lord o give thanks unto the lord for he is good
for his mercy endureth for ever
who can utter the mighty acts of the lord who can shew forth
all his praise
blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth
righteousness at all times
remember me o lord with the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people o visit me with thy salvation
that i may see the good of thy chosen that i may rejoice in the
gladness of thy nation that i may glory with thine inheritance
we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we
have done wickedly
our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remembered
not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at
the red sea
nevertheless he saved them for his names sake that he might
make his mighty power to be known
he rebuked the red sea also and it was dried up so he led them
through the depths as through the wilderness
and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy
and the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them
left
then believed they his words they sang his praise
they soon forgat his works they waited not for his counsel
but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted god in
the desert
and he gave them their request but sent leanness into their
soul
they envied moses also in the camp and aaron the saint of the
lord
the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the
company of abiram
and a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up
the wicked
they made a calf in horeb and worshipped the molten image
thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that
eateth grass
they forgat god their saviour which had done great things in
egypt
wondrous works in the land of ham and terrible things by the
red sea
therefore he said that he would destroy them had not moses his
chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he
should destroy them
yea they despised the pleasant land they believed not his
word
but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice
of the lord
therefore he lifted up his hand against them to overthrow them
in the wilderness
to overthrow their seed also among the nations and to scatter
them in the lands
they joined themselves also unto baalpeor and ate the
sacrifices of the dead
thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and the
plague brake in upon them
then stood up phinehas and executed judgment and so the
plague was stayed
and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
generations for evermore
they angered him also at the waters of strife so that it went
ill with moses for their sakes
because they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedly
with his lips
they did not destroy the nations concerning whom the lord
commanded them
but were mingled among the heathen and learned their works
and they served their idols which were a snare unto them
yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
devils
and shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of
their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan and
the land was polluted with blood
thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring
with their own inventions
therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people
insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance
and he gave them into the hand of the heathen and they that
hated them ruled over them
their enemies also oppressed them and they were brought into
subjection under their hand
many times did he deliver them but they provoked him with
their counsel and were brought low for their iniquity
nevertheless he regarded their affliction when he heard their
cry
and he remembered for them his covenant and repented according
to the multitude of his mercies
he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
captives
save us o lord our god and gather us from among the heathen
to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praise
blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting to
everlasting and let all the people say amen praise ye the lord
o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy
endureth for ever
let the redeemed of the lord say so whom he hath redeemed from
the hand of the enemy
and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the
west from the north and from the south
they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no
city to dwell in
hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them
then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered
them out of their distresses
and he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a
city of habitation
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his
wonderful works to the children of men
for he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul
with goodness
such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound
in affliction and iron
because they rebelled against the words of god and contemned
the counsel of the most high
therefore he brought down their heart with labour they fell
down and there was none to help
then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he saved
them out of their distresses
he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and
brake their bands in sunder
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his
wonderful works to the children of men
for he hath broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron
in sunder
fools because of their transgression and because of their
iniquities are afflicted
their soul abhorreth all manner of meat and they draw near
unto the gates of death
then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth
them out of their distresses
he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from
their destructions
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his
wonderful works to the children of men
and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and
declare his works with rejoicing
they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in
great waters
these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep
for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth
up the waves thereof
they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths
their soul is melted because of trouble
they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are
at their wits end
then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth
them out of their distresses
he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are
still
then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them
unto their desired haven
oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his
wonderful works to the children of men
let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and
praise him in the assembly of the elders
he turneth rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into
dry ground
a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them
that dwell therein
he turneth the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground
into watersprings
and there he maketh the hungry to dwell that they may prepare
a city for habitation
and sow the fields and plant vineyards which may yield fruits
of increase
he blesseth them also so that they are multiplied greatly and
suffereth not their cattle to decrease
again they are minished and brought low through oppression
affliction and sorrow
he poureth contempt upon princes and causeth them to wander in
the wilderness where there is no way
yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him
families like a flock
the righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall
stop her mouth
whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall
understand the lovingkindness of the lord
o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise even with
my glory
awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early
i will praise thee o lord among the people and i will sing
praises unto thee among the nations
for thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth reacheth
unto the clouds
be thou exalted o god above the heavens and thy glory above
all the earth
that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and
answer me
god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide
shechem and mete out the valley of succoth
gilead is mine manasseh is mine ephraim also is the strength
of mine head judah is my lawgiver
moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe over
philistia will i triumph
who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into
edom
wilt not thou o god who hast cast us off and wilt not thou
o god go forth with our hosts
give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man
through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall
tread down our enemies
hold not thy peace o god of my praise
for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
opened against me they have spoken against me with a lying tongue
they compassed me about also with words of hatred and fought
against me without a cause
for my love they are my adversaries but i give myself unto
prayer
and they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love
set thou a wicked man over him and let satan stand at his right
hand
when he shall be judged let him be condemned and let his
prayer become sin
let his days be few and let another take his office
let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow
let his children be continually vagabonds and beg let them
seek their bread also out of their desolate places
let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the
strangers spoil his labour
let there be none to extend mercy unto him neither let there
be any to favour his fatherless children
let his posterity be cut off and in the generation following
let their name be blotted out
let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the lord
and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out
let them be before the lord continually that he may cut off
the memory of them from the earth
because that he remembered not to shew mercy but persecuted
the poor and needy man that he might even slay the broken in heart
as he loved cursing so let it come unto him as he delighted
not in blessing so let it be far from him
as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment so
let it come into his bowels like water and like oil into his bones
let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him and for a
girdle wherewith he is girded continually
let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the lord and
of them that speak evil against my soul
but do thou for me o god the lord for thy names sake
because thy mercy is good deliver thou me
for i am poor and needy and my heart is wounded within me
i am gone like the shadow when it declineth i am tossed up and
down as the locust
my knees are weak through fasting and my flesh faileth of
fatness
i became also a reproach unto them when they looked upon me
they shaked their heads
help me o lord my god o save me according to thy mercy
that they may know that this is thy hand that thou lord hast
done it
let them curse but bless thou when they arise let them be
ashamed but let thy servant rejoice
let mine adversaries be clothed with shame and let them cover
themselves with their own confusion as with a mantle
i will greatly praise the lord with my mouth yea i will
praise him among the multitude
for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor to save him
from those that condemn his soul
the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i
make thine enemies thy footstool
the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion rule
thou in the midst of thine enemies
thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power in the
beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dew
of thy youth
the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for
ever after the order of melchizedek
the lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day
of his wrath
he shall judge among the heathen he shall fill the places with
the dead bodies he shall wound the heads over many countries
he shall drink of the brook in the way therefore shall he lift
up the head
praise ye the lord i will praise the lord with my whole heart
in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation
the works of the lord are great sought out of all them that
have pleasure therein
his work is honourable and glorious and his righteousness
endureth for ever
he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered the lord is
gracious and full of compassion

evermore

lords name is to be praised

heavens
who is like unto the lord our god who dwelleth on high
who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven
and in the earth
he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth the needy
out of the dunghill
that he may set him with princes even with the princes of his
people
he maketh the barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful
mother of children praise ye the lord
when israel went out of egypt the house of jacob from a people
of strange language
judah was his sanctuary and israel his dominion
the sea saw it and fled jordan was driven back
the mountains skipped like rams and the little hills like
lambs
what ailed thee o thou sea that thou fleddest thou jordan
that thou wast driven back
ye mountains that ye skipped like rams and ye little hills
like lambs
tremble thou earth at the presence of the lord at the
presence of the god of jacob
which turned the rock into a standing water the flint into a
fountain of waters
not unto us o lord not unto us but unto thy name give glory
for thy mercy and for thy truths sake
wherefore should the heathen say where is now their god
but our god is in the heavens he hath done whatsoever he hath
pleased
their idols are silver and gold the work of mens hands
they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they
see not
they have ears but they hear not noses have they but they
smell not
they have hands but they handle not feet have they but they
walk not neither speak they through their throat
they that make them are like unto them so is every one that
trusteth in them
o israel trust thou in the lord he is their help and their
shield

shield

the lord shall increase you more and more you and your
children
ye are blessed of the lord which made heaven and earth
the heaven even the heavens are the lords but the earth
hath he given to the children of men

silence

evermore

me

i see my desire upon them that hate me
it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man
it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in
princes
all nations compassed me about but in the name of the lord
will i destroy them
they compassed me about yea they compassed me about but in
the name of the lord i will destroy them
they compassed me about like bees they are quenched as the
fire of thorns for in the name of the lord i will destroy them
thou hast thrust sore at me that i might fall but the lord
helped me
the lord is my strength and song and is become my salvation
the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
the righteous the right hand of the lord doeth valiantly

salvation
the stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
of the corner

be glad in it
save now i beseech thee o lord o lord i beseech thee send
now prosperity

from thy commandments

thee
blessed art thou o lord teach me thy statutes
with my lips have i declared all the judgments of thy mouth

all riches

ways

word

thy word

thy law

judgments at all times

thy word

statutes

of thy wondrous works

graciously

before me

my heart

unto the end

observe it with my whole heart
make me to go in the path of thy commandments for therein do i
delight

in thy way

righteousness

have hoped in thy judgments
so shall i keep thy law continually for ever and ever
and i will walk at liberty for i seek thy precepts
i will speak of thy testimonies also before kings and will not
be ashamed
and i will delight myself in thy commandments which i have
loved
my hands also will i lift up unto thy commandments which i
have loved and i will meditate in thy statutes
remember the word unto thy servant upon which thou hast caused
me to hope
this is my comfort in my affliction for thy word hath
quickened me
the proud have had me greatly in derision yet have i not
declined from thy law
i remembered thy judgments of old o lord and have comforted
myself
horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
forsake thy law
thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage
i have remembered thy name o lord in the night and have kept
thy law
this i had because i kept thy precepts
thou art my portion o lord i have said that i would keep thy
words
i intreated thy favour with my whole heart be merciful unto me
according to thy word
i thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies
i made haste and delayed not to keep thy commandments
the bands of the wicked have robbed me but i have not
forgotten thy law
at midnight i will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy
righteous judgments
i am a companion of all them that fear thee and of them that
keep thy precepts
the earth o lord is full of thy mercy teach me thy statutes
thou hast dealt well with thy servant o lord according unto
thy word
teach me good judgment and knowledge for i have believed thy
commandments
before i was afflicted i went astray but now have i kept thy
word
thou art good and doest good teach me thy statutes
the proud have forged a lie against me but i will keep thy
precepts with my whole heart
their heart is as fat as grease but i delight in thy law
it is good for me that i have been afflicted that i might
learn thy statutes
the law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
and silver
thy hands have made me and fashioned me give me understanding
that i may learn thy commandments
they that fear thee will be glad when they see me because i
have hoped in thy word
i know o lord that thy judgments are right and that thou in
faithfulness hast afflicted me
let i pray thee thy merciful kindness be for my comfort
according to thy word unto thy servant
let thy tender mercies come unto me that i may live for thy
law is my delight
let the proud be ashamed for they dealt perversely with me
without a cause but i will meditate in thy precepts
let those that fear thee turn unto me and those that have
known thy testimonies
let my heart be sound in thy statutes that i be not ashamed
my soul fainteth for thy salvation but i hope in thy word
mine eyes fail for thy word saying when wilt thou comfort me
for i am become like a bottle in the smoke yet do i not forget
thy statutes
how many are the days of thy servant when wilt thou execute
judgment on them that persecute me
the proud have digged pits for me which are not after thy law
all thy commandments are faithful they persecute me
wrongfully help thou me
they had almost consumed me upon earth but i forsook not thy
precepts
quicken me after thy lovingkindness so shall i keep the
testimony of thy mouth
for ever o lord thy word is settled in heaven
thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou hast established
the earth and it abideth

are thy servants
unless thy law had been my delights i should then have
perished in mine affliction
i will never forget thy precepts for with them thou hast
quickened me
i am thine save me for i have sought thy precepts
the wicked have waited for me to destroy me but i will
consider thy testimonies
i have seen an end of all perfection but thy commandment is
exceeding broad

enemies for they are ever with me
i have more understanding than all my teachers for thy
testimonies are my meditation
i understand more than the ancients because i keep thy
precepts
i have refrained my feet from every evil way that i might
keep thy word
i have not departed from thy judgments for thou hast taught
me
how sweet are thy words unto my taste yea sweeter than honey
to my mouth

every false way

righteous judgments

thy word

lord and teach me thy judgments

law

precepts

are the rejoicing of my heart
i have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway even
unto the end

not be ashamed of my hope

unto thy statutes continually

judgments

gold

them

understanding unto the simple
i opened my mouth and panted for i longed for thy
commandments

do unto those that love thy name

dominion over me

precepts
make thy face to shine upon thy servant and teach me thy
statutes
rivers of waters run down mine eyes because they keep not thy
law
righteous art thou o lord and upright are thy judgments
thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
very faithful
my zeal hath consumed me because mine enemies have forgotten
thy words
thy word is very pure therefore thy servant loveth it
i am small and despised yet do not i forget thy precepts
thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness and thy law
is the truth
trouble and anguish have taken hold on me yet thy
commandments are my delights
the righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting give me
understanding and i shall live
i cried with my whole heart hear me o lord i will keep thy
statutes
i cried unto thee save me and i shall keep thy testimonies
i prevented the dawning of the morning and cried i hoped in
thy word
mine eyes prevent the night watches that i might meditate in
thy word
hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness o lord
quicken me according to thy judgment
they draw nigh that follow after mischief they are far from
thy law
thou art near o lord and all thy commandments are truth
concerning thy testimonies i have known of old that thou hast
founded them for ever
consider mine affliction and deliver me for i do not forget
thy law
plead my cause and deliver me quicken me according to thy
word
salvation is far from the wicked for they seek not thy
statutes
great are thy tender mercies o lord quicken me according to
thy judgments
many are my persecutors and mine enemies yet do i not decline
from thy testimonies
i beheld the transgressors and was grieved because they kept
not thy word
consider how i love thy precepts quicken me o lord
according to thy lovingkindness
thy word is true from the beginning and every one of thy
righteous judgments endureth for ever
princes have persecuted me without a cause but my heart
standeth in awe of thy word
i rejoice at thy word as one that findeth great spoil
i hate and abhor lying but thy law do i love
seven times a day do i praise thee because of thy righteous
judgments
great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall
offend them
lord i have hoped for thy salvation and done thy
commandments
my soul hath kept thy testimonies and i love them
exceedingly
i have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies for all my ways
are before thee
let my cry come near before thee o lord give me
understanding according to thy word
let my supplication come before thee deliver me according to
thy word
my lips shall utter praise when thou hast taught me thy
statutes
my tongue shall speak of thy word for all thy commandments
are righteousness
let thine hand help me for i have chosen thy precepts
i have longed for thy salvation o lord and thy law is my
delight
let my soul live and it shall praise thee and let thy
judgments help me
i have gone astray like a lost sheep seek thy servant for i
do not forget thy commandments
in my distress i cried unto the lord and he heard me
deliver my soul o lord from lying lips and from a deceitful
tongue
what shall be given unto thee or what shall be done unto thee
thou false tongue
sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper
woe is me that i sojourn in mesech that i dwell in the tents
of kedar
my soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace
i am for peace but when i speak they are for war
i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my
help
my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth
he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee
will not slumber
behold he that keepeth israel shall neither slumber nor sleep
the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy shade upon thy right
hand
the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night
the lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve
thy soul
the lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
this time forth and even for evermore
i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of
the lord
our feet shall stand within thy gates o jerusalem
jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together
whither the tribes go up the tribes of the lord unto the
testimony of israel to give thanks unto the name of the lord
for there are set thrones of judgment the thrones of the house
of david
pray for the peace of jerusalem they shall prosper that love
thee
peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces
for my brethren and companions sakes i will now say peace be
within thee
because of the house of the lord our god i will seek thy good
unto thee lift i up mine eyes o thou that dwellest in the
heavens
behold as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
masters and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress so
our eyes wait upon the lord our god until that he have mercy upon us
have mercy upon us o lord have mercy upon us for we are
exceedingly filled with contempt
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
are at ease and with the contempt of the proud
if it had not been the lord who was on our side now may israel
say
if it had not been the lord who was on our side when men rose
up against us
then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was
kindled against us
then the waters had overwhelmed us the stream had gone over our
soul
then the proud waters had gone over our soul
blessed be the lord who hath not given us as a prey to their
teeth
our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers
the snare is broken and we are escaped
our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth
they that trust in the lord shall be as mount zion which cannot
be removed but abideth for ever
as the mountains are round about jerusalem so the lord is round
about his people from henceforth even for ever
for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
righteous lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity
do good o lord unto those that be good and to them that are
upright in their hearts
as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways the lord
shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity but peace shall be
upon israel
when the lord turned again the captivity of zion we were like
them that dream
then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with
singing then said they among the heathen the lord hath done great
things for them
the lord hath done great things for us whereof we are glad
turn again our captivity o lord as the streams in the south
they that sow in tears shall reap in joy
he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall
doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him
except the lord build the house they labour in vain that build
it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain
it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the
bread of sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep
lo children are an heritage of the lord and the fruit of the
womb is his reward
as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of
the youth
happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall
not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate
blessed is every one that feareth the lord that walketh in his
ways
for thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands happy shalt thou
be and it shall be well with thee
thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
house thy children like olive plants round about thy table
behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
lord
the lord shall bless thee out of zion and thou shalt see the
good of jerusalem all the days of thy life
yea thou shalt see thy childrens children and peace upon
israel
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth may israel now
say
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth yet they have
not prevailed against me
the plowers plowed upon my back they made long their furrows
the lord is righteous he hath cut asunder the cords of the
wicked
let them all be confounded and turned back that hate zion
let them be as the grass upon the housetops which withereth
afore it groweth up
wherewith the mower filleth not his hand nor he that bindeth
sheaves his bosom
neither do they which go by say the blessing of the lord be
upon you we bless you in the name of the lord
out of the depths have i cried unto thee o lord
lord hear my voice let thine ears be attentive to the voice of
my supplications
if thou lord shouldest mark iniquities o lord who shall
stand
but there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared
i wait for the lord my soul doth wait and in his word do i
hope
my soul waiteth for the lord more than they that watch for the
morning i say more than they that watch for the morning
let israel hope in the lord for with the lord there is mercy
and with him is plenteous redemption
and he shall redeem israel from all his iniquities
lord my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty neither do i
exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me
surely i have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is
weaned of his mother my soul is even as a weaned child
let israel hope in the lord from henceforth and for ever
lord remember david and all his afflictions
how he sware unto the lord and vowed unto the mighty god of
jacob
surely i will not come into the tabernacle of my house nor go
up into my bed
i will not give sleep to mine eyes or slumber to mine eyelids
until i find out a place for the lord an habitation for the
mighty god of jacob
lo we heard of it at ephratah we found it in the fields of the
wood
we will go into his tabernacles we will worship at his
footstool
arise o lord into thy rest thou and the ark of thy strength
let thy priests be clothed with righteousness and let thy
saints shout for joy
for thy servant davids sake turn not away the face of thine
anointed
the lord hath sworn in truth unto david he will not turn from
it of the fruit of thy body will i set upon thy throne
if thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that i
shall teach them their children shall also sit upon thy throne for
evermore
for the lord hath chosen zion he hath desired it for his
habitation
this is my rest for ever here will i dwell for i have desired
it
i will abundantly bless her provision i will satisfy her poor
with bread
i will also clothe her priests with salvation and her saints
shall shout aloud for joy
there will i make the horn of david to bud i have ordained a
lamp for mine anointed
his enemies will i clothe with shame but upon himself shall
his crown flourish
behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
together in unity
it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down
upon the beard even aarons beard that went down to the skirts of
his garments
as the dew of hermon and as the dew that descended upon the
mountains of zion for there the lord commanded the blessing even
life for evermore
behold bless ye the lord all ye servants of the lord which by
night stand in the house of the lord
lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the lord
the lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of zion
praise ye the lord praise ye the name of the lord praise him
o ye servants of the lord
ye that stand in the house of the lord in the courts of the
house of our god
praise the lord for the lord is good sing praises unto his
name for it is pleasant
for the lord hath chosen jacob unto himself and israel for his
peculiar treasure
for i know that the lord is great and that our lord is above
all gods
whatsoever the lord pleased that did he in heaven and in
earth in the seas and all deep places
he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he
maketh lightnings for the rain he bringeth the wind out of his
treasuries
who smote the firstborn of egypt both of man and beast
who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee o egypt
upon pharaoh and upon all his servants
who smote great nations and slew mighty kings
sihon king of the amorites and og king of bashan and all the
kingdoms of canaan
and gave their land for an heritage an heritage unto israel
his people
thy name o lord endureth for ever and thy memorial o lord
throughout all generations
for the lord will judge his people and he will repent himself
concerning his servants
the idols of the heathen are silver and gold the work of mens
hands
they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they
see not
they have ears but they hear not neither is there any breath
in their mouths
they that make them are like unto them so is every one that
trusteth in them
bless the lord o house of israel bless the lord o house of
aaron
bless the lord o house of levi ye that fear the lord bless
the lord
blessed be the lord out of zion which dwelleth at jerusalem
praise ye the lord
o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy
endureth for ever
o give thanks unto the god of gods for his mercy endureth for
ever
o give thanks to the lord of lords for his mercy endureth for
ever
to him who alone doeth great wonders for his mercy endureth for
ever
to him that by wisdom made the heavens for his mercy endureth
for ever
to him that stretched out the earth above the waters for his
mercy endureth for ever
to him that made great lights for his mercy endureth for ever
the sun to rule by day for his mercy endureth for ever
the moon and stars to rule by night for his mercy endureth for
ever
to him that smote egypt in their firstborn for his mercy
endureth for ever
and brought out israel from among them for his mercy endureth
for ever
with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm for his mercy
endureth for ever
to him which divided the red sea into parts for his mercy
endureth for ever
and made israel to pass through the midst of it for his mercy
endureth for ever
but overthrew pharaoh and his host in the red sea for his
mercy endureth for ever
to him which led his people through the wilderness for his
mercy endureth for ever
to him which smote great kings for his mercy endureth for
ever
and slew famous kings for his mercy endureth for ever
sihon king of the amorites for his mercy endureth for ever
and og the king of bashan for his mercy endureth for ever
and gave their land for an heritage for his mercy endureth for
ever
even an heritage unto israel his servant for his mercy
endureth for ever
who remembered us in our low estate for his mercy endureth for
ever
and hath redeemed us from our enemies for his mercy endureth
for ever
who giveth food to all flesh for his mercy endureth for ever
o give thanks unto the god of heaven for his mercy endureth
for ever
by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when
we remembered zion
we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof
for there they that carried us away captive required of us a
song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us
one of the songs of zion
how shall we sing the lords song in a strange land
if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her
cunning
if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of
my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy
remember o lord the children of edom in the day of jerusalem
who said rase it rase it even to the foundation thereof
o daughter of babylon who art to be destroyed happy shall he
be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us
happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
against the stones
i will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will i
sing praise unto thee
i will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for
thy lovingkindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word
above all thy name
in the day when i cried thou answeredst me and strengthenedst
me with strength in my soul
all the kings of the earth shall praise thee o lord when they
hear the words of thy mouth
yea they shall sing in the ways of the lord for great is the
glory of the lord
though the lord be high yet hath he respect unto the lowly but
the proud he knoweth afar off
though i walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou
shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and
thy right hand shall save me
the lord will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy o
lord endureth for ever forsake not the works of thine own hands
o lord thou hast searched me and known me
thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising thou
understandest my thought afar off
thou compassest my path and my lying down and art acquainted
with all my ways
for there is not a word in my tongue but lo o lord thou
knowest it altogether
thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon
me
such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot
attain unto it
whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from
thy presence
if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in
hell behold thou art there
if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost
parts of the sea
even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall
hold me
if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night
shall be light about me
yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth
as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee
for thou hast possessed my reins thou hast covered me in my
mothers womb
i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made
marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well
my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret
and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in
thy book all my members were written which in continuance were
fashioned when as yet there was none of them
how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is
the sum of them
if i should count them they are more in number than the sand
when i awake i am still with thee
surely thou wilt slay the wicked o god depart from me
therefore ye bloody men
for they speak against thee wickedly and thine enemies take
thy name in vain
do not i hate them o lord that hate thee and am not i
grieved with those that rise up against thee
i hate them with perfect hatred i count them mine enemies
search me o god and know my heart try me and know my
thoughts
and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the
way everlasting
deliver me o lord from the evil man preserve me from the
violent man
which imagine mischiefs in their heart continually are they
gathered together for war
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent adders poison
is under their lips selah
keep me o lord from the hands of the wicked preserve me from
the violent man who have purposed to overthrow my goings
the proud have hid a snare for me and cords they have spread a
net by the wayside they have set gins for me selah
i said unto the lord thou art my god hear the voice of my
supplications o lord
o god the lord the strength of my salvation thou hast covered
my head in the day of battle
grant not o lord the desires of the wicked further not his
wicked device lest they exalt themselves selah
as for the head of those that compass me about let the mischief
of their own lips cover them
let burning coals fall upon them let them be cast into the
fire into deep pits that they rise not up again
let not an evil speaker be established in the earth evil shall
hunt the violent man to overthrow him
i know that the lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted
and the right of the poor
surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name the
upright shall dwell in thy presence
lord i cry unto thee make haste unto me give ear unto my
voice when i cry unto thee
let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the
lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice
set a watch o lord before my mouth keep the door of my lips
incline not my heart to any evil thing to practise wicked works
with men that work iniquity and let me not eat of their dainties
let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness and let him
reprove me it shall be an excellent oil which shall not break my
head for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities
when their judges are overthrown in stony places they shall
hear my words for they are sweet
our bones are scattered at the graves mouth as when one
cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth
but mine eyes are unto thee o god the lord in thee is my
trust leave not my soul destitute
keep me from the snares which they have laid for me and the
gins of the workers of iniquity
let the wicked fall into their own nets whilst that i withal
escape
i cried unto the lord with my voice with my voice unto the lord
did i make my supplication
i poured out my complaint before him i shewed before him my
trouble
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me then thou knewest my
path
in the way wherein i walked have they privily laid a snare for me
i looked on my right hand and beheld but there was no man that
would know me refuge failed me no man cared for my soul
i cried unto thee o lord i said thou art my refuge and my
portion in the land of the living
attend unto my cry for i am brought very low deliver me from
my persecutors for they are stronger than i
bring my soul out of prison that i may praise thy name the
righteous shall compass me about for thou shalt deal bountifully with
me
hear my prayer o lord give ear to my supplications in thy
faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness
and enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he hath smitten my life
down to the ground he hath made me to dwell in darkness as those
that have been long dead
therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me
is desolate
i remember the days of old i meditate on all thy works i muse
on the work of thy hands
i stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul thirsteth after
thee as a thirsty land selah
hear me speedily o lord my spirit faileth hide not thy face
from me lest i be like unto them that go down into the pit
cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning for in thee
do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift
up my soul unto thee
deliver me o lord from mine enemies i flee unto thee to hide
me
teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is
good lead me into the land of uprightness
quicken me o lord for thy names sake for thy righteousness
sake bring my soul out of trouble
and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them
that afflict my soul for i am thy servant
blessed be the lord my strength which teacheth my hands to war
and my fingers to fight
my goodness and my fortress my high tower and my deliverer
my shield and he in whom i trust who subdueth my people under me
lord what is man that thou takest knowledge of him or the son
of man that thou makest account of him
man is like to vanity his days are as a shadow that passeth
away
bow thy heavens o lord and come down touch the mountains and
they shall smoke
cast forth lightning and scatter them shoot out thine arrows
and destroy them
send thine hand from above rid me and deliver me out of great
waters from the hand of strange children
whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right
hand of falsehood
i will sing a new song unto thee o god upon a psaltery and an
instrument of ten strings will i sing praises unto thee
it is he that giveth salvation unto kings who delivereth david
his servant from the hurtful sword
rid me and deliver me from the hand of strange children whose
mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of
falsehood
that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth that
our daughters may be as corner stones polished after the similitude
of a palace
that our garners may be full affording all manner of store
that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our
streets
that our oxen may be strong to labour that there be no
breaking in nor going out that there be no complaining in our
streets
happy is that people that is in such a case yea happy is
that people whose god is the lord
i will extol thee my god o king and i will bless thy name for
ever and ever
every day will i bless thee and i will praise thy name for ever
and ever
great is the lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness

the proverbs
the proverbs of solomon the son of david king of israel  to
know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding
to receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and
equity  to give subtilty to the simple to the young man knowledge
and discretion
a wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of
understanding shall attain unto wise counsels  to understand a
proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark
sayings
the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools
despise wisdom and instruction
my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the
law of thy mother  for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy
head and chains about thy neck
my son if sinners entice thee consent thou not
if they say come with us let us lay wait for blood let us lurk
privily for the innocent without cause  let us swallow them up
alive as the grave and whole as those that go down into the pit
we shall find all precious substance we shall fill our houses
with spoil  cast in thy lot among us let us all have one purse
my son walk not thou in the way with them refrain thy foot from
their path  for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed
blood
surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird
and they lay wait for their own blood they lurk privily for
their own lives
so are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain which taketh
away the life of the owners thereof
wisdom crieth without she uttereth her voice in the streets
she crieth in the chief place of concourse in the openings of
the gates in the city she uttereth her words saying  how long
ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in
their scorning and fools hate knowledge   turn you at my
reproof behold i will pour out my spirit unto you i will make known
my words unto you
because i have called and ye refused i have stretched out my
hand and no man regarded  but ye have set at nought all my
counsel and would none of my reproof  i also will laugh at your
calamity i will mock when your fear cometh  when your fear
cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when
distress and anguish cometh upon you
then shall they call upon me but i will not answer they shall
seek me early but they shall not find me  for that they hated
knowledge and did not choose the fear of the lord  they would
none of my counsel they despised all my reproof
therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be
filled with their own devices
for the turning away of the simple shall slay them and the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them
but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and shall be
quiet from fear of evil
my son if thou wilt receive my words and hide my commandments
with thee  so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply
thine heart to understanding  yea if thou criest after knowledge
and liftest up thy voice for understanding  if thou seekest her as
silver and searchest for her as for hid treasures  then shalt
thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god
for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
understanding
he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to
them that walk uprightly
he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his
saints
then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and
equity yea every good path
when wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant
unto thy soul  discretion shall preserve thee understanding
shall keep thee  to deliver thee from the way of the evil man
from the man that speaketh froward things  who leave the paths of
uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness  who rejoice to do
evil and delight in the frowardness of the wicked  whose ways
are crooked and they froward in their paths  to deliver thee
from the strange woman even from the stranger which flattereth with
her words  which forsaketh the guide of her youth and forgetteth
the covenant of her god
for her house inclineth unto death and her paths unto the dead
none that go unto her return again neither take they hold of the
paths of life
that thou mayest walk in the way of good men and keep the paths
of the righteous
for the upright shall dwell in the land and the perfect shall
remain in it
but the wicked shall be cut off from the earth and the
transgressors shall be rooted out of it
my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my
commandments  for length of days and long life and peace shall
they add to thee
let not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck
write them upon the table of thine heart  so shalt thou find
favour and good understanding in the sight of god and man
trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine
own understanding
in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths
be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from
evil
it shall be health to thy navel and marrow to thy bones
honour the lord with thy substance and with the firstfruits of
all thine increase  so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and
thy presses shall burst out with new wine
my son despise not the chastening of the lord neither be weary
of his correction  for whom the lord loveth he correcteth even
as a father the son in whom he delighteth
happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth
understanding
for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
silver and the gain thereof than fine gold
she is more precious than rubies and all the things thou canst
desire are not to be compared unto her
length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches
and honour
her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace
she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy
is every one that retaineth her
the lord by wisdom hath founded the earth by understanding hath
he established the heavens
by his knowledge the depths are broken up and the clouds drop
down the dew
my son let not them depart from thine eyes keep sound wisdom
and discretion  so shall they be life unto thy soul and grace to
thy neck
then shalt thou walk in thy way safely and thy foot shall not
stumble
when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid yea thou shalt
lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet
be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the
wicked when it cometh
for the lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot
from being taken
withhold not good from them to whom it is due when it is in the
power of thine hand to do it
say not unto thy neighbour go and come again and to morrow i
will give when thou hast it by thee
devise not evil against thy neighbour seeing he dwelleth
securely by thee
strive not with a man without cause if he have done thee no
harm
envy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his ways
for the froward is abomination to the lord but his secret is
with the righteous
the curse of the lord is in the house of the wicked but he
blesseth the habitation of the just
surely he scorneth the scorners but he giveth grace unto the
lowly
the wise shall inherit glory but shame shall be the promotion of
fools
hear ye children the instruction of a father and attend to know
understanding
for i give you good doctrine forsake ye not my law
for i was my fathers son tender and only beloved in the sight of
my mother
he taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my
words keep my commandments and live
get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from
the words of my mouth
forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she
shall keep thee
wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all
thy getting get understanding
exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to
honour when thou dost embrace her
she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of
glory shall she deliver to thee
hear o my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life
shall be many
i have taught thee in the way of wisdom i have led thee in right
paths
when thou goest thy steps shall not be straitened and when thou
runnest thou shalt not stumble
take fast hold of instruction let her not go keep her for she
is thy life
enter not into the path of the wicked and go not in the way of
evil men
avoid it pass not by it turn from it and pass away
for they sleep not except they have done mischief and their
sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall
for they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of
violence
but the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth
more and more unto the perfect day
the way of the wicked is as darkness they know not at what they
stumble
my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings
let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of
thine heart
for they are life unto those that find them and health to all
their flesh
keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues
of life
put away from thee a froward mouth and perverse lips put far
from thee
let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight
before thee
ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established
turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from
evil
my son attend unto my wisdom and bow thine ear to my
understanding  that thou mayest regard discretion and that thy
lips may keep knowledge
for the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb and her
mouth is smoother than oil  but her end is bitter as wormwood
sharp as a twoedged sword
her feet go down to death her steps take hold on hell
lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life her ways are
moveable that thou canst not know them
hear me now therefore o ye children and depart not from the
words of my mouth
remove thy way far from her and come not nigh the door of her
house  lest thou give thine honour unto others and thy years unto
the cruel  lest strangers be filled with thy wealth and thy
labours be in the house of a stranger  and thou mourn at the
last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed  and say how have
i hated instruction and my heart despised reproof  and have not
obeyed the voice of my teachers nor inclined mine ear to them that
instructed me   i was almost in all evil in the midst of the
congregation and assembly
drink waters out of thine own cistern and running waters out of
thine own well
let thy fountains be dispersed abroad and rivers of waters in
the streets
let them be only thine own and not strangers with thee
let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy
youth
let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe let her breasts
satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with her love
and why wilt thou my son be ravished with a strange woman and
embrace the bosom of a stranger   for the ways of man are before
the eyes of the lord and he pondereth all his goings
his own iniquities shall take the wicked himself and he shall be
holden with the cords of his sins
he shall die without instruction and in the greatness of his
folly he shall go astray
my son if thou be surety for thy friend if thou hast stricken
thy hand with a stranger  thou art snared with the words of thy
mouth thou art taken with the words of thy mouth
do this now my son and deliver thyself when thou art come into
the hand of thy friend go humble thyself and make sure thy friend
give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eyelids
deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter and as a
bird from the hand of the fowler
go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise
which having no guide overseer or ruler  provideth her meat in
the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest
how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard when wilt thou arise out of
thy sleep   yet a little sleep a little slumber a little
folding of the hands to sleep  so shall thy poverty come as one
that travelleth and thy want as an armed man
a naughty person a wicked man walketh with a froward mouth
he winketh with his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teacheth
with his fingers  frowardness is in his heart he deviseth
mischief continually he soweth discord
therefore shall his calamity come suddenly suddenly shall he be
broken without remedy
these six things doth the lord hate yea seven are an
abomination unto him  a proud look a lying tongue and hands
that shed innocent blood  an heart that deviseth wicked
imaginations feet that be swift in running to mischief  a false
witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren
my son keep thy fathers commandment and forsake not the law of
thy mother  bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them
about thy neck
when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall
keep thee and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee
for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs
of instruction are the way of life  to keep thee from the evil
woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman
lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take
thee with her eyelids
for by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of
bread and the adultress will hunt for the precious life
can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned
can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned   so
he that goeth in to his neighbours wife whosoever toucheth her shall
not be innocent
men do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when
he is hungry  but if he be found he shall restore sevenfold he
shall give all the substance of his house
but whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding
he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul
a wound and dishonour shall he get and his reproach shall not be
wiped away
for jealousy is the rage of a man therefore he will not spare in
the day of vengeance
he will not regard any ransom neither will he rest content
though thou givest many gifts
my son keep my words and lay up my commandments with thee
keep my commandments and live and my law as the apple of thine
eye
bind them upon thy fingers write them upon the table of thine
heart
say unto wisdom thou art my sister and call understanding thy
kinswoman  that they may keep thee from the strange woman from
the stranger which flattereth with her words
for at the window of my house i looked through my casement
and beheld among the simple ones i discerned among the youths a
young man void of understanding  passing through the street near
her corner and he went the way to her house  in the twilight in
the evening in the black and dark night  and behold there met
him a woman with the attire of an harlot and subtil of heart
she is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house
now is she without now in the streets and lieth in wait at every
corner   so she caught him and kissed him and with an impudent
face said unto him  i have peace offerings with me this day have
i payed my vows
therefore came i forth to meet thee diligently to seek thy face
and i have found thee
i have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry with carved
works with fine linen of egypt
i have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon
come let us take our fill of love until the morning let us
solace ourselves with loves
for the goodman is not at home he is gone a long journey
he hath taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the day
appointed
with her much fair speech she caused him to yield with the
flattering of her lips she forced him
he goeth after her straightway as an ox goeth to the slaughter
or as a fool to the correction of the stocks  till a dart strike
through his liver as a bird hasteth to the snare and knoweth not
that it is for his life
hearken unto me now therefore o ye children and attend to the
words of my mouth
let not thine heart decline to her ways go not astray in her
paths
for she hath cast down many wounded yea many strong men have
been slain by her
her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of
death
doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice
she standeth in the top of high places by the way in the places of
the paths
she crieth at the gates at the entry of the city at the coming
in at the doors
unto you o men i call and my voice is to the sons of man
o ye simple understand wisdom and ye fools be ye of an
understanding heart
hear for i will speak of excellent things and the opening of my
lips shall be right things
for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination
to my lips
all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing
froward or perverse in them
they are all plain to him that understandeth and right to them
that find knowledge
receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than
choice gold
for wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be
desired are not to be compared to it
i wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty
inventions
the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and
the evil way and the froward mouth do i hate
counsel is mine and sound wisdom i am understanding i have
strength
by me kings reign and princes decree justice
by me princes rule and nobles even all the judges of the earth
i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find
me
riches and honour are with me yea durable riches and
righteousness
my fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold and my revenue
than choice silver
i lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of
judgment  that i may cause those that love me to inherit
substance and i will fill their treasures
the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his
works of old
i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the
earth was
when there were no depths i was brought forth when there were
no fountains abounding with water
before the mountains were settled before the hills was i brought
forth  while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields
nor the highest part of the dust of the world
when he prepared the heavens i was there when he set a compass
upon the face of the depth  when he established the clouds above
when he strengthened the fountains of the deep  when he gave to
the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment
when he appointed the foundations of the earth  then i was by
him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight
rejoicing always before him  rejoicing in the habitable part of
his earth and my delights were with the sons of men
now therefore hearken unto me o ye children for blessed are
they that keep my ways
hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not
blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates
waiting at the posts of my doors
for whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favour of the
lord
but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all they
that hate me love death
wisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn out her seven
pillars  she hath killed her beasts she hath mingled her wine
she hath also furnished her table
she hath sent forth her maidens she crieth upon the highest
places of the city  whoso is simple let him turn in hither as
for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him  come eat of
my bread and drink of the wine which i have mingled
forsake the foolish and live and go in the way of understanding
he that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame and he that
rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot
reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and
he will love thee
give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a
just man and he will increase in learning
the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the
knowledge of the holy is understanding
for by me thy days shall be multiplied and the years of thy life
shall be increased
if thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou
scornest thou alone shalt bear it
a foolish woman is clamorous she is simple and knoweth nothing
for she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the high
places of the city  to call passengers who go right on their
ways  whoso is simple let him turn in hither and as for him
that wanteth understanding she saith to him  stolen waters are
sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant
but he knoweth not that the dead are there and that her guests
are in the depths of hell
the proverbs of solomon a wise son maketh a glad father but a
foolish son is the heaviness of his mother
treasures of wickedness profit nothing but righteousness
delivereth from death
the lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but
he casteth away the substance of the wicked
he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand but the hand of
the diligent maketh rich
he that gathereth in summer is a wise son but he that sleepeth
in harvest is a son that causeth shame
blessings are upon the head of the just but violence covereth
the mouth of the wicked
the memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked
shall rot
the wise in heart will receive commandments but a prating fool
shall fall
he that walketh uprightly walketh surely but he that perverteth
his ways shall be known
he that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow but a prating fool
shall fall
the mouth of a righteous man is a well of life but violence
covereth the mouth of the wicked
hatred stirreth up strifes but love covereth all sins
in the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found but
a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding
wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is near
destruction
the rich mans wealth is his strong city the destruction of the
poor is their poverty
the labour of the righteous tendeth to life the fruit of the
wicked to sin
he is in the way of life that keepeth instruction but he that
refuseth reproof erreth
he that hideth hatred with lying lips and he that uttereth a
slander is a fool
in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin but he that
refraineth his lips is wise
the tongue of the just is as choice silver the heart of the
wicked is little worth
the lips of the righteous feed many but fools die for want of
wisdom
the blessing of the lord it maketh rich and he addeth no
sorrow with it
it is as sport to a fool to do mischief but a man of
understanding hath wisdom
the fear of the wicked it shall come upon him but the desire
of the righteous shall be granted
as the whirlwind passeth so is the wicked no more but the
righteous is an everlasting foundation
as vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes so is the
sluggard to them that send him
the fear of the lord prolongeth days but the years of the
wicked shall be shortened
the hope of the righteous shall be gladness but the expectation
of the wicked shall perish
the way of the lord is strength to the upright but destruction
shall be to the workers of iniquity
the righteous shall never be removed but the wicked shall not
inhabit the earth
the mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom but the froward
tongue shall be cut out
the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable but the mouth
of the wicked speaketh frowardness
a false balance is abomination to the lord but a just weight is
his delight
when pride cometh then cometh shame but with the lowly is
wisdom
the integrity of the upright shall guide them but the
perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them
riches profit not in the day of wrath but righteousness
delivereth from death
the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way but the
wicked shall fall by his own wickedness
the righteousness of the upright shall deliver them but
transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness
when a wicked man dieth his expectation shall perish and the
hope of unjust men perisheth
the righteous is delivered out of trouble and the wicked cometh
in his stead
an hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour but through
knowledge shall the just be delivered
when it goeth well with the righteous the city rejoiceth and
when the wicked perish there is shouting
by the blessing of the upright the city is exalted but it is
overthrown by the mouth of the wicked
he that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour but a man of
understanding holdeth his peace
a talebearer revealeth secrets but he that is of a faithful
spirit concealeth the matter
where no counsel is the people fall but in the multitude of
counsellors there is safety
he that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it and he that
hateth suretiship is sure
a gracious woman retaineth honour and strong men retain riches
the merciful man doeth good to his own soul but he that is
cruel troubleth his own flesh
the wicked worketh a deceitful work but to him that soweth
righteousness shall be a sure reward
as righteousness tendeth to life so he that pursueth evil
pursueth it to his own death
they that are of a froward heart are abomination to the lord
but such as are upright in their way are his delight
though hand join in hand the wicked shall not be unpunished
but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered
as a jewel of gold in a swines snout so is a fair woman which
is without discretion
the desire of the righteous is only good but the expectation of
the wicked is wrath
there is that scattereth and yet increaseth and there is that
withholdeth more than is meet but it tendeth to poverty
the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall
be watered also himself
he that withholdeth corn the people shall curse him but
blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it
he that diligently seeketh good procureth favour but he that
seeketh mischief it shall come unto him
he that trusteth in his riches shall fall but the righteous
shall flourish as a branch
he that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind and the
fool shall be servant to the wise of heart
the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that
winneth souls is wise
behold the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth much
more the wicked and the sinner
whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge but he that hateth
reproof is brutish
a good man obtaineth favour of the lord but a man of wicked
devices will he condemn
a man shall not be established by wickedness but the root of the
righteous shall not be moved
a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh
ashamed is as rottenness in his bones
the thoughts of the righteous are right but the counsels of the
wicked are deceit
the words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood but the
mouth of the upright shall deliver them
the wicked are overthrown and are not but the house of the
righteous shall stand
a man shall be commended according to his wisdom but he that is
of a perverse heart shall be despised
he that is despised and hath a servant is better than he that
honoureth himself and lacketh bread
a righteous man regardeth the life of his beast but the tender
mercies of the wicked are cruel
he that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread but he
that followeth vain persons is void of understanding
the wicked desireth the net of evil men but the root of the
righteous yieldeth fruit
the wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips but the
just shall come out of trouble
a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth
and the recompence of a mans hands shall be rendered unto him
the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that
hearkeneth unto counsel is wise
a fools wrath is presently known but a prudent man covereth
shame
he that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness but a false
witness deceit
there is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword but the
tongue of the wise is health
the lip of truth shall be established for ever but a lying
tongue is but for a moment
deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil but to the
counsellors of peace is joy
there shall no evil happen to the just but the wicked shall be
filled with mischief
lying lips are abomination to the lord but they that deal truly
are his delight
a prudent man concealeth knowledge but the heart of fools
proclaimeth foolishness
the hand of the diligent shall bear rule but the slothful shall
be under tribute
heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop but a good word
maketh it glad
the righteous is more excellent than his neighbour but the way
of the wicked seduceth them
the slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting but
the substance of a diligent man is precious
in the way of righteousness is life and in the pathway thereof
there is no death
a wise son heareth his fathers instruction but a scorner
heareth not rebuke
a man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth but the soul of
the transgressors shall eat violence
he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life but he that openeth
wide his lips shall have destruction
the soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing but the soul
of the diligent shall be made fat
a righteous man hateth lying but a wicked man is loathsome and
cometh to shame
righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way but
wickedness overthroweth the sinner
there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing there is
that maketh himself poor yet hath great riches
the ransom of a mans life are his riches but the poor heareth
not rebuke
the light of the righteous rejoiceth but the lamp of the wicked
shall be put out
only by pride cometh contention but with the well advised is
wisdom
wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished but he that
gathereth by labour shall increase
hope deferred maketh the heart sick but when the desire cometh
it is a tree of life
whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed but he that feareth
the commandment shall be rewarded
the law of the wise is a fountain of life to depart from the
snares of death
good understanding giveth favour but the way of transgressors
is hard
every prudent man dealeth with knowledge but a fool layeth open
his folly
a wicked messenger falleth into mischief but a faithful
ambassador is health
poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction but
he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured
the desire accomplished is sweet to the soul but it is
abomination to fools to depart from evil
he that walketh with wise men shall be wise but a companion of
fools shall be destroyed
evil pursueth sinners but to the righteous good shall be
repayed
a good man leaveth an inheritance to his childrens children
and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just
much food is in the tillage of the poor but there is that is
destroyed for want of judgment
he that spareth his rod hateth his son but he that loveth him
chasteneth him betimes
the righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul but the
belly of the wicked shall want
every wise woman buildeth her house but the foolish plucketh it
down with her hands
he that walketh in his uprightness feareth the lord but he that
is perverse in his ways despiseth him
in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride but the lips of
the wise shall preserve them
where no oxen are the crib is clean but much increase is by the
strength of the ox
a faithful witness will not lie but a false witness will utter
lies
a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not but knowledge is
easy unto him that understandeth
go from the presence of a foolish man when thou perceivest not
in him the lips of knowledge
the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way but the folly
of fools is deceit
fools make a mock at sin but among the righteous there is
favour
the heart knoweth his own bitterness and a stranger doth not
intermeddle with his joy
the house of the wicked shall be overthrown but the tabernacle
of the upright shall flourish
there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end
thereof are the ways of death
even in laughter the heart is sorrowful and the end of that
mirth is heaviness
the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways and a
good man shall be satisfied from himself
the simple believeth every word but the prudent man looketh
well to his going
a wise man feareth and departeth from evil but the fool
rageth and is confident
he that is soon angry dealeth foolishly and a man of wicked
devices is hated
the simple inherit folly but the prudent are crowned with
knowledge
the evil bow before the good and the wicked at the gates of the
righteous
the poor is hated even of his own neighbour but the rich hath
many friends
he that despiseth his neighbour sinneth but he that hath mercy
on the poor happy is he
do they not err that devise evil but mercy and truth shall be
to them that devise good
in all labour there is profit but the talk of the lips tendeth
only to penury
the crown of the wise is their riches but the foolishness of
fools is folly
a true witness delivereth souls but a deceitful witness
speaketh lies
in the fear of the lord is strong confidence and his children
shall have a place of refuge
the fear of the lord is a fountain of life to depart from the
snares of death
in the multitude of people is the kings honour but in the want
of people is the destruction of the prince
he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding but he that
is hasty of spirit exalteth folly
a sound heart is the life of the flesh but envy the rottenness
of the bones
he that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his maker but he that
honoureth him hath mercy on the poor
the wicked is driven away in his wickedness but the righteous
hath hope in his death
wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding but
that which is in the midst of fools is made known
righteousness exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any
people
the kings favour is toward a wise servant but his wrath is
against him that causeth shame
a soft answer turneth away wrath but grievous words stir up
anger
the tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright but the mouth of
fools poureth out foolishness
the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and
the good
a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is
a breach in the spirit
a fool despiseth his fathers instruction but he that regardeth
reproof is prudent
in the house of the righteous is much treasure but in the
revenues of the wicked is trouble
the lips of the wise disperse knowledge but the heart of the
foolish doeth not so
the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the lord but
the prayer of the upright is his delight
the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he
loveth him that followeth after righteousness
correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way and he
that hateth reproof shall die
hell and destruction are before the lord how much more then the
hearts of the children of men   a scorner loveth not one that
reproveth him neither will he go unto the wise
a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance but by sorrow of
the heart the spirit is broken
the heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge but
the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness
all the days of the afflicted are evil but he that is of a
merry heart hath a continual feast
better is little with the fear of the lord than great treasure
and trouble therewith
better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and
hatred therewith
a wrathful man stirreth up strife but he that is slow to anger
appeaseth strife
the way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns but the
way of the righteous is made plain
a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish man despiseth his
mother
folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom but a man of
understanding walketh uprightly
without counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitude
of counsellors they are established
a man hath joy by the answer of his mouth and a word spoken in
due season how good is it   the way of life is above to the
wise that he may depart from hell beneath
the lord will destroy the house of the proud but he will
establish the border of the widow
the thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the lord but
the words of the pure are pleasant words
he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house but he that
hateth gifts shall live
the heart of the righteous studieth to answer but the mouth of
the wicked poureth out evil things
the lord is far from the wicked but he heareth the prayer of
the righteous
the light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart and a good report
maketh the bones fat
the ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise
he that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul but he that
heareth reproof getteth understanding
the fear of the lord is the instruction of wisdom and before
honour is humility
the preparations of the heart in man and the answer of the
tongue is from the lord
all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the lord
weigheth the spirits
commit thy works unto the lord and thy thoughts shall be
established
the lord hath made all things for himself yea even the wicked
for the day of evil
every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the lord
though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunished
by mercy and truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the
lord men depart from evil
when a mans ways please the lord he maketh even his enemies to
be at peace with him
better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without
right
a mans heart deviseth his way but the lord directeth his steps
a divine sentence is in the lips of the king his mouth
transgresseth not in judgment
a just weight and balance are the lords all the weights of the
bag are his work
it is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness for the
throne is established by righteousness
righteous lips are the delight of kings and they love him that
speaketh right
the wrath of a king is as messengers of death but a wise man
will pacify it
in the light of the kings countenance is life and his favour
is as a cloud of the latter rain
how much better is it to get wisdom than gold and to get
understanding rather to be chosen than silver   the highway of
the upright is to depart from evil he that keepeth his way preserveth
his soul
pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before a
fall
better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly than to
divide the spoil with the proud
he that handleth a matter wisely shall find good and whoso
trusteth in the lord happy is he
the wise in heart shall be called prudent and the sweetness of
the lips increaseth learning
understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it but
the instruction of fools is folly
the heart of the wise teacheth his mouth and addeth learning to
his lips
pleasant words are as an honeycomb sweet to the soul and
health to the bones
there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end
thereof are the ways of death
he that laboureth laboureth for himself for his mouth craveth
it of him
an ungodly man diggeth up evil and in his lips there is as a
burning fire
a froward man soweth strife and a whisperer separateth chief
friends
a violent man enticeth his neighbour and leadeth him into the
way that is not good
he shutteth his eyes to devise froward things moving his lips
he bringeth evil to pass
the hoary head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of
righteousness
he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that
ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city
the lot is cast into the lap but the whole disposing thereof is
of the lord
better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith than an house
full of sacrifices with strife
a wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame and
shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren
the fining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but the
lord trieth the hearts
a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips and a liar giveth ear to
a naughty tongue
whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his maker and he that is glad
at calamities shall not be unpunished
childrens children are the crown of old men and the glory of
children are their fathers
excellent speech becometh not a fool much less do lying lips a
prince
a gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it
whithersoever it turneth it prospereth
he that covereth a transgression seeketh love but he that
repeateth a matter separateth very friends
a reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes
into a fool
an evil man seeketh only rebellion therefore a cruel messenger
shall be sent against him
let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man rather than a fool
in his folly
whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from his
house
the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water
therefore leave off contention before it be meddled with
he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the just
even they both are abomination to the lord
wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom
seeing he hath no heart to it   a friend loveth at all times
and a brother is born for adversity
a man void of understanding striketh hands and becometh surety
in the presence of his friend
he loveth transgression that loveth strife and he that exalteth
his gate seeketh destruction
he that hath a froward heart findeth no good and he that hath a
perverse tongue falleth into mischief
he that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow and the father
of a fool hath no joy
a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit
drieth the bones
a wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways
of judgment
wisdom is before him that hath understanding but the eyes of a
fool are in the ends of the earth
a foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her
that bare him
also to punish the just is not good nor to strike princes for
equity
he that hath knowledge spareth his words and a man of
understanding is of an excellent spirit
even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise and he
that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding
through desire a man having separated himself seeketh and
intermeddleth with all wisdom
a fool hath no delight in understanding but that his heart may
discover itself
when the wicked cometh then cometh also contempt and with
ignominy reproach
the words of a mans mouth are as deep waters and the wellspring
of wisdom as a flowing brook
it is not good to accept the person of the wicked to overthrow
the righteous in judgment
a fools lips enter into contention and his mouth calleth for
strokes
a fools mouth is his destruction and his lips are the snare of
his soul
the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into
the innermost parts of the belly
he also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a
great waster
the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth
into it and is safe
the rich mans wealth is his strong city and as an high wall in
his own conceit
before destruction the heart of man is haughty and before
honour is humility
he that answereth a matter before he heareth it it is folly and
shame unto him
the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded
spirit who can bear   the heart of the prudent getteth
knowledge and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge
a mans gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great
men
he that is first in his own cause seemeth just but his
neighbour cometh and searcheth him
the lot causeth contentions to cease and parteth between the
mighty
a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city and
their contentions are like the bars of a castle
a mans belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth
and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled
death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that
love it shall eat the fruit thereof
whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favour
of the lord
the poor useth intreaties but the rich answereth roughly
a man that hath friends must shew himself friendly and there is
a friend that sticketh closer than a brother
better is the poor that walketh in his integrity than he that is
perverse in his lips and is a fool
also that the soul be without knowledge it is not good and he
that hasteth with his feet sinneth
the foolishness of man perverteth his way and his heart fretteth
against the lord
wealth maketh many friends but the poor is separated from his
neighbour
a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh
lies shall not escape
many will intreat the favour of the prince and every man is a
friend to him that giveth gifts
all the brethren of the poor do hate him how much more do his
friends go far from him he pursueth them with words yet they are
wanting to him
he that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul he that keepeth
understanding shall find good
a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh
lies shall perish
delight is not seemly for a fool much less for a servant to
have rule over princes
the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and it is his glory
to pass over a transgression
the kings wrath is as the roaring of a lion but his favour is
as dew upon the grass
a foolish son is the calamity of his father and the contentions
of a wife are a continual dropping
house and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent
wife is from the lord
slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and an idle soul shall
suffer hunger
he that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul but he
that despiseth his ways shall die
he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the lord and that
which he hath given will he pay him again
chasten thy son while there is hope and let not thy soul spare
for his crying
a man of great wrath shall suffer punishment for if thou
deliver him yet thou must do it again
hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wise
in thy latter end
there are many devices in a mans heart nevertheless the
counsel of the lord that shall stand
the desire of a man is his kindness and a poor man is better
than a liar
the fear of the lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall
abide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil
a slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom and will not so
much as bring it to his mouth again
smite a scorner and the simple will beware and reprove one
that hath understanding and he will understand knowledge
he that wasteth his father and chaseth away his mother is a
son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach
cease my son to hear the instruction that causeth to err from
the words of knowledge
an ungodly witness scorneth judgment and the mouth of the
wicked devoureth iniquity
judgments are prepared for scorners and stripes for the back of
fools
wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is
deceived thereby is not wise
the fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion whoso provoketh
him to anger sinneth against his own soul
it is an honour for a man to cease from strife but every fool
will be meddling
the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold therefore shall
he beg in harvest and have nothing
counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of
understanding will draw it out
most men will proclaim every one his own goodness but a faithful
man who can find   the just man walketh in his integrity his
children are blessed after him
a king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all
evil with his eyes
who can say i have made my heart clean i am pure from my sin
divers weights and divers measures both of them are alike
abomination to the lord
even a child is known by his doings whether his work be pure
and whether it be right
the hearing ear and the seeing eye the lord hath made even
both of them
love not sleep lest thou come to poverty open thine eyes and
thou shalt be satisfied with bread
it is naught it is naught saith the buyer but when he is gone
his way then he boasteth
there is gold and a multitude of rubies but the lips of
knowledge are a precious jewel
take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take a
pledge of him for a strange woman
bread of deceit is sweet to a man but afterwards his mouth
shall be filled with gravel
every purpose is established by counsel and with good advice
make war
he that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets therefore
meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips
whoso curseth his father or his mother his lamp shall be put
out in obscure darkness
an inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning but the
end thereof shall not be blessed
say not thou i will recompense evil but wait on the lord and
he shall save thee
divers weights are an abomination unto the lord and a false
balance is not good
mans goings are of the lord how can a man then understand his
own way   it is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is
holy and after vows to make enquiry
a wise king scattereth the wicked and bringeth the wheel over
them
the spirit of man is the candle of the lord searching all the
inward parts of the belly
mercy and truth preserve the king and his throne is upholden by
mercy
the glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of old
men is the grey head
the blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil so do stripes the
inward parts of the belly
the kings heart is in the hand of the lord as the rivers of
water he turneth it whithersoever he will
every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the lord
pondereth the hearts
to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the lord than
sacrifice
an high look and a proud heart and the plowing of the wicked
is sin
the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness but of
every one that is hasty only to want
the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to
and fro of them that seek death
the robbery of the wicked shall destroy them because they refuse
to do judgment
the way of man is froward and strange but as for the pure his
work is right
it is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a
brawling woman in a wide house
the soul of the wicked desireth evil his neighbour findeth no
favour in his eyes
when the scorner is punished the simple is made wise and when
the wise is instructed he receiveth knowledge
the righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked
but god overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness
whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor he also shall
cry himself but shall not be heard
a gift in secret pacifieth anger and a reward in the bosom
strong wrath
it is joy to the just to do judgment but destruction shall be
to the workers of iniquity
the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall
remain in the congregation of the dead
he that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man he that loveth wine
and oil shall not be rich
the wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous and the
transgressor for the upright
it is better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentious
and an angry woman
there is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the
wise but a foolish man spendeth it up
he that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life
righteousness and honour
a wise man scaleth the city of the mighty and casteth down the
strength of the confidence thereof
whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
troubles
proud and haughty scorner is his name who dealeth in proud
wrath
the desire of the slothful killeth him for his hands refuse to
labour
he coveteth greedily all the day long but the righteous giveth
and spareth not
the sacrifice of the wicked is abomination how much more when
he bringeth it with a wicked mind   a false witness shall
perish but the man that heareth speaketh constantly
a wicked man hardeneth his face but as for the upright he
directeth his way
there is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the
lord
the horse is prepared against the day of battle but safety is
of the lord
a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving
favour rather than silver and gold
the rich and poor meet together the lord is the maker of them
all
a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the
simple pass on and are punished
by humility and the fear of the lord are riches and honour and
life
thorns and snares are in the way of the froward he that doth
keep his soul shall be far from them
train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he
will not depart from it
the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the
lender
he that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity and the rod of his
anger shall fail
he that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed for he giveth of
his bread to the poor
cast out the scorner and contention shall go out yea strife
and reproach shall cease
he that loveth pureness of heart for the grace of his lips the
king shall be his friend
the eyes of the lord preserve knowledge and he overthroweth the
words of the transgressor
the slothful man saith there is a lion without i shall be
slain in the streets
the mouth of strange women is a deep pit he that is abhorred of
the lord shall fall therein
foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of
correction shall drive it far from him
he that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches and he that
giveth to the rich shall surely come to want
bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise and apply
thine heart unto my knowledge
for it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee they
shall withal be fitted in thy lips
that thy trust may be in the lord i have made known to thee
this day even to thee
have not i written to thee excellent things in counsels and
knowledge  that i might make thee know the certainty of the
words of truth that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them
that send unto thee   rob not the poor because he is poor
neither oppress the afflicted in the gate  for the lord will
plead their cause and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them
make no friendship with an angry man and with a furious man
thou shalt not go  lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to
thy soul
be not thou one of them that strike hands or of them that are
sureties for debts
if thou hast nothing to pay why should he take away thy bed
from under thee   remove not the ancient landmark which thy
fathers have set
seest thou a man diligent in his business he shall stand before
kings he shall not stand before mean men
when thou sittest to eat with a ruler consider diligently what
is before thee  and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man
given to appetite
be not desirous of his dainties for they are deceitful meat
labour not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom
wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not for riches
certainly make themselves wings they fly away as an eagle toward
heaven
eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither
desire thou his dainty meats  for as he thinketh in his heart so
is he eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with
thee
the morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up and lose
thy sweet words
speak not in the ears of a fool for he will despise the wisdom
of thy words
remove not the old landmark and enter not into the fields of
the fatherless  for their redeemer is mighty he shall plead
their cause with thee
apply thine heart unto instruction and thine ears to the words
of knowledge
withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him
with the rod he shall not die
thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul
from hell
my son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even
mine
yea my reins shall rejoice when thy lips speak right things
let not thine heart envy sinners but be thou in the fear of the
lord all the day long
for surely there is an end and thine expectation shall not be
cut off
hear thou my son and be wise and guide thine heart in the
way
be not among winebibbers among riotous eaters of flesh
for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty and drowsiness
shall clothe a man with rags
hearken unto thy father that begat thee and despise not thy
mother when she is old
buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction
and understanding
the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that
begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him
thy father and thy mother shall be glad and she that bare thee
shall rejoice
my son give me thine heart and let thine eyes observe my ways
for a whore is a deep ditch and a strange woman is a narrow
pit
she also lieth in wait as for a prey and increaseth the
transgressors among men
who hath woe who hath sorrow who hath contentions who hath
babbling who hath wounds without cause who hath redness of eyes
they that tarry long at the wine they that go to seek mixed
wine
look not thou upon the wine when it is red when it giveth his
colour in the cup when it moveth itself aright
at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an
adder
thine eyes shall behold strange women and thine heart shall
utter perverse things
yea thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the
sea or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast
they have stricken me shalt thou say and i was not sick they
have beaten me and i felt it not when shall i awake i will seek it
yet again
be not thou envious against evil men neither desire to be with
them
for their heart studieth destruction and their lips talk of
mischief
through wisdom is an house builded and by understanding it is
established  and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with
all precious and pleasant riches
a wise man is strong yea a man of knowledge increaseth
strength
for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war and in multitude of
counsellors there is safety
wisdom is too high for a fool he openeth not his mouth in the
gate
he that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person
the thought of foolishness is sin and the scorner is an
abomination to men
if thou faint in the day of adversity thy strength is small
if thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death and
those that are ready to be slain  if thou sayest behold we
knew it not doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it and he
that keepeth thy soul doth not he know it and shall not he render to
every man according to his works   my son eat thou honey
because it is good and the honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste
so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul when thou
hast found it then there shall be a reward and thy expectation shall
not be cut off
lay not wait o wicked man against the dwelling of the
righteous spoil not his resting place  for a just man falleth
seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into
mischief
rejoice not when thine enemy falleth and let not thine heart be
glad when he stumbleth  lest the lord see it and it displease
him and he turn away his wrath from him
fret not thyself because of evil men neither be thou envious at
the wicked  for there shall be no reward to the evil man the
candle of the wicked shall be put out
my son fear thou the lord and the king and meddle not with
them that are given to change  for their calamity shall rise
suddenly and who knoweth the ruin of them both   these things
also belong to the wise it is not good to have respect of persons in
judgment
he that saith unto the wicked thou are righteous him shall the
people curse nations shall abhor him  but to them that rebuke
him shall be delight and a good blessing shall come upon them
every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer
prepare thy work without and make it fit for thyself in the
field and afterwards build thine house
be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause and
deceive not with thy lips
say not i will do so to him as he hath done to me i will
render to the man according to his work
i went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the
man void of understanding  and lo it was all grown over with
thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall
thereof was broken down
then i saw and considered it well i looked upon it and
received instruction
yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the
hands to sleep  so shall thy poverty come as one that
travelleth and thy want as an armed man
these are also proverbs of solomon which the men of hezekiah
king of judah copied out
it is the glory of god to conceal a thing but the honour of
kings is to search out a matter
the heaven for height and the earth for depth and the heart of
kings is unsearchable
take away the dross from the silver and there shall come forth a
vessel for the finer
take away the wicked from before the king and his throne shall
be established in righteousness
put not forth thyself in the presence of the king and stand not
in the place of great men  for better it is that it be said unto
thee come up hither than that thou shouldest be put lower in the
presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen
go not forth hastily to strive lest thou know not what to do in
the end thereof when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame
debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself and discover not a
secret to another  lest he that heareth it put thee to shame
and thine infamy turn not away
a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of
silver
as an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold so is a
wise reprover upon an obedient ear
as the cold of snow in the time of harvest so is a faithful
messenger to them that send him for he refresheth the soul of his
masters
whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind
without rain
by long forbearing is a prince persuaded and a soft tongue
breaketh the bone
hast thou found honey eat so much as is sufficient for thee
lest thou be filled therewith and vomit it
withdraw thy foot from thy neighbours house lest he be weary
of thee and so hate thee
a man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a
maul and a sword and a sharp arrow
confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a
broken tooth and a foot out of joint
as he that taketh away a garment in cold weather and as vinegar
upon nitre so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart
if thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat and if he be
thirsty give him water to drink  for thou shalt heap coals of
fire upon his head and the lord shall reward thee
the north wind driveth away rain so doth an angry countenance a
backbiting tongue
it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a
brawling woman and in a wide house
as cold waters to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far
country
a righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled
fountain and a corrupt spring
it is not good to eat much honey so for men to search their own
glory is not glory
he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is
broken down and without walls
as snow in summer and as rain in harvest so honour is not
seemly for a fool
as the bird by wandering as the swallow by flying so the curse
causeless shall not come
a whip for the horse a bridle for the ass and a rod for the
fools back
answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like
unto him
answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own
conceit
he that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the
feet and drinketh damage
the legs of the lame are not equal so is a parable in the mouth
of fools
as he that bindeth a stone in a sling so is he that giveth
honour to a fool
as a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parable
in the mouths of fools
the great god that formed all things both rewardeth the fool
and rewardeth transgressors
as a dog returneth to his vomit so a fool returneth to his
folly
seest thou a man wise in his own conceit there is more hope of
a fool than of him
the slothful man saith there is a lion in the way a lion is in
the streets
as the door turneth upon his hinges so doth the slothful upon
his bed
the slothful hideth his hand in his bosom it grieveth him to
bring it again to his mouth
the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can
render a reason
he that passeth by and meddleth with strife belonging not to
him is like one that taketh a dog by the ears
as a mad man who casteth firebrands arrows and death  so
is the man that deceiveth his neighbour and saith am not i in sport
where no wood is there the fire goeth out so where there is no
talebearer the strife ceaseth
as coals are to burning coals and wood to fire so is a
contentious man to kindle strife
the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into
the innermost parts of the belly
burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with
silver dross
he that hateth dissembleth with his lips and layeth up deceit
within him  when he speaketh fair believe him not for there
are seven abominations in his heart
whose hatred is covered by deceit his wickedness shall be
shewed before the whole congregation
whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein and he that rolleth a
stone it will return upon him
a lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it and a
flattering mouth worketh ruin
boast not thyself of to morrow for thou knowest not what a day
may bring forth
let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth a stranger
and not thine own lips
a stone is heavy and the sand weighty but a fools wrath is
heavier than them both
wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous but who is able to stand
before envy   open rebuke is better than secret love
faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy
are deceitful
the full soul loatheth an honeycomb but to the hungry soul every
bitter thing is sweet
as a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that
wandereth from his place
ointment and perfume rejoice the heart so doth the sweetness of
a mans friend by hearty counsel
thine own friend and thy fathers friend forsake not neither
go into thy brothers house in the day of thy calamity for better is
a neighbour that is near than a brother far off
my son be wise and make my heart glad that i may answer him
that reproacheth me
a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the
simple pass on and are punished
take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take a
pledge of him for a strange woman
he that blesseth his friend with a loud voice rising early in
the morning it shall be counted a curse to him
a continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman
are alike
whosoever hideth her hideth the wind and the ointment of his
right hand which bewrayeth itself
iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his
friend
whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof so he
that waiteth on his master shall be honoured
as in water face answereth to face so the heart of man to man
hell and destruction are never full so the eyes of man are
never satisfied
as the fining pot for silver and the furnace for gold so is a
man to his praise
though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a
pestle yet will not his foolishness depart from him
be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks and look well
to thy herds
for riches are not for ever and doth the crown endure to every
generation   the hay appeareth and the tender grass sheweth
itself and herbs of the mountains are gathered
the lambs are for thy clothing and the goats are the price of
the field
and thou shalt have goats milk enough for thy food for the
food of thy household and for the maintenance for thy maidens
the wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold
as a lion
for the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof but
by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be
prolonged
a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which
leaveth no food
they that forsake the law praise the wicked but such as keep the
law contend with them
evil men understand not judgment but they that seek the lord
understand all things
better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness than he that
is perverse in his ways though he be rich
whoso keepeth the law is a wise son but he that is a companion
of riotous men shameth his father
he that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance he
shall gather it for him that will pity the poor
he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law even his
prayer shall be abomination
whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way he
shall fall himself into his own pit but the upright shall have good
things in possession
the rich man is wise in his own conceit but the poor that hath
understanding searcheth him out
when righteous men do rejoice there is great glory but when
the wicked rise a man is hidden
he that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso
confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy
happy is the man that feareth alway but he that hardeneth his
heart shall fall into mischief
as a roaring lion and a ranging bear so is a wicked ruler over
the poor people
the prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor
but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days
a man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee
to the pit let no man stay him
whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved but he that is perverse
in his ways shall fall at once
he that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread but he that
followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough
a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that maketh
haste to be rich shall not be innocent
to have respect of persons is not good for for a piece of bread
that man will transgress
he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and considereth not
that poverty shall come upon him
he that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he
that flattereth with the tongue
whoso robbeth his father or his mother and saith it is no
transgression the same is the companion of a destroyer
he that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife but he that
putteth his trust in the lord shall be made fat
he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool but whoso walketh
wisely he shall be delivered
he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack but he that hideth
his eyes shall have many a curse
when the wicked rise men hide themselves but when they perish
the righteous increase
he that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly
be destroyed and that without remedy
when the righteous are in authority the people rejoice but when
the wicked beareth rule the people mourn
whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father but he that keepeth
company with harlots spendeth his substance
the king by judgment establisheth the land but he that receiveth
gifts overthroweth it
a man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet
in the transgression of an evil man there is a snare but the
righteous doth sing and rejoice
the righteous considereth the cause of the poor but the wicked
regardeth not to know it
scornful men bring a city into a snare but wise men turn away
wrath
if a wise man contendeth with a foolish man whether he rage or
laugh there is no rest
the bloodthirsty hate the upright but the just seek his soul
a fool uttereth all his mind but a wise man keepeth it in till
afterwards
if a ruler hearken to lies all his servants are wicked
the poor and the deceitful man meet together the lord
lighteneth both their eyes
the king that faithfully judgeth the poor his throne shall be
established for ever
the rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself
bringeth his mother to shame
when the wicked are multiplied transgression increaseth but
the righteous shall see their fall
correct thy son and he shall give thee rest yea he shall give
delight unto thy soul
where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth
the law happy is he
a servant will not be corrected by words for though he
understand he will not answer
seest thou a man that is hasty in his words there is more hope
of a fool than of him
he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall
have him become his son at the length
an angry man stirreth up strife and a furious man aboundeth in
transgression
a mans pride shall bring him low but honour shall uphold the
humble in spirit
whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul he heareth
cursing and bewrayeth it not
the fear of man bringeth a snare but whoso putteth his trust in
the lord shall be safe
many seek the rulers favour but every mans judgment cometh
from the lord
an unjust man is an abomination to the just and he that is
upright in the way is abomination to the wicked
the words of agur the son of jakeh even the prophecy the man
spake unto ithiel even unto ithiel and ucal  surely i am more
brutish than any man and have not the understanding of a man
i neither learned wisdom nor have the knowledge of the holy
who hath ascended up into heaven or descended who hath gathered
the wind in his fists who hath bound the waters in a garment who
hath established all the ends of the earth what is his name and what
is his sons name if thou canst tell   every word of god is
pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him
add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be
found a liar
two things have i required of thee deny me them not before i
die  remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty
nor riches feed me with food convenient for me  lest i be full
and deny thee and say who is the lord or lest i be poor and steal
and take the name of my god in vain
accuse not a servant unto his master lest he curse thee and
thou be found guilty
there is a generation that curseth their father and doth not
bless their mother
there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes and yet
is not washed from their filthiness
there is a generation o how lofty are their eyes and their
eyelids are lifted up
there is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw
teeth as knives to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy
from among men
the horseleach hath two daughters crying give give there are
three things that are never satisfied yea four things say not it is
enough  the grave and the barren womb the earth that is not
filled with water and the fire that saith not it is enough
the eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his
mother the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young
eagles shall eat it
there be three things which are too wonderful for me yea four
which i know not  the way of an eagle in the air the way of a
serpent upon a rock the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and
the way of a man with a maid
such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth
her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness
for three things the earth is disquieted and for four which it
cannot bear  for a servant when he reigneth and a fool when he
is filled with meat  for an odious woman when she is married
and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress
there be four things which are little upon the earth but they
are exceeding wise  the ants are a people not strong yet they
prepare their meat in the summer  the conies are but a feeble
folk yet make they their houses in the rocks  the locusts have
no king yet go they forth all of them by bands  the spider
taketh hold with her hands and is in kings palaces
there be three things which go well yea four are comely in
going  a lion which is strongest among beasts and turneth not
away for any  a greyhound an he goat also and a king against
whom there is no rising up
if thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself or if thou
hast thought evil lay thine hand upon thy mouth
surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter and the
wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood so the forcing of wrath
bringeth forth strife
the words of king lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught
him
what my son and what the son of my womb and what the son of
my vows   give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that
which destroyeth kings
it is not for kings o lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine
nor for princes strong drink  lest they drink and forget the
law and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted
give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto
those that be of heavy hearts
let him drink and forget his poverty and remember his misery no
more
open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are
appointed to destruction
open thy mouth judge righteously and plead the cause of the
poor and needy
who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above
rubies
the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her so that he
shall have no need of spoil
she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life
she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her
hands
she is like the merchants ships she bringeth her food from
afar
she riseth also while it is yet night and giveth meat to her
household and a portion to her maidens
she considereth a field and buyeth it with the fruit of her
hands she planteth a vineyard
she girdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms
she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth
not out by night
she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the
distaff
she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yea she reacheth forth
her hands to the needy
she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her
household are clothed with scarlet
she maketh herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk
and purple
her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the
elders of the land
she maketh fine linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles
unto the merchant
strength and honour are her clothing and she shall rejoice in
time to come
she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law
of kindness
she looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not
the bread of idleness
her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also
and he praiseth her
many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them
all
favour is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that
feareth the lord she shall be praised
give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise
her in the gates
ecclesiastes
or
the preacher
the words of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem
vanity of vanities saith the preacher vanity of vanities all is
vanity
what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the
sun   one generation passeth away and another generation cometh
but the earth abideth for ever
the sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to his
place where he arose
the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north
it whirleth about continually and the wind returneth again according
to his circuits
all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the
place from whence the rivers come thither they return again
all things are full of labour man cannot utter it the eye is not
satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing
the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that
which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing
under the sun
is there any thing whereof it may be said see this is new it
hath been already of old time which was before us
there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be
any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come
after
i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem
and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning
all things that are done under heaven this sore travail hath god
given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith
i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and
behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit
that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is
wanting cannot be numbered
i communed with mine own heart saying lo i am come to great
estate and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been
before me in jerusalem yea my heart had great experience of wisdom
and knowledge
and i gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and
folly i perceived that this also is vexation of spirit
for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth
knowledge increaseth sorrow
i said in mine heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth
therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanity
i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what doeth it   i
sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting mine
heart with wisdom and to lay hold on folly till i might see what was
that good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven
all the days of their life
i made me great works i builded me houses i planted me
vineyards  i made me gardens and orchards and i planted trees in
them of all kind of fruits  i made me pools of water to water
therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees  i got me servants
and maidens and had servants born in my house also i had great
possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in jerusalem
before me  i gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar
treasure of kings and of the provinces i gat me men singers and women
singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments
and that of all sorts
so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in
jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me
and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld
not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labour and
this was my portion of all my labour
then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on
the labour that i had laboured to do and behold all was vanity and
vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun
and i turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly for
what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hath
been already done
then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth
darkness
the wise mans eyes are in his head but the fool walketh in
darkness and i myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them
all
then said i in my heart as it happeneth to the fool so it
happeneth even to me and why was i then more wise then i said in my
heart that this also is vanity
for there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for
ever seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be
forgotten
and how dieth the wise man as the fool
therefore i hated life because the work that is wrought under
the sun is grievous unto me for all is vanity and vexation of spirit
yea i hated all my labour which i had taken under the sun
because i should leave it unto the man that shall be after me
and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet
shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have laboured and
wherein i have shewed myself wise under the sun this is also vanity
therefore i went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
labour which i took under the sun
for there is a man whose labour is in wisdom and in knowledge
and in equity yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he
leave it for his portion this also is vanity and a great evil
for what hath man of all his labour and of the vexation of his
heart wherein he hath laboured under the sun   for all his days
are sorrows and his travail grief yea his heart taketh not rest in
the night this is also vanity
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and
drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour this
also i saw that it was from the hand of god
for who can eat or who else can hasten hereunto more than i
for god giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom and
knowledge and joy but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and
to heap up that he may give to him that is good before god this also
is vanity and vexation of spirit
to every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose
under the heaven  a time to be born and a time to die a time to
plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted  a time to
kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build
up  a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a
time to dance  a time to cast away stones and a time to gather
stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from
embracing  a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and
a time to cast away  a time to rend and a time to sew a time to
keep silence and a time to speak  a time to love and a time to
hate a time of war and a time of peace
what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth
i have seen the travail which god hath given to the sons of men
to be exercised in it
he hath made every thing beautiful in his time also he hath set
the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that
god maketh from the beginning to the end
i know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoice
and to do good in his life
and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good
of all his labour it is the gift of god
i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be for ever nothing
can be put to it nor any thing taken from it and god doeth it that
men should fear before him
that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already
been and god requireth that which is past
and moreover i saw under the sun the place of judgment that
wickedness was there and the place of righteousness that iniquity
was there
i said in mine heart god shall judge the righteous and the
wicked for there is a time there for every purpose and for every
work
i said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men
that god might manifest them and that they might see that they
themselves are beasts
for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even
one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea
they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a
beast for all is vanity
all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust
again
who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit
of the beast that goeth downward to the earth   wherefore i
perceive that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice
in his own works for that is his portion for who shall bring him to
see what shall be after him   so i returned and considered all
the oppressions that are done under the sun and behold the tears of
such as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side of
their oppressors there was power but they had no comforter
wherefore i praised the dead which are already dead more than the
living which are yet alive
yea better is he than both they which hath not yet been who
hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun
again i considered all travail and every right work that for
this a man is envied of his neighbour this is also vanity and
vexation of spirit
the fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh
better is an handful with quietness than both the hands full with
travail and vexation of spirit
then i returned and i saw vanity under the sun
there is one alone and there is not a second yea he hath
neither child nor brother yet is there no end of all his labour
neither is his eye satisfied with riches neither saith he for whom
do i labour and bereave my soul of good this is also vanity yea it
is a sore travail
two are better than one because they have a good reward for their
labour
for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him
that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up
again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one
be warm alone   and if one prevail against him two shall
withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken
better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king
who will no more be admonished
for out of prison he cometh to reign whereas also he that is
born in his kingdom becometh poor
i considered all the living which walk under the sun with the
second child that shall stand up in his stead
there is no end of all the people even of all that have been
before them they also that come after shall not rejoice in him
surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit
keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of god and be more
ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider
not that they do evil
be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasty to
utter any thing before god for god is in heaven and thou upon earth
therefore let thy words be few
for a dream cometh through the multitude of business and a fools
voice is known by multitude of words
when thou vowest a vow unto god defer not to pay it for he hath
no pleasure in fools pay that which thou hast vowed
better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest
vow and not pay
suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou
before the angel that it was an error wherefore should god be angry
at thy voice and destroy the work of thine hands   for in the
multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities but
fear thou god
if thou seest the oppression of the poor and violent perverting
of judgment and justice in a province marvel not at the matter for
he that is higher than the highest regardeth and there be higher than
they
moreover the profit of the earth is for all the king himself is
served by the field
he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he
that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity
when goods increase they are increased that eat them and what
good is there to the owners thereof saving the beholding of them with
their eyes   the sleep of a labouring man is sweet whether he
eat little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him
to sleep
there is a sore evil which i have seen under the sun namely
riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt
but those riches perish by evil travail and he begetteth a son
and there is nothing in his hand
as he came forth of his mothers womb naked shall he return to
go as he came and shall take nothing of his labour which he may
carry away in his hand
and this also is a sore evil that in all points as he came so
shall he go and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind
all his days also he eateth in darkness and he hath much sorrow
and wrath with his sickness
behold that which i have seen it is good and comely for one to
eat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he
taketh under the sun all the days of his life which god giveth him
for it is his portion
every man also to whom god hath given riches and wealth and hath
given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to
rejoice in his labour this is the gift of god
for he shall not much remember the days of his life because god
answereth him in the joy of his heart
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun and it is common
among men  a man to whom god hath given riches wealth and
honour so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he
desireth yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof but a stranger
eateth it this is vanity and it is an evil disease
if a man beget an hundred children and live many years so that
the days of his years be many and his soul be not filled with good
and also that he have no burial i say that an untimely birth is
better than he
for he cometh in with vanity and departeth in darkness and his
name shall be covered with darkness
moreover he hath not seen the sun nor known any thing this hath
more rest than the other
yea though he live a thousand years twice told yet hath he seen
no good do not all go to one place   all the labour of man is for
his mouth and yet the appetite is not filled
for what hath the wise more than the fool what hath the poor
that knoweth to walk before the living   better is the sight of
the eyes than the wandering of the desire this is also vanity and
vexation of spirit
that which hath been is named already and it is known that it is
man neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he
seeing there be many things that increase vanity what is man the
better   for who knoweth what is good for man in this life all
the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow for who can
tell a man what shall be after him under the sun   a good name is
better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of
ones birth
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the
house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will
lay it to his heart
sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the
countenance the heart is made better
the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart
of fools is in the house of mirth
it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to
hear the song of fools
for as the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of
the fool this also is vanity
surely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth the
heart
better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the
patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit
be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the
bosom of fools
say not thou what is the cause that the former days were better
than these for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this
wisdom is good with an inheritance and by it there is profit to
them that see the sun
for wisdom is a defence and money is a defence but the
excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have
it
consider the work of god for who can make that straight which
he hath made crooked   in the day of prosperity be joyful but in
the day of adversity consider god also hath set the one over against
the other to the end that man should find nothing after him
all things have i seen in the days of my vanity there is a just
man that perisheth in his righteousness and there is a wicked man
that prolongeth his life in his wickedness
be not righteous over much neither make thyself over wise why
shouldest thou destroy thyself    be not over much wicked
neither be thou foolish why shouldest thou die before thy time
it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this yea also from this
withdraw not thine hand for he that feareth god shall come forth of
them all
wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are
in the city
for there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and
sinneth not
also take no heed unto all words that are spoken lest thou hear
thy servant curse thee  for oftentimes also thine own heart
knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others
all this have i proved by wisdom i said i will be wise but it
was far from me
that which is far off and exceeding deep who can find it out
i applied mine heart to know and to search and to seek out
wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly
even of foolishness and madness  and i find more bitter than
death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as
bands whoso pleaseth god shall escape from her but the sinner shall
be taken by her
behold this have i found saith the preacher counting one by
one to find out the account  which yet my soul seeketh but i
find not one man among a thousand have i found but a woman among all
those have i not found
lo this only have i found that god hath made man upright but
they have sought out many inventions
who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a
thing  a mans wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of
his face shall be changed
i counsel thee to keep the kings commandment and that in regard
of the oath of god
be not hasty to go out of his sight stand not in an evil thing
for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him
where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto
him what doest thou   whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no
evil thing and a wise mans heart discerneth both time and judgment
because to every purpose there is time and judgment therefore the
misery of man is great upon him
for he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him when
it shall be   there is no man that hath power over the spirit to
retain the spirit neither hath he power in the day of death and
there is no discharge in that war neither shall wickedness deliver
those that are given to it
all this have i seen and applied my heart unto every work that is
done under the sun there is a time wherein one man ruleth over
another to his own hurt
and so i saw the wicked buried who had come and gone from the
place of the holy and they were forgotten in the city where they had
so done this is also vanity
because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do
evil
though a sinner do evil an hundred times and his days be
prolonged yet surely i know that it shall be well with them that fear
god which fear before him  but it shall not be well with the
wicked neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow
because he feareth not before god
there is a vanity which is done upon the earth that there be
just men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked
again there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work
of the righteous i said that this also is vanity
then i commended mirth because a man hath no better thing under
the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry for that shall
abide with him of his labour the days of his life which god giveth
him under the sun
when i applied mine heart to know wisdom and to see the business
that is done upon the earth for also there is that neither day nor
night seeth sleep with his eyes  then i beheld all the work of
god that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun
because though a man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find it
yea farther though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be
able to find it
for all this i considered in my heart even to declare all this
that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of
god no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them
all things come alike to all there is one event to the righteous
and to the wicked to the good and to the clean and to the unclean
to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not as is the
good so is the sinner and he that sweareth as he that feareth an
oath
this is an evil among all things that are done under the sun that
there is one event unto all yea also the heart of the sons of men is
full of evil and madness is in their heart while they live and after
that they go to the dead
for to him that is joined to all the living there is hope for a
living dog is better than a dead lion
for the living know that they shall die but the dead know not any
thing neither have they any more a reward for the memory of them is
forgotten
also their love and their hatred and their envy is now
perished neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing
that is done under the sun
go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a
merry heart for god now accepteth thy works
let thy garments be always white and let thy head lack no
ointment
live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the
life of thy vanity which he hath given thee under the sun all the
days of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and in thy
labour which thou takest under the sun
whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for
there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave
whither thou goest
i returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the
swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise
nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favour to men of
skill but time and chance happeneth to them all
for man also knoweth not his time as the fishes that are taken
in an evil net and as the birds that are caught in the snare so are
the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falleth suddenly upon
them
this wisdom have i seen also under the sun and it seemed great
unto me  there was a little city and few men within it and
there came a great king against it and besieged it and built great
bulwarks against it  now there was found in it a poor wise man
and he by his wisdom delivered the city yet no man remembered that
same poor man
then said i wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the
poor mans wisdom is despised and his words are not heard
the words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him
that ruleth among fools
wisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroyeth
much good
dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a
stinking savour so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for
wisdom and honour
a wise mans heart is at his right hand but a fools heart at
his left
yea also when he that is a fool walketh by the way his wisdom
faileth him and he saith to every one that he is a fool
if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leave not thy
place for yielding pacifieth great offences
there is an evil which i have seen under the sun as an error
which proceedeth from the ruler  folly is set in great dignity
and the rich sit in low place
i have seen servants upon horses and princes walking as servants
upon the earth
he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and whoso breaketh an
hedge a serpent shall bite him
whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith and he that
cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby
if the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edge then must he
put to more strength but wisdom is profitable to direct
surely the serpent will bite without enchantment and a babbler
is no better
the words of a wise mans mouth are gracious but the lips of a
fool will swallow up himself
the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness and the
end of his talk is mischievous madness
a fool also is full of words a man cannot tell what shall be
and what shall be after him who can tell him   the labour of
the foolish wearieth every one of them because he knoweth not how to
go to the city
woe to thee o land when thy king is a child and thy princes
eat in the morning   blessed art thou o land when thy king is
the son of nobles and thy princes eat in due season for strength
and not for drunkenness   by much slothfulness the building
decayeth and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth
through
a feast is made for laughter and wine maketh merry but money
answereth all things
curse not the king no not in thy thought and curse not the
rich in thy bedchamber for a bird of the air shall carry the voice
and that which hath wings shall tell the matter
cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many
days
give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not
what evil shall be upon the earth
if the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon the
earth and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north in
the place where the tree falleth there it shall be
he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth
the clouds shall not reap
as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how the
bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou
knowest not the works of god who maketh all
in the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold not
thine hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or
that or whether they both shall be alike good
truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes
to behold the sun  but if a man live many years and rejoice in
them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be
many all that cometh is vanity
rejoice o young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee
in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in
the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things god
will bring thee into judgment
therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from
thy flesh for childhood and youth are vanity
remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil
days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no
pleasure in them  while the sun or the light or the moon or
the stars be not darkened nor the clouds return after the rain
in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong
men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few
and those that look out of the windows be darkened  and the doors
shall be shut in the streets when the sound of the grinding is low
and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughters
of musick shall be brought low  also when they shall be afraid of
that which is high and fears shall be in the way and the almond tree
shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire
shall fail because man goeth to his long home and the mourners go
about the streets  or ever the silver cord be loosed or the
golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or
the wheel broken at the cistern
then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit
shall return unto god who gave it
vanity of vanities saith the preacher all is vanity
and moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the
people knowledge yea he gave good heed and sought out and set in
order many proverbs
the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which
was written was upright even words of truth
the words of the wise are as goads and as nails fastened by the
masters of assemblies which are given from one shepherd
and further by these my son be admonished of making many
books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh
let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and
keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man
for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret
thing whether it be good or whether it be evil
the song of solomon
the song of songs which is solomons
let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is
better than wine
because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as
ointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee
draw me we will run after thee the king hath brought me into his
chambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee we will remember thy
love more than wine the upright love thee
i am black but comely o ye daughters of jerusalem as the tents
of kedar as the curtains of solomon
look not upon me because i am black because the sun hath looked
upon me my mothers children were angry with me they made me the
keeper of the vineyards but mine own vineyard have i not kept
tell me o thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest where
thou makest thy flock to rest at noon for why should i be as one that
turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions   if thou know not
o thou fairest among women go thy way forth by the footsteps of the
flock and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents
i have compared thee o my love to a company of horses in
pharaohs chariots
thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels thy neck with chains
of gold
we will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver
while the king sitteth at his table my spikenard sendeth forth
the smell thereof
a bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me he shall lie all
night betwixt my breasts
my beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards
of engedi
behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast
doves eyes
behold thou art fair my beloved yea pleasant also our bed is
green
the beams of our house are cedar and our rafters of fir
i am the rose of sharon and the lily of the valleys
as the lily among thorns so is my love among the daughters
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved
among the sons i sat down under his shadow with great delight and
his fruit was sweet to my taste
he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was
love
stay me with flagons comfort me with apples for i am sick of
love
his left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace
me
i charge you o ye daughters of jerusalem by the roes and by the
hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he
please
the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the
mountains skipping upon the hills
my beloved is like a roe or a young hart behold he standeth
behind our wall he looketh forth at the windows shewing himself
through the lattice
my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair
one and come away
for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone  the
flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come
and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land  the fig tree
putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give
a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away
o my dove that art in the clefts of the rock in the secret
places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy
voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely
take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for
our vines have tender grapes
my beloved is mine and i am his he feedeth among the lilies
until the day break and the shadows flee away turn my beloved
and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of bether
by night on my bed i sought him whom my soul loveth i sought him
but i found him not
i will rise now and go about the city in the streets and in the
broad ways i will seek him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i
found him not
the watchmen that go about the city found me to whom i said saw
ye him whom my soul loveth   it was but a little that i passed
from them but i found him whom my soul loveth i held him and would
not let him go until i had brought him into my mothers house and
into the chamber of her that conceived me
i charge you o ye daughters of jerusalem by the roes and by the
hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he
please
who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of
smoke perfumed with myrrh and frankincense with all powders of the
merchant   behold his bed which is solomons threescore valiant
men are about it of the valiant of israel
they all hold swords being expert in war every man hath his
sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night
king solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of lebanon
he made the pillars thereof of silver the bottom thereof of
gold the covering of it of purple the midst thereof being paved with
love for the daughters of jerusalem
go forth o ye daughters of zion and behold king solomon with
the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his
espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart
behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast
doves eyes within thy locks thy hair is as a flock of goats that
appear from mount gilead
thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which
came up from the washing whereof every one bear twins and none is
barren among them
thy lips are like a thread of scarlet and thy speech is comely
thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks
thy neck is like the tower of david builded for an armoury
whereon there hang a thousand bucklers all shields of mighty men
thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins which feed
among the lilies
until the day break and the shadows flee away i will get me to
the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense
thou art all fair my love there is no spot in thee
come with me from lebanon my spouse with me from lebanon look
from the top of amana from the top of shenir and hermon from the
lions dens from the mountains of the leopards
thou hast ravished my heart my sister my spouse thou hast
ravished my heart with one of thine eyes with one chain of thy neck
how fair is thy love my sister my spouse how much better is
thy love than wine and the smell of thine ointments than all spices
thy lips o my spouse drop as the honeycomb honey and milk are
under thy tongue and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of
lebanon
a garden inclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a
fountain sealed
thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits
camphire with spikenard  spikenard and saffron calamus and
cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all
the chief spices  a fountain of gardens a well of living waters
and streams from lebanon
awake o north wind and come thou south blow upon my garden
that the spices thereof may flow out let my beloved come into his
garden and eat his pleasant fruits
i am come into my garden my sister my spouse i have gathered my
myrrh with my spice i have eaten my honeycomb with my honey i have
drunk my wine with my milk eat o friends drink yea drink
abundantly o beloved
i sleep but my heart waketh it is the voice of my beloved that
knocketh saying open to me my sister my love my dove my
undefiled for my head is filled with dew and my locks with the drops
of the night
i have put off my coat how shall i put it on i have washed my
feet how shall i defile them   my beloved put in his hand by the
hole of the door and my bowels were moved for him
i rose up to open to my beloved and my hands dropped with myrrh
and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh upon the handles of the
lock
i opened to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself and
was gone my soul failed when he spake i sought him but i could not
find him i called him but he gave me no answer
the watchmen that went about the city found me they smote me
they wounded me the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me
i charge you o daughters of jerusalem if ye find my beloved
that ye tell him that i am sick of love
what is thy beloved more than another beloved o thou fairest
among women what is thy beloved more than another beloved that thou
dost so charge us   my beloved is white and ruddy the chiefest
among ten thousand
his head is as the most fine gold his locks are bushy and black
as a raven
his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters washed
with milk and fitly set
his cheeks are as a bed of spices as sweet flowers his lips
like lilies dropping sweet smelling myrrh
his hands are as gold rings set with the beryl his belly is as
bright ivory overlaid with sapphires
his legs are as pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold
his countenance is as lebanon excellent as the cedars
his mouth is most sweet yea he is altogether lovely this is my
beloved and this is my friend o daughters of jerusalem
whither is thy beloved gone o thou fairest among women whither
is thy beloved turned aside that we may seek him with thee
my beloved is gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to
feed in the gardens and to gather lilies
i am my beloveds and my beloved is mine he feedeth among the
lilies
thou art beautiful o my love as tirzah comely as jerusalem
terrible as an army with banners
turn away thine eyes from me for they have overcome me thy hair
is as a flock of goats that appear from gilead
thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing
whereof every one beareth twins and there is not one barren among
them
as a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks
there are threescore queens and fourscore concubines and virgins
without number
my dove my undefiled is but one she is the only one of her
mother she is the choice one of her that bare her the daughters saw
her and blessed her yea the queens and the concubines and they
praised her
who is she that looketh forth as the morning fair as the moon
clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners   i went
down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley and to
see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded
or ever i was aware my soul made me like the chariots of
amminadib
return return o shulamite return return that we may look
upon thee what will ye see in the shulamite as it were the company
of two armies
how beautiful are thy feet with shoes o princes daughter the
joints of thy thighs are like jewels the work of the hands of a
cunning workman
thy navel is like a round goblet which wanteth not liquor thy
belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies
thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins
thy neck is as a tower of ivory thine eyes like the fishpools in
heshbon by the gate of bathrabbim thy nose is as the tower of
lebanon which looketh toward damascus
thine head upon thee is like carmel and the hair of thine head
like purple the king is held in the galleries
how fair and how pleasant art thou o love for delights
this thy stature is like to a palm tree and thy breasts to clusters
of grapes
i said i will go up to the palm tree i will take hold of the
boughs thereof now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine
and the smell of thy nose like apples  and the roof of thy mouth
like the best wine for my beloved that goeth down sweetly causing
the lips of those that are asleep to speak
i am my beloveds and his desire is toward me
come my beloved let us go forth into the field let us lodge in
the villages
let us get up early to the vineyards let us see if the vine
flourish whether the tender grape appear and the pomegranates bud
forth there will i give thee my loves
the mandrakes give a smell and at our gates are all manner of
pleasant fruits new and old which i have laid up for thee o my
beloved
o that thou wert as my brother that sucked the breasts of my
mother  when i should find thee without i would kiss thee yea i
should not be despised
i would lead thee and bring thee into my mothers house who
would instruct me i would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the
juice of my pomegranate
his left hand should be under my head and his right hand should
embrace me
i charge you o daughters of jerusalem that ye stir not up nor
awake my love until he please
who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her
beloved i raised thee up under the apple tree there thy mother
brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bare thee
set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for
love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals
thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehement flame
many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it
if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would
utterly be contemned
we have a little sister and she hath no breasts what shall we do
for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for   if she be
a wall we will build upon her a palace of silver and if she be a
door we will inclose her with boards of cedar
i am a wall and my breasts like towers then was i in his eyes
as one that found favour
solomon had a vineyard at baalhamon he let out the vineyard unto
keepers every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand
pieces of silver
my vineyard which is mine is before me thou o solomon must
have a thousand and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred
thou that dwellest in the gardens the companions hearken to thy
voice cause me to hear it
make haste my beloved and be thou like to a roe or to a young
hart upon the mountains of spices
the book of the prophet isaiah
the vision of isaiah the son of amoz which he saw concerning
judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah
kings of judah
hear o heavens and give ear o earth for the lord hath spoken
i have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled
against me
the ox knoweth his owner and the ass his masters crib but
israel doth not know my people doth not consider
ah sinful nation a people laden with iniquity a seed of
evildoers children that are corrupters they have forsaken the lord
they have provoked the holy one of israel unto anger they are gone
away backward
why should ye be stricken any more ye will revolt more and more
the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint
from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness
in it but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores they have not
been closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment
your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your
land strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate as
overthrown by strangers
and the daughter of zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard as a
lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city
except the lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we
should have been as sodom and we should have been like unto gomorrah
hear the word of the lord ye rulers of sodom give ear unto the
law of our god ye people of gomorrah
to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me
saith the lord i am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat
of fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of
lambs or of he goats
when ye come to appear before me who hath required this at your
hand to tread my courts   bring no more vain oblations incense
is an abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the calling of
assemblies i cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn
meeting
your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are
a trouble unto me i am weary to bear them
and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from
you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear your hands are
full of blood
wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from
before mine eyes cease to do evil  learn to do well seek
judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the
widow
come now and let us reason together saith the lord though your
sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red
like crimson they shall be as wool
if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land
but if ye refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword
for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
how is the faithful city become an harlot it was full of
judgment righteousness lodged in it but now murderers
thy silver is become dross thy wine mixed with water  thy
princes are rebellious and companions of thieves every one loveth
gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherless
neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them
therefore saith the lord the lord of hosts the mighty one of
israel ah i will ease me of mine adversaries and avenge me of mine
enemies  and i will turn my hand upon thee and purely purge away
thy dross and take away all thy tin  and i will restore thy
judges as at the first and thy counsellors as at the beginning
afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness the
faithful city
zion shall be redeemed with judgment and her converts with
righteousness
and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall
be together and they that forsake the lord shall be consumed
for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired and
ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen
for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth and as a garden that
hath no water
and the strong shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark
and they shall both burn together and none shall quench them
the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concerning judah and
jerusalem
and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of
the lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains and
shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto it
and many people shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the
mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he will
teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of zion
shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem
and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many
people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their
spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against
nation neither shall they learn war any more
o house of jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of the
lord
therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of jacob
because they be replenished from the east and are soothsayers like
the philistines and they please themselves in the children of
strangers
their land also is full of silver and gold neither is there any
end of their treasures their land is also full of horses neither is
there any end of their chariots  their land also is full of idols
they worship the work of their own hands that which their own fingers
have made  and the mean man boweth down and the great man
humbleth himself therefore forgive them not
enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the
lord and for the glory of his majesty
the lofty looks of man shall be humbled and the haughtiness of
men shall be bowed down and the lord alone shall be exalted in that
day
for the day of the lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is
proud and lofty and upon every one that is lifted up and he shall be
brought low  and upon all the cedars of lebanon that are high
and lifted up and upon all the oaks of bashan  and upon all the
high mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up  and
upon every high tower and upon every fenced wall  and upon all
the ships of tarshish and upon all pleasant pictures
and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down and the haughtiness
of men shall be made low and the lord alone shall be exalted in that
day
and the idols he shall utterly abolish
and they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves
of the earth for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty
when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth
in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols
of gold which they made each one for himself to worship to the moles
and to the bats  to go into the clefts of the rocks and into the
tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the lord and for the glory of
his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth
cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils for wherein
is he to be accounted of    for behold the lord the lord of
hosts doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the
staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water
the mighty man and the man of war the judge and the prophet
and the prudent and the ancient  the captain of fifty and the
honourable man and the counsellor and the cunning artificer and the
eloquent orator
and i will give children to be their princes and babes shall rule
over them
and the people shall be oppressed every one by another and every
one by his neighbour the child shall behave himself proudly against
the ancient and the base against the honourable
when a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his
father saying thou hast clothing be thou our ruler and let this
ruin be under thy hand  in that day shall he swear saying i will
not be an healer for in my house is neither bread nor clothing make
me not a ruler of the people
for jerusalem is ruined and judah is fallen because their tongue
and their doings are against the lord to provoke the eyes of his
glory
the shew of their countenance doth witness against them and they
declare their sin as sodom they hide it not woe unto their soul for
they have rewarded evil unto themselves
say ye to the righteous that it shall be well with him for they
shall eat the fruit of their doings
woe unto the wicked it shall be ill with him for the reward of
his hands shall be given him
as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule
over them o my people they which lead thee cause thee to err and
destroy the way of thy paths
the lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the people
the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his
people and the princes thereof for ye have eaten up the vineyard
the spoil of the poor is in your houses
what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces and grind the
faces of the poor saith the lord god of hosts
moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion are
haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walking
and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet
therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the
daughters of zion and the lord will discover their secret parts
in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling
ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires
like the moon  the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers
the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands
and the tablets and the earrings  the rings and nose jewels
the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the
wimples and the crisping pins  the glasses and the fine linen
and the hoods and the vails
and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there
shall be stink and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of well
set hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth
and burning instead of beauty
thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war
and her gates shall lament and mourn and she being desolate
shall sit upon the ground
and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we
will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be
called by thy name to take away our reproach
in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and
glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for
them that are escaped of israel
and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he
that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that
is written among the living in jerusalem  when the lord shall have
washed away the filth of the daughters of zion and shall have purged
the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of
judgment and by the spirit of burning
and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion
and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of
a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defence
and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from
the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and
from rain
now will i sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching
his vineyard my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill
and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted
it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and
also made a winepress therein and he looked that it should bring
forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes
and now o inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah judge i
pray you betwixt me and my vineyard
what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have not
done in it wherefore when i looked that it should bring forth
grapes brought it forth wild grapes   and now go to i will tell
you what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereof
and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it
shall be trodden down  and i will lay it waste it shall not be
pruned nor digged but there shall come up briers and thorns i will
also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it
for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and
the men of judah his pleasant plant and he looked for judgment but
behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry
woe unto them that join house to house that lay field to field
till there be no place that they may be placed alone in the midst of
the earth   in mine ears said the lord of hosts of a truth many
houses shall be desolate even great and fair without inhabitant
yea ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of
an homer shall yield an ephah
woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may
follow strong drink that continue until night till wine inflame
them   and the harp and the viol the tabret and pipe and
wine are in their feasts but they regard not the work of the lord
neither consider the operation of his hands
therefore my people are gone into captivity because they have no
knowledge and their honourable men are famished and their multitude
dried up with thirst
therefore hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouth
without measure and their glory and their multitude and their pomp
and he that rejoiceth shall descend into it
and the mean man shall be brought down and the mighty man shall
be humbled and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled  but the
lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment and god that is holy shall
be sanctified in righteousness
then shall the lambs feed after their manner and the waste
places of the fat ones shall strangers eat
woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as
it were with a cart rope  that say let him make speed and
hasten his work that we may see it and let the counsel of the holy
one of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it   woe unto
them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light
and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for
bitter   woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and
prudent in their own sight   woe unto them that are mighty to
drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink  which
justify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the
righteous from him   therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble
and the flame consumeth the chaff so their root shall be as
rottenness and their blossom shall go up as dust because they have
cast away the law of the lord of hosts and despised the word of the
holy one of israel
therefore is the anger of the lord kindled against his people
and he hath stretched forth his hand against them and hath smitten
them and the hills did tremble and their carcases were torn in the
midst of the streets
for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched
out still
and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far and will
hiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come
with speed swiftly  none shall be weary nor stumble among them
none shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loins
be loosed nor the latchet of their shoes be broken  whose arrows
are sharp and all their bows bent their horses hoofs shall be
counted like flint and their wheels like a whirlwind  their
roaring shall be like a lion they shall roar like young lions yea
they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carry it away
safe and none shall deliver it
and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of
the sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness and sorrow
and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof
in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon
a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple
above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain
he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with
twain he did fly
and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the
lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory
and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried
and the house was filled with smoke
then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of
unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips
for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts
then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his
hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar  and he
laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and
thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged
also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and
who will go for us then said i here am i send me
and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but
understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not
make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and
shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their
ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed
then said i lord how long and he answered until the cities be
wasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land be
utterly desolate  and the lord have removed men far away and
there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land
but yet in it shall be a tenth and it shall return and shall be
eaten as a teil tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when
they cast their leaves so the holy seed shall be the substance
thereof
and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the son
of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of syria and pekah the
son of remaliah king of israel went up toward jerusalem to war
against it but could not prevail against it
and it was told the house of david saying syria is confederate
with ephraim and his heart was moved and the heart of his people as
the trees of the wood are moved with the wind
then said the lord unto isaiah go forth now to meet ahaz thou
and shearjashub thy son at the end of the conduit of the upper pool
in the highway of the fullers field  and say unto him take heed
and be quiet fear not neither be fainthearted for the two tails of
these smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of rezin with syria
and of the son of remaliah
because syria ephraim and the son of remaliah have taken evil
counsel against thee saying  let us go up against judah and vex
it and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the
midst of it even the son of tabeal  thus saith the lord god it
shall not stand neither shall it come to pass
for the head of syria is damascus and the head of damascus is
rezin and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken
that it be not a people
and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is
remaliahs son if ye will not believe surely ye shall not be
established
moreover the lord spake again unto ahaz saying  ask thee a
sign of the lord thy god ask it either in the depth or in the height
above
but ahaz said i will not ask neither will i tempt the lord
and he said hear ye now o house of david is it a small thing
for you to weary men but will ye weary my god also   therefore
the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall
conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel
butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the
evil and choose the good
for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose
the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her
kings
the lord shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thy
fathers house days that have not come from the day that ephraim
departed from judah even the king of assyria
and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall hiss
for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of egypt and
for the bee that is in the land of assyria
and they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate
valleys and in the holes of the rocks and upon all thorns and upon
all bushes
in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that is hired
namely by them beyond the river by the king of assyria the head
and the hair of the feet and it shall also consume the beard
and it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish a
young cow and two sheep  and it shall come to pass for the
abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter for butter
and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land
and it shall come to pass in that day that every place shall be
where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings it shall
even be for briers and thorns
with arrows and with bows shall men come thither because all the
land shall become briers and thorns
and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock there
shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns but it shall be
for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of lesser cattle
moreover the lord said unto me take thee a great roll and write
in it with a mans pen concerning mahershalalhashbaz
and i took unto me faithful witnesses to record uriah the priest
and zechariah the son of jeberechiah
and i went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bare a son
then said the lord to me call his name mahershalalhashbaz
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry my father and
my mother the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be
taken away before the king of assyria
the lord spake also unto me again saying  forasmuch as this
people refuseth the waters of shiloah that go softly and rejoice in
rezin and remaliahs son  now therefore behold the lord bringeth
up upon them the waters of the river strong and many even the king
of assyria and all his glory and he shall come up over all his
channels and go over all his banks  and he shall pass through
judah he shall overflow and go over he shall reach even to the neck
and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy
land o immanuel
associate yourselves o ye people and ye shall be broken in
pieces and give ear all ye of far countries gird yourselves and ye
shall be broken in pieces gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in
pieces
take counsel together and it shall come to nought speak the
word and it shall not stand for god is with us
for the lord spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructed
me that i should not walk in the way of this people saying  say
ye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people shall say a
confederacy neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid
sanctify the lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear and
let him be your dread
and he shall be for a sanctuary but for a stone of stumbling and
for a rock of offence to both the houses of israel for a gin and for
a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem
and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and
be snared and be taken
bind up the testimony seal the law among my disciples
and i will wait upon the lord that hideth his face from the
house of jacob and i will look for him
behold i and the children whom the lord hath given me are for
signs and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts which dwelleth
in mount zion
and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have
familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter should
not a people seek unto their god for the living to the dead   to
the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this
word it is because there is no light in them
and they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry and it
shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry they shall fret
themselves and curse their king and their god and look upward
and they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble and
darkness dimness of anguish and they shall be driven to darkness
nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation
when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and the
land of naphtali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the
way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations
the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they
that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the
light shined
thou hast multiplied the nation and not increased the joy they
joy before thee according to the joy in harvest and as men rejoice
when they divide the spoil
for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his
shoulder the rod of his oppressor as in the day of midian
for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and
garments rolled in blood but this shall be with burning and fuel of
fire
for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the
government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called
wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the
prince of peace
of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end
upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to
establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for
ever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this
the lord sent a word into jacob and it hath lighted upon israel
and all the people shall know even ephraim and the inhabitant of
samaria that say in the pride and stoutness of heart  the bricks
are fallen down but we will build with hewn stones the sycomores are
cut down but we will change them into cedars
therefore the lord shall set up the adversaries of rezin against
him and join his enemies together  the syrians before and the
philistines behind and they shall devour israel with open mouth for
all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out
still
for the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them neither do
they seek the lord of hosts
therefore the lord will cut off from israel head and tail branch
and rush in one day
the ancient and honourable he is the head and the prophet that
teacheth lies he is the tail
for the leaders of this people cause them to err and they that
are led of them are destroyed
therefore the lord shall have no joy in their young men neither
shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows for every one is an
hypocrite and an evildoer and every mouth speaketh folly for all
this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out
still
for wickedness burneth as the fire it shall devour the briers
and thorns and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest and they
shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke
through the wrath of the lord of hosts is the land darkened and
the people shall be as the fuel of the fire no man shall spare his
brother
and he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry and he
shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied they
shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm  manasseh ephraim
and ephraim manasseh and they together shall be against judah for
all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out
still
woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees and that write
grievousness which they have prescribed  to turn aside the needy
from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of my people
that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless
and what will ye do in the day of visitation and in the
desolation which shall come from far to whom will ye flee for help
and where will ye leave your glory   without me they shall bow
down under the prisoners and they shall fall under the slain for all
this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out
still
o assyrian the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is
mine indignation
i will send him against an hypocritical nation and against the
people of my wrath will i give him a charge to take the spoil and to
take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets
howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so but
it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few
for he saith are not my princes altogether kings   is not
calno as carchemish is not hamath as arpad is not samaria as
damascus   as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols and
whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria
shall i not as i have done unto samaria and her idols so do to
jerusalem and her idols   wherefore it shall come to pass that
when the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and on
jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of
assyria and the glory of his high looks
for he saith by the strength of my hand i have done it and by
my wisdom for i am prudent and i have removed the bounds of the
people and have robbed their treasures and i have put down the
inhabitants like a valiant man  and my hand hath found as a nest
the riches of the people and as one gathereth eggs that are left
have i gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wing
or opened the mouth or peeped
shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith or
shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it as if the
rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if the
staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood
therefore shall the lord the lord of hosts send among his fat
ones leanness and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the
burning of a fire
and the light of israel shall be for a fire and his holy one
for a flame and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in
one day  and shall consume the glory of his forest and of his
fruitful field both soul and body and they shall be as when a
standardbearer fainteth
and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few that a
child may write them
and it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of
israel and such as are escaped of the house of jacob shall no more
again stay upon him that smote them but shall stay upon the lord the
holy one of israel in truth
the remnant shall return even the remnant of jacob unto the
mighty god
for though thy people israel be as the sand of the sea yet a
remnant of them shall return the consumption decreed shall overflow
with righteousness
for the lord god of hosts shall make a consumption even
determined in the midst of all the land
therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts o my people that
dwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee
with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner
of egypt
for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease
and mine anger in their destruction
and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according
to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb and as his rod was
upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt
and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be
taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and
the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing
he is come to aiath he is passed to migron at michmash he hath
laid up his carriages  they are gone over the passage they have
taken up their lodging at geba ramah is afraid gibeah of saul is
fled
lift up thy voice o daughter of gallim cause it to be heard
unto laish o poor anathoth
madmenah is removed the inhabitants of gebim gather themselves
to flee
as yet shall he remain at nob that day he shall shake his hand
against the mount of the daughter of zion the hill of jerusalem
behold the lord the lord of hosts shall lop the bough with
terror and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down and the
haughty shall be humbled
and he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron and
lebanon shall fall by a mighty one
and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a
branch shall grow out of his roots  and the spirit of the lord
shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the
spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear
of the lord  and shall make him of quick understanding in the
fear of the lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes
neither reprove after the hearing of his ears  but with
righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the
meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his
mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked
and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and
faithfulness the girdle of his reins
the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall
lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling
together and a little child shall lead them
and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie
down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox
and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the
weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the
earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover
the sea
and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall
stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and
his rest shall be glorious
and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall set
his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people
which shall be left from assyria and from egypt and from pathros
and from cush and from elam and from shinar and from hamath and
from the islands of the sea
and he shall set up an ensign for the nations and shall
assemble the outcasts of israel and gather together the dispersed of
judah from the four corners of the earth
the envy also of ephraim shall depart and the adversaries of
judah shall be cut off ephraim shall not envy judah and judah shall
not vex ephraim
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines toward
the west they shall spoil them of the east together they shall lay
their hand upon edom and moab and the children of ammon shall obey
them
and the lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the egyptian
sea and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river
and shall smite it in the seven streams and make men go over dryshod
and there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people
which shall be left from assyria like as it was to israel in the day
that he came up out of the land of egypt
and in that day thou shalt say o lord i will praise thee
though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away and thou
comfortedst me
behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for
the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my
salvation
therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
salvation
and in that day shall ye say praise the lord call upon his
name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name
is exalted
sing unto the lord for he hath done excellent things this is
known in all the earth
cry out and shout thou inhabitant of zion for great is the holy
one of israel in the midst of thee
the burden of babylon which isaiah the son of amoz did see
lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain exalt the voice unto
them shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the nobles
i have commanded my sanctified ones i have also called my mighty
ones for mine anger even them that rejoice in my highness
the noise of a multitude in the mountains like as of a great
people a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered
together the lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle
they come from a far country from the end of heaven even the
lord and the weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole land
howl ye for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a
destruction from the almighty
therefore shall all hands be faint and every mans heart shall
melt  and they shall be afraid pangs and sorrows shall take hold
of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall
be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames
behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with wrath and
fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the
sinners thereof out of it
for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not
give their light the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and
the moon shall not cause her light to shine
and i will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for
their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease
and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible
i will make a man more precious than fine gold even a man than
the golden wedge of ophir
therefore i will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove
out of her place in the wrath of the lord of hosts and in the day of
his fierce anger
and it shall be as the chased roe and as a sheep that no man
taketh up they shall every man turn to his own people and flee every
one into his own land
every one that is found shall be thrust through and every one
that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword
their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes
their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished
behold i will stir up the medes against them which shall not
regard silver and as for gold they shall not delight in it
their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces and they
shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb their eyes shall not
spare children
and babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the chaldees
excellency shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah
it shall never be inhabited neither shall it be dwelt in from
generation to generation neither shall the arabian pitch tent there
neither shall the shepherds make their fold there
but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there and their houses
shall be full of doleful creatures and owls shall dwell there and
satyrs shall dance there
and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate
houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces and her time is near to
come and her days shall not be prolonged
for the lord will have mercy on jacob and will yet choose
israel and set them in their own land and the strangers shall be
joined with them and they shall cleave to the house of jacob
and the people shall take them and bring them to their place
and the house of israel shall possess them in the land of the lord for
servants and handmaids and they shall take them captives whose
captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressors
and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give
thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard
bondage wherein thou wast made to serve  that thou shalt take up
this proverb against the king of babylon and say how hath the
oppressor ceased the golden city ceased   the lord hath broken
the staff of the wicked and the sceptre of the rulers
he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke he that
ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hindereth
the whole earth is at rest and is quiet they break forth into
singing
yea the fir trees rejoice at thee and the cedars of lebanon
saying since thou art laid down no feller is come up against us
hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming
it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the
earth it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the
nations
all they shall speak and say unto thee art thou also become
weak as we art thou become like unto us   thy pomp is brought
down to the grave and the noise of thy viols the worm is spread
under thee and the worms cover thee
how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning
how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations
for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i
will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the
mount of the congregation in the sides of the north  i will
ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high
yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit
they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider
thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did
shake kingdoms  that made the world as a wilderness and
destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his
prisoners   all the kings of the nations even all of them lie
in glory every one in his own house
but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch
and as the raiment of those that are slain thrust through with a
sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a carcase trodden
under feet
thou shalt not be joined with them in burial because thou hast
destroyed thy land and slain thy people the seed of evildoers shall
never be renowned
prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their
fathers that they do not rise nor possess the land nor fill the
face of the world with cities
for i will rise up against them saith the lord of hosts and
cut off from babylon the name and remnant and son and nephew saith
the lord
i will also make it a possession for the bittern and pools of
water and i will sweep it with the besom of destruction saith the
lord of hosts
the lord of hosts hath sworn saying surely as i have thought
so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall it stand
that i will break the assyrian in my land and upon my mountains
tread him under foot then shall his yoke depart from off them and
his burden depart from off their shoulders
this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and
this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations
for the lord of hosts hath purposed and who shall disannul it
and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back   in
the year that king ahaz died was this burden
rejoice not thou whole palestina because the rod of him that
smote thee is broken for out of the serpents root shall come forth a
cockatrice and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent
and the firstborn of the poor shall feed and the needy shall
lie down in safety and i will kill thy root with famine and he shall
slay thy remnant
howl o gate cry o city thou whole palestina art dissolved
for there shall come from the north a smoke and none shall be alone
in his appointed times
what shall one then answer the messengers of the nation that
the lord hath founded zion and the poor of his people shall trust in
it
the burden of moab because in the night ar of moab is laid
waste and brought to silence because in the night kir of moab is
laid waste and brought to silence  he is gone up to bajith and
to dibon the high places to weep moab shall howl over nebo and
over medeba on all their heads shall be baldness and every beard cut
off
in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth on
the tops of their houses and in their streets every one shall howl
weeping abundantly
and heshbon shall cry and elealeh their voice shall be heard
even unto jahaz therefore the armed soldiers of moab shall cry out
his life shall be grievous unto him
my heart shall cry out for moab his fugitives shall flee unto
zoar an heifer of three years old for by the mounting up of luhith
with weeping shall they go it up for in the way of horonaim they
shall raise up a cry of destruction
for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate for the hay is
withered away the grass faileth there is no green thing
therefore the abundance they have gotten and that which they
have laid up shall they carry away to the brook of the willows
for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab the howling
thereof unto eglaim and the howling thereof unto beerelim
for the waters of dimon shall be full of blood for i will bring
more upon dimon lions upon him that escapeth of moab and upon the
remnant of the land
send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from sela to the
wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of zion
for it shall be that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest
so the daughters of moab shall be at the fords of arnon
take counsel execute judgment make thy shadow as the night in
the midst of the noonday hide the outcasts bewray not him that
wandereth
let mine outcasts dwell with thee moab be thou a covert to them
from the face of the spoiler for the extortioner is at an end the
spoiler ceaseth the oppressors are consumed out of the land
and in mercy shall the throne be established and he shall sit
upon it in truth in the tabernacle of david judging and seeking
judgment and hasting righteousness
we have heard of the pride of moab he is very proud even of his
haughtiness and his pride and his wrath but his lies shall not be
so
therefore shall moab howl for moab every one shall howl for the
foundations of kirhareseth shall ye mourn surely they are stricken
for the fields of heshbon languish and the vine of sibmah the
lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof
they are come even unto jazer they wandered through the wilderness
her branches are stretched out they are gone over the sea
therefore i will bewail with the weeping of jazer the vine of
sibmah i will water thee with my tears o heshbon and elealeh for
the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen
and gladness is taken away and joy out of the plentiful field
and in the vineyards there shall be no singing neither shall there be
shouting the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses i
have made their vintage shouting to cease
wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for moab and mine
inward parts for kirharesh
and it shall come to pass when it is seen that moab is weary on
the high place that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray but he
shall not prevail
this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning moab since
that time
but now the lord hath spoken saying within three years as the
years of an hireling and the glory of moab shall be contemned with
all that great multitude and the remnant shall be very small and
feeble
the burden of damascus behold damascus is taken away from being
a city and it shall be a ruinous heap
the cities of aroer are forsaken they shall be for flocks which
shall lie down and none shall make them afraid
the fortress also shall cease from ephraim and the kingdom from
damascus and the remnant of syria they shall be as the glory of the
children of israel saith the lord of hosts
and in that day it shall come to pass that the glory of jacob
shall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean
and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn and
reapeth the ears with his arm and it shall be as he that gathereth
ears in the valley of rephaim
yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it as the shaking of an
olive tree two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough
four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof saith the lord
god of israel
at that day shall a man look to his maker and his eyes shall
have respect to the holy one of israel
and he shall not look to the altars the work of his hands
neither shall respect that which his fingers have made either the
groves or the images
in that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough and
an uppermost branch which they left because of the children of
israel and there shall be desolation
because thou hast forgotten the god of thy salvation and hast
not been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore shalt thou
plant pleasant plants and shalt set it with strange slips  in
the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow and in the morning shalt
thou make thy seed to flourish but the harvest shall be a heap in the
day of grief and of desperate sorrow
woe to the multitude of many people which make a noise like the
noise of the seas and to the rushing of nations that make a rushing
like the rushing of mighty waters   the nations shall rush like
the rushing of many waters but god shall rebuke them and they shall
flee far off and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before
the wind and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind
and behold at eveningtide trouble and before the morning he is
not
this is the portion of them that spoil us and the lot of them that
rob us
woe to the land shadowing with wings which is beyond the rivers
of ethiopia  that sendeth ambassadors by the sea even in vessels
of bulrushes upon the waters saying go ye swift messengers to a
nation scattered and peeled to a people terrible from their beginning
hitherto a nation meted out and trodden down whose land the rivers
have spoiled   all ye inhabitants of the world and dwellers on
the earth see ye when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains and
when he bloweth a trumpet hear ye
for so the lord said unto me i will take my rest and i will
consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs and like a
cloud of dew in the heat of harvest
for afore the harvest when the bud is perfect and the sour
grape is ripening in the flower he shall both cut off the sprigs with
pruning hooks and take away and cut down the branches
they shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains and
to the beasts of the earth and the fowls shall summer upon them and
all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them
in that time shall the present be brought unto the lord of hosts
of a people scattered and peeled and from a people terrible from
their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden under foot
whose land the rivers have spoiled to the place of the name of the
lord of hosts the mount zion
the burden of egypt behold the lord rideth upon a swift cloud
and shall come into egypt and the idols of egypt shall be moved at
his presence and the heart of egypt shall melt in the midst of it
and i will set the egyptians against the egyptians and they
shall fight every one against his brother and every one against his
neighbour city against city and kingdom against kingdom
and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst thereof and i
will destroy the counsel thereof and they shall seek to the idols
and to the charmers and to them that have familiar spirits and to
the wizards
and the egyptians will i give over into the hand of a cruel lord
and a fierce king shall rule over them saith the lord the lord of
hosts
and the waters shall fail from the sea and the river shall be
wasted and dried up
and they shall turn the rivers far away and the brooks of
defence shall be emptied and dried up the reeds and flags shall
wither
the paper reeds by the brooks by the mouth of the brooks and
every thing sown by the brooks shall wither be driven away and be
no more
the fishers also shall mourn and all they that cast angle into
the brooks shall lament and they that spread nets upon the waters
shall languish
moreover they that work in fine flax and they that weave
networks shall be confounded
and they shall be broken in the purposes thereof all that make
sluices and ponds for fish
surely the princes of zoan are fools the counsel of the wise
counsellors of pharaoh is become brutish how say ye unto pharaoh i
am the son of the wise the son of ancient kings   where are
they where are thy wise men and let them tell thee now and let them
know what the lord of hosts hath purposed upon egypt
the princes of zoan are become fools the princes of noph are
deceived they have also seduced egypt even they that are the stay of
the tribes thereof
the lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof
and they have caused egypt to err in every work thereof as a drunken
man staggereth in his vomit
neither shall there be any work for egypt which the head or
tail branch or rush may do
in that day shall egypt be like unto women and it shall be
afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the lord of
hosts which he shaketh over it
and the land of judah shall be a terror unto egypt every one
that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself because of the
counsel of the lord of hosts which he hath determined against it
in that day shall five cities in the land of egypt speak the
language of canaan and swear to the lord of hosts one shall be
called the city of destruction
in that day shall there be an altar to the lord in the midst of
the land of egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to the lord
and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord of
hosts in the land of egypt for they shall cry unto the lord because
of the oppressors and he shall send them a saviour and a great one
and he shall deliver them
and the lord shall be known to egypt and the egyptians shall
know the lord in that day and shall do sacrifice and oblation yea
they shall vow a vow unto the lord and perform it
and the lord shall smite egypt he shall smite and heal it and
they shall return even to the lord and he shall be intreated of them
and shall heal them
in that day shall there be a highway out of egypt to assyria
and the assyrian shall come into egypt and the egyptian into assyria
and the egyptians shall serve with the assyrians
in that day shall israel be the third with egypt and with
assyria even a blessing in the midst of the land  whom the lord
of hosts shall bless saying blessed be egypt my people and assyria
the work of my hands and israel mine inheritance
in the year that tartan came unto ashdod when sargon the king
of assyria sent him and fought against ashdod and took it  at
the same time spake the lord by isaiah the son of amoz saying go and
loose the sackcloth from off thy loins and put off thy shoe from thy
foot and he did so walking naked and barefoot
and the lord said like as my servant isaiah hath walked naked
and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon egypt and upon
ethiopia  so shall the king of assyria lead away the egyptians
prisoners and the ethiopians captives young and old naked and
barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of egypt
and they shall be afraid and ashamed of ethiopia their
expectation and of egypt their glory
and the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day behold
such is our expectation whither we flee for help to be delivered from
the king of assyria and how shall we escape   the burden of the
desert of the sea as whirlwinds in the south pass through so it
cometh from the desert from a terrible land
a grievous vision is declared unto me the treacherous dealer
dealeth treacherously and the spoiler spoileth go up o elam
besiege o media all the sighing thereof have i made to cease
therefore are my loins filled with pain pangs have taken hold
upon me as the pangs of a woman that travaileth i was bowed down at
the hearing of it i was dismayed at the seeing of it
my heart panted fearfulness affrighted me the night of my
pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me
prepare the table watch in the watchtower eat drink arise ye
princes and anoint the shield
for thus hath the lord said unto me go set a watchman let him
declare what he seeth
and he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen a chariot of
asses and a chariot of camels and he hearkened diligently with much
heed  and he cried a lion my lord i stand continually upon the
watchtower in the daytime and i am set in my ward whole nights
and behold here cometh a chariot of men with a couple of horsemen
and he answered and said babylon is fallen is fallen and all the
graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground
o my threshing and the corn of my floor that which i have
heard of the lord of hosts the god of israel have i declared unto
you
the burden of dumah he calleth to me out of seir watchman
what of the night watchman what of the night   the watchman
said the morning cometh and also the night if ye will enquire
enquire ye return come
the burden upon arabia in the forest in arabia shall ye lodge
o ye travelling companies of dedanim
the inhabitants of the land of tema brought water to him that
was thirsty they prevented with their bread him that fled
for they fled from the swords from the drawn sword and from
the bent bow and from the grievousness of war
for thus hath the lord said unto me within a year according to
the years of an hireling and all the glory of kedar shall fail
and the residue of the number of archers the mighty men of the
children of kedar shall be diminished for the lord god of israel
hath spoken it
the burden of the valley of vision what aileth thee now that
thou art wholly gone up to the housetops   thou that art full of
stirs a tumultuous city joyous city thy slain men are not slain
with the sword nor dead in battle
all thy rulers are fled together they are bound by the archers
all that are found in thee are bound together which have fled from
far
therefore said i look away from me i will weep bitterly labour
not to comfort me because of the spoiling of the daughter of my
people
for it is a day of trouble and of treading down and of
perplexity by the lord god of hosts in the valley of vision breaking
down the walls and of crying to the mountains
and elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen and
kir uncovered the shield
and it shall come to pass that thy choicest valleys shall be
full of chariots and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at
the gate
and he discovered the covering of judah and thou didst look in
that day to the armour of the house of the forest
ye have seen also the breaches of the city of david that they
are many and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool
and ye have numbered the houses of jerusalem and the houses
have ye broken down to fortify the wall
ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the
old pool but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof neither had
respect unto him that fashioned it long ago
and in that day did the lord god of hosts call to weeping and
to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth  and
behold joy and gladness slaying oxen and killing sheep eating
flesh and drinking wine let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall
die
and it was revealed in mine ears by the lord of hosts surely
this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die saith the lord
god of hosts
thus saith the lord god of hosts go get thee unto this
treasurer even unto shebna which is over the house and say
what hast thou here and whom hast thou here that thou hast hewed
thee out a sepulchre here as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on
high and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock
behold the lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity and
will surely cover thee
he will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a
large country there shalt thou die and there the chariots of thy
glory shall be the shame of thy lords house
and i will drive thee from thy station and from thy state shall
he pull thee down
and it shall come to pass in that day that i will call my
servant eliakim the son of hilkiah  and i will clothe him with
thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle and i will commit thy
government into his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants
of jerusalem and to the house of judah
and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder
so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none
shall open
and i will fasten him as a nail in a sure place and he shall be
for a glorious throne to his fathers house
and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers
house the offspring and the issue all vessels of small quantity
from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of flagons
in that day saith the lord of hosts shall the nail that is
fastened in the sure place be removed and be cut down and fall and
the burden that was upon it shall be cut off for the lord hath spoken
it
the burden of tyre howl ye ships of tarshish for it is laid
waste so that there is no house no entering in from the land of
chittim it is revealed to them
be still ye inhabitants of the isle thou whom the merchants of
zidon that pass over the sea have replenished
and by great waters the seed of sihor the harvest of the river
is her revenue and she is a mart of nations
be thou ashamed o zidon for the sea hath spoken even the
strength of the sea saying i travail not nor bring forth children
neither do i nourish up young men nor bring up virgins
as at the report concerning egypt so shall they be sorely pained
at the report of tyre
pass ye over to tarshish howl ye inhabitants of the isle
is this your joyous city whose antiquity is of ancient days her
own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn
who hath taken this counsel against tyre the crowning city
whose merchants are princes whose traffickers are the honourable of
the earth   the lord of hosts hath purposed it to stain the
pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honourable of
the earth
pass through thy land as a river o daughter of tarshish there
is no more strength
he stretched out his hand over the sea he shook the kingdoms
the lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city to
destroy the strong holds thereof
and he said thou shalt no more rejoice o thou oppressed
virgin daughter of zidon arise pass over to chittim there also
shalt thou have no rest
behold the land of the chaldeans this people was not till the
assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness they set up
the towers thereof they raised up the palaces thereof and he brought
it to ruin
howl ye ships of tarshish for your strength is laid waste
and it shall come to pass in that day that tyre shall be
forgotten seventy years according to the days of one king after the
end of seventy years shall tyre sing as an harlot
take an harp go about the city thou harlot that hast been
forgotten make sweet melody sing many songs that thou mayest be
remembered
and it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years that
the lord will visit tyre and she shall turn to her hire and shall
commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of
the earth
and her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the lord
it shall not be treasured nor laid up for her merchandise shall be
for them that dwell before the lord to eat sufficiently and for
durable clothing
behold the lord maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste and
turneth it upside down and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof
and it shall be as with the people so with the priest as with
the servant so with his master as with the maid so with her
mistress as with the buyer so with the seller as with the lender
so with the borrower as with the taker of usury so with the giver of
usury to him
the land shall be utterly emptied and utterly spoiled for the
lord hath spoken this word
the earth mourneth and fadeth away the world languisheth and
fadeth away the haughty people of the earth do languish
the earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof because
they have transgressed the laws changed the ordinance broken the
everlasting covenant
therefore hath the curse devoured the earth and they that dwell
therein are desolate therefore the inhabitants of the earth are
burned and few men left
the new wine mourneth the vine languisheth all the merryhearted
do sigh
the mirth of tabrets ceaseth the noise of them that rejoice
endeth the joy of the harp ceaseth
they shall not drink wine with a song strong drink shall be
bitter to them that drink it
the city of confusion is broken down every house is shut up
that no man may come in
there is a crying for wine in the streets all joy is darkened
the mirth of the land is gone
in the city is left desolation and the gate is smitten with
destruction
when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people
there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree and as the gleaning
grapes when the vintage is done
they shall lift up their voice they shall sing for the majesty
of the lord they shall cry aloud from the sea
wherefore glorify ye the lord in the fires even the name of the
lord god of israel in the isles of the sea
from the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs even
glory to the righteous but i said my leanness my leanness woe unto
me the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously yea the
treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously
fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee o inhabitant of
the earth
and it shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the noise of
the fear shall fall into the pit and he that cometh up out of the
midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare for the windows from on
high are open and the foundations of the earth do shake
the earth is utterly broken down the earth is clean dissolved
the earth is moved exceedingly
the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be
removed like a cottage and the transgression thereof shall be heavy
upon it and it shall fall and not rise again
and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall
punish the host of the high ones that are on high and the kings of
the earth upon the earth
and they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered
in the pit and shall be shut up in the prison and after many days
shall they be visited
then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed when the
lord of hosts shall reign in mount zion and in jerusalem and before
his ancients gloriously
o lord thou art my god i will exalt thee i will praise thy
name for thou hast done wonderful things thy counsels of old are
faithfulness and truth
for thou hast made of a city an heap of a defenced city a ruin
a palace of strangers to be no city it shall never be built
therefore shall the strong people glorify thee the city of the
terrible nations shall fear thee
for thou hast been a strength to the poor a strength to the
needy in his distress a refuge from the storm a shadow from the
heat when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the
wall
thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers as the heat in a
dry place even the heat with the shadow of a cloud the branch of the
terrible ones shall be brought low
and in this mountain shall the lord of hosts make unto all people
a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the lees of fat things
full of marrow of wines on the lees well refined
and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
cast over all people and the vail that is spread over all nations
he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god will wipe
away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he
take away from off all the earth for the lord hath spoken it
and it shall be said in that day lo this is our god we have
waited for him and he will save us this is the lord we have waited
for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation
for in this mountain shall the hand of the lord rest and moab
shall be trodden down under him even as straw is trodden down for the
dunghill
and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them as he
that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim and he shall bring
down their pride together with the spoils of their hands
and the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring
down lay low and bring to the ground even to the dust
in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah we have
a strong city salvation will god appoint for walls and bulwarks
open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the
truth may enter in
thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
thee because he trusteth in thee
trust ye in the lord for ever for in the lord jehovah is
everlasting strength  for he bringeth down them that dwell on
high the lofty city he layeth it low he layeth it low even to the
ground he bringeth it even to the dust
the foot shall tread it down even the feet of the poor and the
steps of the needy
the way of the just is uprightness thou most upright dost
weigh the path of the just
yea in the way of thy judgments o lord have we waited for
thee the desire of our soul is to thy name and to the remembrance of
thee
with my soul have i desired thee in the night yea with my
spirit within me will i seek thee early for when thy judgments are in
the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness
let favour be shewed to the wicked yet will he not learn
righteousness in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly and
will not behold the majesty of the lord
lord when thy hand is lifted up they will not see but they
shall see and be ashamed for their envy at the people yea the fire
of thine enemies shall devour them
lord thou wilt ordain peace for us for thou also hast wrought
all our works in us
o lord our god other lords beside thee have had dominion over
us but by thee only will we make mention of thy name
they are dead they shall not live they are deceased they
shall not rise therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them and
made all their memory to perish
thou hast increased the nation o lord thou hast increased the
nation thou art glorified thou hadst removed it far unto all the
ends of the earth
lord in trouble have they visited thee they poured out a
prayer when thy chastening was upon them
like as a woman with child that draweth near the time of her
delivery is in pain and crieth out in her pangs so have we been in
thy sight o lord
we have been with child we have been in pain we have as it
were brought forth wind we have not wrought any deliverance in the
earth neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen
thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they
arise awake and sing ye that dwell in dust for thy dew is as the
dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead
come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy
doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until
the indignation be overpast
for behold the lord cometh out of his place to punish the
inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall
disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain
in that day the lord with his sore and great and strong sword
shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent even leviathan that
crooked serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea
in that day sing ye unto her a vineyard of red wine
i the lord do keep it i will water it every moment lest any
hurt it i will keep it night and day
fury is not in me who would set the briers and thorns against me
in battle i would go through them i would burn them together
or let him take hold of my strength that he may make peace with
me and he shall make peace with me
he shall cause them that come of jacob to take root israel shall
blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit
hath he smitten him as he smote those that smote him or is he
slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him
in measure when it shooteth forth thou wilt debate with it he
stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind
by this therefore shall the iniquity of jacob be purged and this
is all the fruit to take away his sin when he maketh all the stones
of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder the groves and
images shall not stand up
yet the defenced city shall be desolate and the habitation
forsaken and left like a wilderness there shall the calf feed and
there shall he lie down and consume the branches thereof
when the boughs thereof are withered they shall be broken off
the women come and set them on fire for it is a people of no
understanding therefore he that made them will not have mercy on
them and he that formed them will shew them no favour
and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall beat
off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt and ye
shall be gathered one by one o ye children of israel
and it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet
shall be blown and they shall come which were ready to perish in the
land of assyria and the outcasts in the land of egypt and shall
worship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem
woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of ephraim whose
glorious beauty is a fading flower which are on the head of the fat
valleys of them that are overcome with wine   behold the lord
hath a mighty and strong one which as a tempest of hail and a
destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters overflowing shall cast
down to the earth with the hand
the crown of pride the drunkards of ephraim shall be trodden
under feet  and the glorious beauty which is on the head of the
fat valley shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before
the summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet
in his hand he eateth it up
in that day shall the lord of hosts be for a crown of glory and
for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people  and for a
spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength
to them that turn the battle to the gate
but they also have erred through wine and through strong drink
are out of the way the priest and the prophet have erred through
strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way
through strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment
for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is
no place clean
whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to
understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn
from the breasts
for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line
upon line line upon line here a little and there a little
for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this
people
to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear
but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept
precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little
and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be
broken and snared and taken
wherefore hear the word of the lord ye scornful men that rule
this people which is in jerusalem
because ye have said we have made a covenant with death and
with hell are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass
through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge
and under falsehood have we hid ourselves  therefore thus saith
the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried
stone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believeth
shall not make haste
judgment also will i lay to the line and righteousness to the
plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the
waters shall overflow the hiding place
and your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your
agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourge
shall pass through then ye shall be trodden down by it
from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you for morning
by morning shall it pass over by day and by night and it shall be a
vexation only to understand the report
for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
it and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it
for the lord shall rise up as in mount perazim he shall be
wroth as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange
work and bring to pass his act his strange act
now therefore be ye not mockers lest your bands be made strong
for i have heard from the lord god of hosts a consumption even
determined upon the whole earth
give ye ear and hear my voice hearken and hear my speech
doth the plowman plow all day to sow doth he open and break the
clods of his ground   when he hath made plain the face thereof
doth he not cast abroad the fitches and scatter the cummin and cast
in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their
place   for his god doth instruct him to discretion and doth
teach him
for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument
neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin but the fitches
are beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod
bread corn is bruised because he will not ever be threshing it
nor break it with the wheel of his cart nor bruise it with his
horsemen
this also cometh forth from the lord of hosts which is
wonderful in counsel and excellent in working
woe to ariel to ariel the city where david dwelt add ye year
to year let them kill sacrifices
yet i will distress ariel and there shall be heaviness and
sorrow and it shall be unto me as ariel
and i will camp against thee round about and will lay siege
against thee with a mount and i will raise forts against thee
and thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the
ground and thy speech shall be low out of the dust and thy voice
shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the ground
and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust
moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust
and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth
away yea it shall be at an instant suddenly
thou shalt be visited of the lord of hosts with thunder and with
earthquake and great noise with storm and tempest and the flame of
devouring fire
and the multitude of all the nations that fight against ariel
even all that fight against her and her munition and that distress
her shall be as a dream of a night vision
it shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth and behold he
eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty or as when a thirsty
man dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold
he is faint and his soul hath appetite so shall the multitude of all
the nations be that fight against mount zion
stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they are
drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink
for the lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep
and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers
hath he covered
and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book
that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read
this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed  and
the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i
pray thee and he saith i am not learned
wherefore the lord said forasmuch as this people draw near me
with their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removed
their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the
precept of men  therefore behold i will proceed to do a
marvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and a
wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the
understanding of their prudent men shall be hid
woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
lord and their works are in the dark and they say who seeth us and
who knoweth us   surely your turning of things upside down shall
be esteemed as the potters clay for shall the work say of him that
made it he made me not or shall the thing framed say of him that
framed it he had no understanding   is it not yet a very little
while and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the
fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest   and in that day
shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind
shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness
the meek also shall increase their joy in the lord and the poor
among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel
for the terrible one is brought to nought and the scorner is
consumed and all that watch for iniquity are cut off  that make
a man an offender for a word and lay a snare for him that reproveth
in the gate and turn aside the just for a thing of nought
therefore thus saith the lord who redeemed abraham concerning
the house of jacob jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall his
face now wax pale
but when he seeth his children the work of mine hands in the
midst of him they shall sanctify my name and sanctify the holy one
of jacob and shall fear the god of israel
they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding and
they that murmured shall learn doctrine
woe to the rebellious children saith the lord that take
counsel but not of me and that cover with a covering but not of my
spirit that they may add sin to sin  that walk to go down into
egypt and have not asked at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the
strength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of egypt
therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the trust
in the shadow of egypt your confusion
for his princes were at zoan and his ambassadors came to hanes
they were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them nor
be an help nor profit but a shame and also a reproach
the burden of the beasts of the south into the land of trouble
and anguish from whence come the young and old lion the viper and
fiery flying serpent they will carry their riches upon the shoulders
of young asses and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to a
people that shall not profit them
for the egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose
therefore have i cried concerning this their strength is to sit
still
now go write it before them in a table and note it in a book
that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever  that this
is a rebellious people lying children children that will not hear
the law of the lord  which say to the seers see not and to the
prophets prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth
things prophesy deceits  get you out of the way turn aside out
of the path cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us
wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because ye despise
this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay thereon
therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to
fall swelling out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly at
an instant
and he shall break it as the breaking of the potters vessel
that is broken in pieces he shall not spare so that there shall not
be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth
or to take water withal out of the pit
for thus saith the lord god the holy one of israel in
returning and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidence
shall be your strength and ye would not
but ye said no for we will flee upon horses therefore shall
ye flee and we will ride upon the swift therefore shall they that
pursue you be swift
one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke of
five shall ye flee till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a
mountain and as an ensign on an hill
and therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious unto
you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon
you for the lord is a god of judgment blessed are all they that wait
for him
for the people shall dwell in zion at jerusalem thou shalt weep
no more he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry
when he shall hear it he will answer thee
and though the lord give you the bread of adversity and the
water of affliction yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a
corner any more but thine eyes shall see thy teachers  and
thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the way
walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the
left
ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
silver and the ornament of thy molten images of gold thou shalt cast
them away as a menstruous cloth thou shalt say unto it get thee
hence
then shall he give the rain of thy seed that thou shalt sow the
ground withal and bread of the increase of the earth and it shall be
fat and plenteous in that day shall thy cattle feed in large
pastures
the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall
eat clean provender which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with
the fan
and there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high
hill rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter
when the towers fall
moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun
and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven
days in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his people
and healeth the stroke of their wound
behold the name of the lord cometh from far burning with his
anger and the burden thereof is heavy his lips are full of
indignation and his tongue as a devouring fire  and his breath
as an overflowing stream shall reach to the midst of the neck to
sift the nations with the sieve of vanity and there shall be a bridle
in the jaws of the people causing them to err
ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy solemnity is
kept and gladness of heart as when one goeth with a pipe to come
into the mountain of the lord to the mighty one of israel
and the lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard and
shall shew the lighting down of his arm with the indignation of his
anger and with the flame of a devouring fire with scattering and
tempest and hailstones
for through the voice of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten
down which smote with a rod
and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass which
the lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabrets and harps and
in battles of shaking will he fight with it
for tophet is ordained of old yea for the king it is prepared
he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and much
wood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle
it
woe to them that go down to egypt for help and stay on horses
and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because
they are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel
neither seek the lord   yet he also is wise and will bring evil
and will not call back his words but will arise against the house of
the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity
now the egyptians are men and not god and their horses flesh
and not spirit when the lord shall stretch out his hand both he that
helpeth shall fall and he that is holpen shall fall down and they
all shall fail together
for thus hath the lord spoken unto me like as the lion and the
young lion roaring on his prey when a multitude of shepherds is
called forth against him he will not be afraid of their voice nor
abase himself for the noise of them so shall the lord of hosts come
down to fight for mount zion and for the hill thereof
as birds flying so will the lord of hosts defend jerusalem
defending also he will deliver it and passing over he will preserve
it
turn ye unto him from whom the children of israel have deeply
revolted
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver
and his idols of gold which your own hands have made unto you for a
sin
then shall the assyrian fall with the sword not of a mighty man
and the sword not of a mean man shall devour him but he shall flee
from the sword and his young men shall be discomfited
and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear and his
princes shall be afraid of the ensign saith the lord whose fire is
in zion and his furnace in jerusalem
behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall
rule in judgment
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and a covert
from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of
a great rock in a weary land
and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears of
them that hear shall hearken
the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge and the
tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly
the vile person shall be no more called liberal nor the churl
said to be bountiful
for the vile person will speak villany and his heart will work
iniquity to practise hypocrisy and to utter error against the lord
to make empty the soul of the hungry and he will cause the drink of
the thirsty to fail
the instruments also of the churl are evil he deviseth wicked
devices to destroy the poor with lying words even when the needy
speaketh right
but the liberal deviseth liberal things and by liberal things
shall he stand
rise up ye women that are at ease hear my voice ye careless
daughters give ear unto my speech
many days and years shall ye be troubled ye careless women for
the vintage shall fail the gathering shall not come
tremble ye women that are at ease be troubled ye careless
ones strip you and make you bare and gird sackcloth upon your
loins
they shall lament for the teats for the pleasant fields for
the fruitful vine
upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers yea
upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city  because the
palaces shall be forsaken the multitude of the city shall be left
the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever a joy of wild asses
a pasture of flocks  until the spirit be poured upon us from on
high and the wilderness be a fruitful field and the fruitful field
be counted for a forest
then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness and righteousness
remain in the fruitful field
and the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of
righteousness quietness and assurance for ever
and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and in sure
dwellings and in quiet resting places  when it shall hail
coming down on the forest and the city shall be low in a low place
blessed are ye that sow beside all waters that send forth
thither the feet of the ox and the ass
woe to thee that spoilest and thou wast not spoiled and dealest
treacherously and they dealt not treacherously with thee when thou
shalt cease to spoil thou shalt be spoiled and when thou shalt make
an end to deal treacherously they shall deal treacherously with thee
o lord be gracious unto us we have waited for thee be thou
their arm every morning our salvation also in the time of trouble
at the noise of the tumult the people fled at the lifting up of
thyself the nations were scattered
and your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the
caterpiller as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon
them
the lord is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled zion
with judgment and righteousness
and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and
strength of salvation the fear of the lord is his treasure
behold their valiant ones shall cry without the ambassadors of
peace shall weep bitterly
the highways lie waste the wayfaring man ceaseth he hath broken
the covenant he hath despised the cities he regardeth no man
the earth mourneth and languisheth lebanon is ashamed and hewn
down sharon is like a wilderness and bashan and carmel shake off
their fruits
now will i rise saith the lord now will i be exalted now will
i lift up myself
ye shall conceive chaff ye shall bring forth stubble your
breath as fire shall devour you
and the people shall be as the burnings of lime as thorns cut
up shall they be burned in the fire
hear ye that are far off what i have done and ye that are
near acknowledge my might
the sinners in zion are afraid fearfulness hath surprised the
hypocrites who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire who
among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings   he that walketh
righteously and speaketh uprightly he that despiseth the gain of
oppressions that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes that
stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood and shutteth his eyes from
seeing evil  he shall dwell on high his place of defence shall
be the munitions of rocks bread shall be given him his waters shall
be sure
thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty they shall behold
the land that is very far off
thine heart shall meditate terror where is the scribe where is
the receiver where is he that counted the towers   thou shalt
not see a fierce people a people of a deeper speech than thou canst
perceive of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understand
look upon zion the city of our solemnities thine eyes shall
see jerusalem a quiet habitation a tabernacle that shall not be taken
down not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed neither
shall any of the cords thereof be broken
but there the glorious lord will be unto us a place of broad
rivers and streams wherein shall go no galley with oars neither
shall gallant ship pass thereby
for the lord is our judge the lord is our lawgiver the lord is
our king he will save us
thy tacklings are loosed they could not well strengthen their
mast they could not spread the sail then is the prey of a great
spoil divided the lame take the prey
and the inhabitant shall not say i am sick the people that
dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity
come near ye nations to hear and hearken ye people let the
earth hear and all that is therein the world and all things that
come forth of it
for the indignation of the lord is upon all nations and his fury
upon all their armies he hath utterly destroyed them he hath
delivered them to the slaughter
their slain also shall be cast out and their stink shall come up
out of their carcases and the mountains shall be melted with their
blood
and all the host of heaven shall be dissolved and the heavens
shall be rolled together as a scroll and all their host shall fall
down as the leaf falleth off from the vine and as a falling fig from
the fig tree
for my sword shall be bathed in heaven behold it shall come
down upon idumea and upon the people of my curse to judgment
the sword of the lord is filled with blood it is made fat with
fatness and with the blood of lambs and goats with the fat of the
kidneys of rams for the lord hath a sacrifice in bozrah and a great
slaughter in the land of idumea
and the unicorns shall come down with them and the bullocks with
the bulls and their land shall be soaked with blood and their dust
made fat with fatness
for it is the day of the lords vengeance and the year of
recompences for the controversy of zion
and the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch and the dust
thereof into brimstone and the land thereof shall become burning
pitch
it shall not be quenched night nor day the smoke thereof shall
go up for ever from generation to generation it shall lie waste none
shall pass through it for ever and ever
but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it the owl also
and the raven shall dwell in it and he shall stretch out upon it the
line of confusion and the stones of emptiness
they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom but none
shall be there and all her princes shall be nothing
and thorns shall come up in her palaces nettles and brambles in
the fortresses thereof and it shall be an habitation of dragons and
a court for owls
the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild
beasts of the island and the satyr shall cry to his fellow the
screech owl also shall rest there and find for herself a place of
rest
there shall the great owl make her nest and lay and hatch and
gather under her shadow there shall the vultures also be gathered
every one with her mate
seek ye out of the book of the lord and read no one of these
shall fail none shall want her mate for my mouth it hath commanded
and his spirit it hath gathered them
and he hath cast the lot for them and his hand hath divided it
unto them by line they shall possess it for ever from generation to
generation shall they dwell therein
the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and
the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose
it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and
singing the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it the excellency
of carmel and sharon they shall see the glory of the lord and the
excellency of our god
strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees
say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not
behold your god will come with vengeance even god with a recompence
he will come and save you
then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the
deaf shall be unstopped
then shall the lame man leap as an hart and the tongue of the
dumb sing for in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams
in the desert
and the parched ground shall become a pool and the thirsty land
springs of water in the habitation of dragons where each lay shall
be grass with reeds and rushes
and an highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called
the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall
be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not err therein
no lion shall be there nor any ravenous beast shall go up
thereon it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk
there  and the ransomed of the lord shall return and come to
zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads they shall
obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away
now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that
sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the defenced cities of
judah and took them
and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem
unto king hezekiah with a great army and he stood by the conduit of
the upper pool in the highway of the fullers field
then came forth unto him eliakim hilkiahs son which was over
the house and shebna the scribe and joah asaphs son the recorder
and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saith
the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein
thou trustest   i say sayest thou but they are but vain words
i have counsel and strength for war now on whom dost thou trust that
thou rebellest against me   lo thou trustest in the staff of
this broken reed on egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his
hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in
him
but if thou say to me we trust in the lord our god is it not
he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and
said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar
now therefore give pledges i pray thee to my master the king of
assyria and i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on
thy part to set riders upon them
how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least
of my masters servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and
for horsemen   and am i now come up without the lord against
this land to destroy it the lord said unto me go up against this
land and destroy it
then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i
pray thee unto thy servants in the syrian language for we understand
it and speak not to us in the jews language in the ears of the
people that are on the wall
but rabshakeh said hath my master sent me to thy master and to
thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men that sit
upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own
piss with you   then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud
voice in the jews language and said hear ye the words of the great
king the king of assyria
thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall
not be able to deliver you
neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the
lord will surely deliver us this city shall not be delivered into the
hand of the king of assyria
hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria
make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and eat ye
every one of his vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye
every one the waters of his own cistern  until i come and take
you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land
of bread and vineyards
beware lest hezekiah persuade you saying the lord will deliver
us
hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand
of the king of assyria   where are the gods of hamath and
arphad where are the gods of sepharvaim and have they delivered
samaria out of my hand   who are they among all the gods of
these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that the
lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand   but they held
their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandment
was saying answer him not
then came eliakim the son of hilkiah that was over the
household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the
recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words
of rabshakeh
and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent
his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the
house of the lord
and he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna the
scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto
isaiah the prophet the son of amoz
and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of
trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come to
the birth and there is not strength to bring forth
it may be the lord thy god will hear the words of rabshakeh whom
the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god
and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard
wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left
so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah
and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say unto your master
thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard
wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me
behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour
and return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword
in his own land
so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring
against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish
and he heard say concerning tirhakah king of ethiopia he is come
forth to make war with thee and when he heard it he sent messengers
to hezekiah saying  thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of
judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee
saying jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of
assyria
behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to
all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered
have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of
eden which were in telassar   where is the king of hamath and
the king of arphad and the king of the city of sepharvaim hena and
ivah   and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the
messengers and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of the
lord and spread it before the lord
and hezekiah prayed unto the lord saying  o lord of
hosts god of israel that dwellest between the cherubims thou art
the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast
made heaven and earth
incline thine ear o lord and hear open thine eyes o lord
and see and hear all the words of sennacherib which hath sent to
reproach the living god
of a truth lord the kings of assyria have laid waste all the
nations and their countries  and have cast their gods into the
fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and
stone therefore they have destroyed them
now therefore o lord our god save us from his hand that all
the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thou
only
then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah saying thus
saith the lord god of israel whereas thou hast prayed to me against
sennacherib king of assyria  this is the word which the lord
hath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hath
despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem
hath shaken her head at thee
whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast
thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against
the holy one of israel
by thy servants hast thou reproached the lord and hast said by
the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the
mountains to the sides of lebanon and i will cut down the tall
cedars thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter
into the height of his border and the forest of his carmel
i have digged and drunk water and with the sole of my feet
have i dried up all the rivers of the besieged places
hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient
times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou
shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps
therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were
dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as
the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blasted
before it be grown up
but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and
thy rage against me
because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into
mine ears therefore will i put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in
thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest
and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such
as groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of the
same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and
eat the fruit thereof
and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall
again take root downward and bear fruit upward  for out of
jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount
zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he
shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come
before it with shields nor cast a bank against it
by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall
not come into this city saith the lord
for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and
for my servant davids sake
then the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp of
the assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand and when they
arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses
so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned
and dwelt at nineveh
and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of
nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with
the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon
his son reigned in his stead
in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah the
prophet the son of amoz came unto him and said unto him thus saith
the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live
then hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed unto
the lord  and said remember now o lord i beseech thee how i
have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have
done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore
then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying  go and
say to hezekiah thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i
have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto
thy days fifteen years
and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king
of assyria and i will defend this city
and this shall be a sign unto thee from the lord that the lord
will do this thing that he hath spoken  behold i will bring
again the shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the sun dial of
ahaz ten degrees backward so the sun returned ten degrees by which
degrees it was gone down
the writing of hezekiah king of judah when he had been sick and
was recovered of his sickness  i said in the cutting off of my
days i shall go to the gates of the grave i am deprived of the
residue of my years
i said i shall not see the lord even the lord in the land of
the living i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the
world
mine age is departed and is removed from me as a shepherds
tent i have cut off like a weaver my life he will cut me off with
pining sickness from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me
i reckoned till morning that as a lion so will he break all
my bones from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me
like a crane or a swallow so did i chatter i did mourn as a
dove mine eyes fail with looking upward o lord i am oppressed
undertake for me
what shall i say he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath
done it i shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul
o lord by these things men live and in all these things is the
life of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to live
behold for peace i had great bitterness but thou hast in love
to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou hast cast
all my sins behind thy back
for the grave cannot praise thee death can not celebrate thee
they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth
the living the living he shall praise thee as i do this day
the father to the children shall make known thy truth
the lord was ready to save me therefore we will sing my songs
to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of
the lord
for isaiah had said let them take a lump of figs and lay it
for a plaister upon the boil and he shall recover
hezekiah also had said what is the sign that i shall go up to
the house of the lord   at that time merodachbaladan the son of
baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present to hezekiah for
he had heard that he had been sick and was recovered
and hezekiah was glad of them and shewed them the house of his
precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the
precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was
found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his
dominion that hezekiah shewed them not
then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto
him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and
hezekiah said they are come from a far country unto me even from
babylon
then said he what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah
answered all that is in mine house have they seen there is nothing
among my treasures that i have not shewed them
then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the word of the lord of hosts
behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that
which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be
carried to babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt
beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace
of the king of babylon
then said hezekiah to isaiah good is the word of the lord which
thou hast spoken he said moreover for there shall be peace and truth
in my days
comfort ye comfort ye my people saith your god
speak ye comfortably to jerusalem and cry unto her that her
warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she hath
received of the lords hand double for all her sins
the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the
way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god
every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall
be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough
places plain  and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and
all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken
it
the voice said cry and he said what shall i cry all flesh is
grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field
the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of the
lord bloweth upon it surely the people is grass
the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god
shall stand for ever
o zion that bringest good tidings get thee up into the high
mountain o jerusalem that bringest good tidings lift up thy voice
with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of
judah behold your god   behold the lord god will come with
strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is
with him and his work before him
he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather the
lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead
those that are with young
who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and
meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth
in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a
balance   who hath directed the spirit of the lord or being his
counsellor hath taught him   with whom took he counsel and who
instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him
knowledge and shewed to him the way of understanding   behold
the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small
dust of the balance behold he taketh up the isles as a very little
thing
and lebanon is not sufficient to burn nor the beasts thereof
sufficient for a burnt offering
all nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to
him less than nothing and vanity
to whom then will ye liken god or what likeness will ye compare
unto him   the workman melteth a graven image and the goldsmith
spreadeth it over with gold and casteth silver chains
he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a
tree that will not rot he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to
prepare a graven image that shall not be moved
have ye not known have ye not heard hath it not been told you
from the beginning have ye not understood from the foundations of the
earth   it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and
the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the
heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in
that bringeth the princes to nothing he maketh the judges of
the earth as vanity
yea they shall not be planted yea they shall not be sown
yea their stock shall not take root in the earth and he shall also
blow upon them and they shall wither and the whirlwind shall take
them away as stubble
to whom then will ye liken me or shall i be equal saith the
holy one
lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these
things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by
names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power
not one faileth
why sayest thou o jacob and speakest o israel my way is hid
from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god   hast
thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the
lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is
weary there is no searching of his understanding
he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he
increaseth strength
even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men
shall utterly fall  but they that wait upon the lord shall renew
their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall
run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint
keep silence before me o islands and let the people renew their
strength let them come near then let them speak let us come near
together to judgment
who raised up the righteous man from the east called him to his
foot gave the nations before him and made him rule over kings he
gave them as the dust to his sword and as driven stubble to his bow
he pursued them and passed safely even by the way that he had
not gone with his feet
who hath wrought and done it calling the generations from the
beginning i the lord the first and with the last i am he
the isles saw it and feared the ends of the earth were afraid
drew near and came
they helped every one his neighbour and every one said to his
brother be of good courage
so the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith and he that smootheth
with the hammer him that smote the anvil saying it is ready for the
sodering and he fastened it with nails that it should not be moved
but thou israel art my servant jacob whom i have chosen the
seed of abraham my friend
thou whom i have taken from the ends of the earth and called
thee from the chief men thereof and said unto thee thou art my
servant i have chosen thee and not cast thee away
fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy
god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold
thee with the right hand of my righteousness
behold all they that were incensed against thee shall be
ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing and they that strive
with thee shall perish
thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them even them that
contended with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing
and as a thing of nought
for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto
thee fear not i will help thee
fear not thou worm jacob and ye men of israel i will help
thee saith the lord and thy redeemer the holy one of israel
behold i will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having
teeth thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small and shalt
make the hills as chaff
thou shalt fan them and the wind shall carry them away and the
whirlwind shall scatter them and thou shalt rejoice in the lord and
shalt glory in the holy one of israel
when the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their
tongue faileth for thirst i the lord will hear them i the god of
israel will not forsake them
i will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of
the valleys i will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry
land springs of water
i will plant in the wilderness the cedar the shittah tree and
the myrtle and the oil tree i will set in the desert the fir tree
and the pine and the box tree together  that they may see and
know and consider and understand together that the hand of the lord
hath done this and the holy one of israel hath created it
produce your cause saith the lord bring forth your strong
reasons saith the king of jacob
let them bring them forth and shew us what shall happen let
them shew the former things what they be that we may consider them
and know the latter end of them or declare us things for to come
shew the things that are to come hereafter that we may know
that ye are gods yea do good or do evil that we may be dismayed
and behold it together
behold ye are of nothing and your work of nought an
abomination is he that chooseth you
i have raised up one from the north and he shall come from the
rising of the sun shall he call upon my name and he shall come upon
princes as upon morter and as the potter treadeth clay
who hath declared from the beginning that we may know and
beforetime that we may say he is righteous yea there is none that
sheweth yea there is none that declareth yea there is none that
heareth your words
the first shall say to zion behold behold them and i will
give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings
for i beheld and there was no man even among them and there
was no counsellor that when i asked of them could answer a word
behold they are all vanity their works are nothing their
molten images are wind and confusion
behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul
delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth
judgment to the gentiles
he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in
the street
a bruised reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he
not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth
he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment
in the earth and the isles shall wait for his law
thus saith god the lord he that created the heavens and
stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which
cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and
spirit to them that walk therein  i the lord have called thee in
righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give
thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles
to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison
and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house
i am the lord that is my name and my glory will i not give to
another neither my praise to graven images
behold the former things are come to pass and new things do i
declare before they spring forth i tell you of them
sing unto the lord a new song and his praise from the end of
the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the
isles and the inhabitants thereof
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice
the villages that kedar doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the rock
sing let them shout from the top of the mountains
let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the
islands
the lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up
jealousy like a man of war he shall cry yea roar he shall prevail
against his enemies
i have long time holden my peace i have been still and
refrained myself now will i cry like a travailing woman i will
destroy and devour at once
i will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their
herbs and i will make the rivers islands and i will dry up the
pools
and i will bring the blind by a way that they knew not i will
lead them in paths that they have not known i will make darkness
light before them and crooked things straight these things will i do
unto them and not forsake them
they shall be turned back they shall be greatly ashamed that
trust in graven images that say to the molten images ye are our
gods
hear ye deaf and look ye blind that ye may see
who is blind but my servant or deaf as my messenger that i
sent  who is blind as he that is perfect and blind as the lords
servant   seeing many things but thou observest not opening
the ears but he heareth not
the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will
magnify the law and make it honourable
but this is a people robbed and spoiled they are all of them
snared in holes and they are hid in prison houses they are for a
prey and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith restore
who among you will give ear to this who will hearken and hear
for the time to come   who gave jacob for a spoil and israel to
the robbers did not the lord he against whom we have sinned for
they would not walk in his ways neither were they obedient unto his
law
therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger and the
strength of battle and it hath set him on fire round about yet he
knew not and it burned him yet he laid it not to heart
but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he
that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have
called thee by thy name thou art mine
when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and
through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest
through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee
for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour i
gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and seba for thee
since thou wast precious in my sight thou hast been honourable
and i have loved thee therefore will i give men for thee and people
for thy life
fear not for i am with thee i will bring thy seed from the
east and gather thee from the west  i will say to the north
give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and
my daughters from the ends of the earth  even every one that is
called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed
him yea i have made him
bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that
have ears
let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be
assembled who among them can declare this and shew us former things
let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or
let them hear and say it is truth
ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have
chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he
before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me
i even i am the lord and beside me there is no saviour
i have declared and have saved and i have shewed when there
was no strange god among you therefore ye are my witnesses saith the
lord that i am god
yea before the day was i am he and there is none that can
deliver out of my hand i will work and who shall let it   thus
saith the lord your redeemer the holy one of israel for your sake i
have sent to babylon and have brought down all their nobles and the
chaldeans whose cry is in the ships
i am the lord your holy one the creator of israel your king
thus saith the lord which maketh a way in the sea and a path
in the mighty waters  which bringeth forth the chariot and
horse the army and the power they shall lie down together they
shall not rise they are extinct they are quenched as tow
remember ye not the former things neither consider the things
of old
behold i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall
ye not know it i will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers
in the desert
the beast of the field shall honour me the dragons and the
owls because i give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the
desert to give drink to my people my chosen
this people have i formed for myself they shall shew forth my
praise
but thou hast not called upon me o jacob but thou hast been
weary of me o israel
thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt
offerings neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices i have
not caused thee to serve with an offering nor wearied thee with
incense
thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money neither hast thou
filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices but thou hast made me to
serve with thy sins thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities
i even i am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
own sake and will not remember thy sins
put me in remembrance let us plead together declare thou that
thou mayest be justified
thy first father hath sinned and thy teachers have transgressed
against me
therefore i have profaned the princes of the sanctuary and have
given jacob to the curse and israel to reproaches
yet now hear o jacob my servant and israel whom i have chosen
thus saith the lord that made thee and formed thee from the
womb which will help thee fear not o jacob my servant and thou
jesurun whom i have chosen
for i will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon
the dry ground i will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing
upon thine offspring  and they shall spring up as among the
grass as willows by the water courses
one shall say i am the lords and another shall call himself by
the name of jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the
lord and surname himself by the name of israel
thus saith the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord
of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no
god
and who as i shall call and shall declare it and set it in
order for me since i appointed the ancient people and the things
that are coming and shall come let them shew unto them
fear ye not neither be afraid have not i told thee from that
time and have declared it ye are even my witnesses is there a god
beside me yea there is no god i know not any
they that make a graven image are all of them vanity and their
delectable things shall not profit and they are their own witnesses
they see not nor know that they may be ashamed
who hath formed a god or molten a graven image that is
profitable for nothing   behold all his fellows shall be
ashamed and the workmen they are of men let them all be gathered
together let them stand up yet they shall fear and they shall be
ashamed together
the smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals and
fashioneth it with hammers and worketh it with the strength of his
arms yea he is hungry and his strength faileth he drinketh no
water and is faint
the carpenter stretcheth out his rule he marketh it out with a
line he fitteth it with planes and he marketh it out with the
compass and maketh it after the figure of a man according to the
beauty of a man that it may remain in the house
he heweth him down cedars and taketh the cypress and the oak
which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest he
planteth an ash and the rain doth nourish it
then shall it be for a man to burn for he will take thereof
and warm himself yea he kindleth it and baketh bread yea he
maketh a god and worshippeth it he maketh it a graven image and
falleth down thereto
he burneth part thereof in the fire with part thereof he eateth
flesh he roasteth roast and is satisfied yea he warmeth himself
and saith aha i am warm i have seen the fire  and the residue
thereof he maketh a god even his graven image he falleth down unto
it and worshippeth it and prayeth unto it and saith deliver me
for thou art my god
they have not known nor understood for he hath shut their eyes
that they cannot see and their hearts that they cannot understand
and none considereth in his heart neither is there knowledge
nor understanding to say i have burned part of it in the fire yea
also i have baked bread upon the coals thereof i have roasted flesh
and eaten it and shall i make the residue thereof an abomination
shall i fall down to the stock of a tree   he feedeth on ashes
a deceived heart hath turned him aside that he cannot deliver his
soul nor say is there not a lie in my right hand   remember
these o jacob and israel for thou art my servant i have formed
thee thou art my servant o israel thou shalt not be forgotten of
me
i have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and
as a cloud thy sins return unto me for i have redeemed thee
sing o ye heavens for the lord hath done it shout ye lower
parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains o forest
and every tree therein for the lord hath redeemed jacob and
glorified himself in israel
thus saith the lord thy redeemer and he that formed thee from
the womb i am the lord that maketh all things that stretcheth forth
the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself
that frustrateth the tokens of the liars and maketh diviners mad
that turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledge foolish
that confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the
counsel of his messengers that saith to jerusalem thou shalt be
inhabited and to the cities of judah ye shall be built and i will
raise up the decayed places thereof  that saith to the deep be
dry and i will dry up thy rivers  that saith of cyrus he is my
shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusalem
thou shalt be built and to the temple thy foundation shall be laid
thus saith the lord to his anointed to cyrus whose right hand i
have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins
of kings to open before him the two leaved gates and the gates shall
not be shut  i will go before thee and make the crooked places
straight i will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder
the bars of iron  and i will give thee the treasures of darkness
and hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that i the
lord which call thee by thy name am the god of israel
for jacob my servants sake and israel mine elect i have even
called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee though thou hast not
known me
i am the lord and there is none else there is no god beside me
i girded thee though thou hast not known me  that they may know
from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none
beside me i am the lord and there is none else
i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create
evil i the lord do all these things
drop down ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down
righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation
and let righteousness spring up together i the lord have created it
woe unto him that striveth with his maker let the potsherd
strive with the potsherds of the earth shall the clay say to him that
fashioneth it what makest thou or thy work he hath no hands
woe unto him that saith unto his father what begettest thou or to
the woman what hast thou brought forth   thus saith the lord
the holy one of israel and his maker ask me of things to come
concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me
i have made the earth and created man upon it i even my
hands have stretched out the heavens and all their host have i
commanded
i have raised him up in righteousness and i will direct all his
ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives not for
price nor reward saith the lord of hosts
thus saith the lord the labour of egypt and merchandise of
ethiopia and of the sabeans men of stature shall come over unto
thee and they shall be thine they shall come after thee in chains
they shall come over and they shall fall down unto thee they shall
make supplication unto thee saying surely god is in thee and there
is none else there is no god
verily thou art a god that hidest thyself o god of israel the
saviour
they shall be ashamed and also confounded all of them they
shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols
but israel shall be saved in the lord with an everlasting
salvation ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end
for thus saith the lord that created the heavens god himself
that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he created
it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited i am the lord and there
is none else
i have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth i
said not unto the seed of jacob seek ye me in vain i the lord speak
righteousness i declare things that are right
assemble yourselves and come draw near together ye that are
escaped of the nations they have no knowledge that set up the wood of
their graven image and pray unto a god that cannot save
tell ye and bring them near yea let them take counsel
together who hath declared this from ancient time who hath told it
from that time  have not i the lord and there is no god else beside
me a just god and a saviour there is none beside me
look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i
am god and there is none else
i have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth in
righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall
bow every tongue shall swear
surely shall one say in the lord have i righteousness and
strength even to him shall men come and all that are incensed
against him shall be ashamed
in the lord shall all the seed of israel be justified and shall
glory
bel boweth down nebo stoopeth their idols were upon the beasts
and upon the cattle your carriages were heavy loaden they are a
burden to the weary beast
they stoop they bow down together they could not deliver the
burden but themselves are gone into captivity
hearken unto me o house of jacob and all the remnant of the
house of israel which are borne by me from the belly which are
carried from the womb  and even to your old age i am he and even
to hoar hairs will i carry you i have made and i will bear even i
will carry and will deliver you
to whom will ye liken me and make me equal and compare me that
we may be like   they lavish gold out of the bag and weigh
silver in the balance and hire a goldsmith and he maketh it a god
they fall down yea they worship
they bear him upon the shoulder they carry him and set him in
his place and he standeth from his place shall he not remove yea
one shall cry unto him yet can he not answer nor save him out of his
trouble
remember this and shew yourselves men bring it again to mind o
ye transgressors
remember the former things of old for i am god and there is
none else i am god and there is none like me  declaring the
end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not
yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my
pleasure  calling a ravenous bird from the east the man that
executeth my counsel from a far country yea i have spoken it i will
also bring it to pass i have purposed it i will also do it
hearken unto me ye stouthearted that are far from
righteousness  i bring near my righteousness it shall not be
far off and my salvation shall not tarry and i will place salvation
in zion for israel my glory
come down and sit in the dust o virgin daughter of babylon sit
on the ground there is no throne o daughter of the chaldeans for
thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate
take the millstones and grind meal uncover thy locks make bare
the leg uncover the thigh pass over the rivers
thy nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen i
will take vengeance and i will not meet thee as a man
as for our redeemer the lord of hosts is his name the holy one
of israel
sit thou silent and get thee into darkness o daughter of the
chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called the lady of kingdoms
i was wroth with my people i have polluted mine inheritance and
given them into thine hand thou didst shew them no mercy upon the
ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke
and thou saidst i shall be a lady for ever so that thou didst
not lay these things to thy heart neither didst remember the latter
end of it
therefore hear now this thou that art given to pleasures that
dwellest carelessly that sayest in thine heart i am and none else
beside me i shall not sit as a widow neither shall i know the loss
of children  but these two things shall come to thee in a moment
in one day the loss of children and widowhood they shall come upon
thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries and for
the great abundance of thine enchantments
for thou hast trusted in thy wickedness thou hast said none
seeth me thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee and
thou hast said in thine heart i am and none else beside me
therefore shall evil come upon thee thou shalt not know from
whence it riseth and mischief shall fall upon thee thou shalt not be
able to put it off and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly
which thou shalt not know
stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy
sorceries wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth if so be thou
shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevail
thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels let now the
astrologers the stargazers the monthly prognosticators stand up
and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee
behold they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them they
shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame there shall
not be a coal to warm at nor fire to sit before it
thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured even
thy merchants from thy youth they shall wander every one to his
quarter none shall save thee
hear ye this o house of jacob which are called by the name of
israel and are come forth out of the waters of judah which swear by
the name of the lord and make mention of the god of israel but not
in truth nor in righteousness
for they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves
upon the god of israel the lord of hosts is his name
i have declared the former things from the beginning and they
went forth out of my mouth and i shewed them i did them suddenly
and they came to pass
because i knew that thou art obstinate and thy neck is an iron
sinew and thy brow brass  i have even from the beginning
declared it to thee before it came to pass i shewed it thee lest
thou shouldest say mine idol hath done them and my graven image and
my molten image hath commanded them
thou hast heard see all this and will not ye declare it i have
shewed thee new things from this time even hidden things and thou
didst not know them
they are created now and not from the beginning even before the
day when thou heardest them not lest thou shouldest say behold i
knew them
yea thou heardest not yea thou knewest not yea from that
time that thine ear was not opened for i knew that thou wouldest deal
very treacherously and wast called a transgressor from the womb
for my names sake will i defer mine anger and for my praise
will i refrain for thee that i cut thee not off
behold i have refined thee but not with silver i have chosen
thee in the furnace of affliction
for mine own sake even for mine own sake will i do it for how
should my name be polluted and i will not give my glory unto another
hearken unto me o jacob and israel my called i am he i am
the first i also am the last
mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth and my
right hand hath spanned the heavens when i call unto them they stand
up together
all ye assemble yourselves and hear which among them hath
declared these things the lord hath loved him he will do his
pleasure on babylon and his arm shall be on the chaldeans
i even i have spoken yea i have called him i have brought
him and he shall make his way prosperous
come ye near unto me hear ye this i have not spoken in secret
from the beginning from the time that it was there am i and now the
lord god and his spirit hath sent me
thus saith the lord thy redeemer the holy one of israel i am
the lord thy god which teacheth thee to profit which leadeth thee by
the way that thou shouldest go
o that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments then had thy
peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea
thy seed also had been as the sand and the offspring of thy
bowels like the gravel thereof his name should not have been cut off
nor destroyed from before me
go ye forth of babylon flee ye from the chaldeans with a voice
of singing declare ye tell this utter it even to the end of the
earth say ye the lord hath redeemed his servant jacob
and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts he
caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them he clave the rock
also and the waters gushed out
there is no peace saith the lord unto the wicked
listen o isles unto me and hearken ye people from far the
lord hath called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother hath
he made mention of my name
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of
his hand hath he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver
hath he hid me  and said unto me thou art my servant o israel
in whom i will be glorified
then i said i have laboured in vain i have spent my strength
for nought and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the lord and
my work with my god
and now saith the lord that formed me from the womb to be his
servant to bring jacob again to him though israel be not gathered
yet shall i be glorious in the eyes of the lord and my god shall be
my strength
and he said it is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the preserved
of israel i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles that
thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth
thus saith the lord the redeemer of israel and his holy one to
him whom man despiseth to him whom the nation abhorreth to a servant
of rulers kings shall see and arise princes also shall worship
because of the lord that is faithful and the holy one of israel and
he shall choose thee
thus saith the lord in an acceptable time have i heard thee and
in a day of salvation have i helped thee and i will preserve thee
and give thee for a covenant of the people to establish the earth to
cause to inherit the desolate heritages  that thou mayest say to
the prisoners go forth to them that are in darkness shew
yourselves they shall feed in the ways and their pastures shall be
in all high places
they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor sun
smite them for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them even by
the springs of water shall he guide them
and i will make all my mountains a way and my highways shall be
exalted
behold these shall come from far and lo these from the north
and from the west and these from the land of sinim
sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into
singing o mountains for the lord hath comforted his people and will
have mercy upon his afflicted
but zion said the lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath
forgotten me
can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have
compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will i
not forget thee
behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls
are continually before me
thy children shall make haste thy destroyers and they that made
thee waste shall go forth of thee
lift up thine eyes round about and behold all these gather
themselves together and come to thee as i live saith the lord thou
shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament and bind
them on thee as a bride doeth
for thy waste and thy desolate places and the land of thy
destruction shall even now be too narrow by reason of the
inhabitants and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away
the children which thou shalt have after thou hast lost the
other shall say again in thine ears the place is too strait for me
give place to me that i may dwell
then shalt thou say in thine heart who hath begotten me these
seeing i have lost my children and am desolate a captive and
removing to and fro and who hath brought up these behold i was left
alone these where had they been   thus saith the lord god
behold i will lift up mine hand to the gentiles and set up my
standard to the people and they shall bring thy sons in their arms
and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders
and kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens thy
nursing mothers they shall bow down to thee with their face toward
the earth and lick up the dust of thy feet and thou shalt know that
i am the lord for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me
shall the prey be taken from the mighty or the lawful captive
delivered   but thus saith the lord even the captives of the
mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be
delivered for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee and
i will save thy children
and i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh and
they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine and
all flesh shall know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer
the mighty one of jacob
thus saith the lord where is the bill of your mothers
divorcement whom i have put away or which of my creditors is it to
whom i have sold you  behold for your iniquities have ye sold
yourselves and for your transgressions is your mother put away
wherefore when i came was there no man when i called was
there none to answer is my hand shortened at all that it cannot
redeem or have i no power to deliver behold at my rebuke i dry up
the sea i make the rivers a wilderness their fish stinketh because
there is no water and dieth for thirst
i clothe the heavens with blackness and i make sackcloth their
covering
the lord god hath given me the tongue of the learned that i
should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary he
wakeneth morning by morning he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the
learned
the lord god hath opened mine ear and i was not rebellious
neither turned away back
i gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked
off the hair i hid not my face from shame and spitting
for the lord god will help me therefore shall i not be
confounded therefore have i set my face like a flint and i know that
i shall not be ashamed
he is near that justifieth me who will contend with me let us
stand together who is mine adversary let him come near to me
behold the lord god will help me who is he that shall condemn
me  lo they all shall wax old as a garment the moth shall eat them
up
who is among you that feareth the lord that obeyeth the voice
of his servant that walketh in darkness and hath no light let him
trust in the name of the lord and stay upon his god
behold all ye that kindle a fire that compass yourselves about
with sparks walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye
have kindled this shall ye have of mine hand ye shall lie down in
sorrow
hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek
the lord look unto the rock whence ye are hewn and to the hole of
the pit whence ye are digged
look unto abraham your father and unto sarah that bare you for
i called him alone and blessed him and increased him
for the lord shall comfort zion he will comfort all her waste
places and he will make her wilderness like eden and her desert like
the garden of the lord joy and gladness shall be found therein
thanksgiving and the voice of melody
hearken unto me my people and give ear unto me o my nation
for a law shall proceed from me and i will make my judgment to rest
for a light of the people
my righteousness is near my salvation is gone forth and mine
arms shall judge the people the isles shall wait upon me and on mine
arm shall they trust
lift up your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth
beneath for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth
shall wax old like a garment and they that dwell therein shall die in
like manner but my salvation shall be for ever and my righteousness
shall not be abolished
hearken unto me ye that know righteousness the people in whose
heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid
of their revilings
for the moth shall eat them up like a garment and the worm shall
eat them like wool but my righteousness shall be for ever and my
salvation from generation to generation
awake awake put on strength o arm of the lord awake as in
the ancient days in the generations of old art thou not it that hath
cut rahab and wounded the dragon   art thou not it which hath
dried the sea the waters of the great deep that hath made the depths
of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over   therefore the
redeemed of the lord shall return and come with singing unto zion
and everlasting joy shall be upon their head they shall obtain
gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away
i even i am he that comforteth you who art thou that thou
shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die and of the son of man
which shall be made as grass  and forgettest the lord thy maker
that hath stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the
earth and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of
the oppressor as if he were ready to destroy and where is the fury
of the oppressor   the captive exile hasteneth that he may be
loosed and that he should not die in the pit nor that his bread
should fail
but i am the lord thy god that divided the sea whose waves
roared the lord of hosts is his name
and i have put my words in thy mouth and i have covered thee in
the shadow of mine hand that i may plant the heavens and lay the
foundations of the earth and say unto zion thou art my people
awake awake stand up o jerusalem which hast drunk at the
hand of the lord the cup of his fury thou hast drunken the dregs of
the cup of trembling and wrung them out
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath
brought forth neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all
the sons that she hath brought up
these two things are come unto thee who shall be sorry for
thee  desolation and destruction and the famine and the sword by
whom shall i comfort thee   thy sons have fainted they lie at
the head of all the streets as a wild bull in a net they are full of
the fury of the lord the rebuke of thy god
therefore hear now this thou afflicted and drunken but not
with wine  thus saith thy lord the lord and thy god that
pleadeth the cause of his people behold i have taken out of thine
hand the cup of trembling even the dregs of the cup of my fury thou
shalt no more drink it again  but i will put it into the hand of
them that afflict thee which have said to thy soul bow down that we
may go over and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the
street to them that went over
awake awake put on thy strength o zion put on thy beautiful
garments o jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no
more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean
shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down o jerusalem
loose thyself from the bands of thy neck o captive daughter of zion
for thus saith the lord ye have sold yourselves for nought and
ye shall be redeemed without money
for thus saith the lord god my people went down aforetime into
egypt to sojourn there and the assyrian oppressed them without cause
now therefore what have i here saith the lord that my people
is taken away for nought they that rule over them make them to howl
saith the lord and my name continually every day is blasphemed
therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know
in that day that i am he that doth speak behold it is i
how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good
tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto zion thy
god reigneth   thy watchmen shall lift up the voice with the
voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when
the lord shall bring again zion
break forth into joy sing together ye waste places of
jerusalem for the lord hath comforted his people he hath redeemed
jerusalem
the lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
nations and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our
god
depart ye depart ye go ye out from thence touch no unclean
thing go ye out of the midst of her be ye clean that bear the
vessels of the lord
for ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight for the
lord will go before you and the god of israel will be your rereward
behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and
extolled and be very high
as many were astonied at thee his visage was so marred more
than any man and his form more than the sons of men  so shall
he sprinkle many nations the kings shall shut their mouths at him
for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which
they had not heard shall they consider
who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord
revealed   for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and
as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and
when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him
he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he
was despised and we esteemed him not
surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we
did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted
but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our
iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his
stripes we are healed
all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to
his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his
mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before
her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth
he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare
his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for
the transgression of my people was he stricken
and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his
death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his
mouth
yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief
when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his
seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall
prosper in his hand
he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied
by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall
bear their iniquities
therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he
shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his
soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he
bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors
sing o barren thou that didst not bear break forth into
singing and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child for
more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married
wife saith the lord
enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the
curtains of thine habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and
strengthen thy stakes  for thou shalt break forth on the right
hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the gentiles and
make the desolate cities to be inhabited
fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou
confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame for thou shalt forget
the shame of thy youth and shalt not remember the reproach of thy
widowhood any more
for thy maker is thine husband the lord of hosts is his name
and thy redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth
shall he be called
for the lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in
spirit and a wife of youth when thou wast refused saith thy god
for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies
will i gather thee
in a little wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment but with
everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee saith the lord thy
redeemer
for this is as the waters of noah unto me for as i have sworn
that the waters of noah should no more go over the earth so have i
sworn that i would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke thee
for the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed but my
kindness shall not depart from thee neither shall the covenant of my
peace be removed saith the lord that hath mercy on thee
o thou afflicted tossed with tempest and not comforted
behold i will lay thy stones with fair colours and lay thy
foundations with sapphires
and i will make thy windows of agates and thy gates of
carbuncles and all thy borders of pleasant stones
and all thy children shall be taught of the lord and great
shall be the peace of thy children
in righteousness shalt thou be established thou shalt be far
from oppression for thou shalt not fear and from terror for it
shall not come near thee
behold they shall surely gather together but not by me
whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake
behold i have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have
created the waster to destroy
no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every
tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn
this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their
righteousness is of me saith the lord
ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that
hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk
without money and without price
wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread and your
labour for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and
eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in
fatness
incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall
live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure
mercies of david
behold i have given him for a witness to the people a leader
and commander to the people
behold thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and
nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the lord thy
god and for the holy one of israel for he hath glorified thee
seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he
is near  let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man
his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy
upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon
for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my
ways saith the lord
for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways
higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and
returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring
forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the
eater  so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it
shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i
please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it
for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the
mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and
all the trees of the field shall clap their hands
instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of
the brier shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the lord
for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off
thus saith the lord keep ye judgment and do justice for my
salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed
blessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that
layeth hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and
keepeth his hand from doing any evil
neither let the son of the stranger that hath joined himself to
the lord speak saying the lord hath utterly separated me from his
people neither let the eunuch say behold i am a dry tree
for thus saith the lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths
and choose the things that please me and take hold of my covenant
even unto them will i give in mine house and within my walls a
place and a name better than of sons and of daughters i will give
them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off
also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the lord
to serve him and to love the name of the lord to be his servants
every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold
of my covenant  even them will i bring to my holy mountain and
make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and
their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for mine house
shall be called an house of prayer for all people
the lord god which gathereth the outcasts of israel saith yet
will i gather others to him beside those that are gathered unto him
all ye beasts of the field come to devour yea all ye beasts in
the forest
his watchmen are blind they are all ignorant they are all dumb
dogs they cannot bark sleeping lying down loving to slumber
yea they are greedy dogs which can never have enough and they
are shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way
every one for his gain from his quarter
come ye say they i will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves
with strong drink and to morrow shall be as this day and much more
abundant
the righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and
merciful men are taken away none considering that the righteous is
taken away from the evil to come
he shall enter into peace they shall rest in their beds each
one walking in his uprightness
but draw near hither ye sons of the sorceress the seed of the
adulterer and the whore
against whom do ye sport yourselves against whom make ye a wide
mouth and draw out the tongue are ye not children of transgression
a seed of falsehood
enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree slaying
the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks   among
the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion they they are thy
lot even to them hast thou poured a drink offering thou hast offered
a meat offering should i receive comfort in these   upon a lofty
and high mountain hast thou set thy bed even thither wentest thou up
to offer sacrifice
behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy
remembrance for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me and
art gone up thou hast enlarged thy bed and made thee a covenant with
them thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it
and thou wentest to the king with ointment and didst increase
thy perfumes and didst send thy messengers far off and didst debase
thyself even unto hell
thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way yet saidst thou
not there is no hope thou hast found the life of thine hand
therefore thou wast not grieved
and of whom hast thou been afraid or feared that thou hast
lied and hast not remembered me nor laid it to thy heart have not i
held my peace even of old and thou fearest me not   i will
declare thy righteousness and thy works for they shall not profit
thee
when thou criest let thy companies deliver thee but the wind
shall carry them all away vanity shall take them but he that putteth
his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy
mountain  and shall say cast ye up cast ye up prepare the
way take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people
for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity
whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also
that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the
humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones
for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth
for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made
for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth and smote him
i hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his
heart
i have seen his ways and will heal him i will lead him also
and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners
i create the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is far
off and to him that is near saith the lord and i will heal him
but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest
whose waters cast up mire and dirt
there is no peace saith my god to the wicked
cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and shew
my people their transgression and the house of jacob their sins
yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation
that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their god
they ask of me the ordinances of justice they take delight in
approaching to god
wherefore have we fasted say they and thou seest not wherefore
have we afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge behold in
the day of your fast ye find pleasure and exact all your labours
behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist
of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice
to be heard on high
is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict
his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread
sackcloth and ashes under him wilt thou call this a fast and an
acceptable day to the lord   is not this the fast that i have
chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens
and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke
is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the
poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that
thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh
then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health
shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before
thee the glory of the lord shall be thy rereward
then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cry
and he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of thee
the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity
and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted
soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as
the noon day  and the lord shall guide thee continually and
satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and thou shalt be
like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail
not
and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places
thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou
shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to
dwell in
if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy
pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of
the lord honourable and shalt honour him not doing thine own ways
nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words
then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord and i will cause thee to
ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the
heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord hath spoken
it
behold the lords hand is not shortened that it cannot save
neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear  but your iniquities
have separated between you and your god and your sins have hid his
face from you that he will not hear
for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with
iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered
perverseness
none calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth they trust
in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth
iniquity
they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spiders web he that
eateth of their eggs dieth and that which is crushed breaketh out
into a viper
their webs shall not become garments neither shall they cover
themselves with their works their works are works of iniquity and
the act of violence is in their hands
their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent
blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and
destruction are in their paths
the way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in their
goings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goeth therein
shall not know peace
therefore is judgment far from us neither doth justice overtake
us we wait for light but behold obscurity for brightness but we
walk in darkness
we grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we had
no eyes we stumble at noon day as in the night we are in desolate
places as dead men
we roar all like bears and mourn sore like doves we look for
judgment but there is none for salvation but it is far off from us
for our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins
testify against us for our transgressions are with us and as for our
iniquities we know them  in transgressing and lying against the
lord and departing away from our god speaking oppression and revolt
conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood
and judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar
off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter
yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh
himself a prey and the lord saw it and it displeased him that there
was no judgment
and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no
intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his
righteousness it sustained him
for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of
salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for
clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak
according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his
adversaries recompence to his enemies to the islands he will repay
recompence
so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his
glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a
flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him
and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn
from transgression in jacob saith the lord
as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my
spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth
shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed
nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed saith the lord from
henceforth and for ever
arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is
risen upon thee
for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross
darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory
shall be seen upon thee
and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the
brightness of thy rising
lift up thine eyes round about and see all they gather
themselves together they come to thee thy sons shall come from far
and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side
then thou shalt see and flow together and thine heart shall
fear and be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be
converted unto thee the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee
the multitude of camels shall cover thee the dromedaries of
midian and ephah all they from sheba shall come they shall bring
gold and incense and they shall shew forth the praises of the lord
all the flocks of kedar shall be gathered together unto thee the
rams of nebaioth shall minister unto thee they shall come up with
acceptance on mine altar and i will glorify the house of my glory
who are these that fly as a cloud and as the doves to their
windows   surely the isles shall wait for me and the ships of
tarshish first to bring thy sons from far their silver and their
gold with them unto the name of the lord thy god and to the holy one
of israel because he hath glorified thee
and the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls and their
kings shall minister unto thee for in my wrath i smote thee but in
my favour have i had mercy on thee
therefore thy gates shall be open continually they shall not be
shut day nor night that men may bring unto thee the forces of the
gentiles and that their kings may be brought
for the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall
perish yea those nations shall be utterly wasted
the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee the fir tree the
pine tree and the box together to beautify the place of my
sanctuary and i will make the place of my feet glorious
the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending
unto thee and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down
at the soles of thy feet and they shall call thee the city of the
lord the zion of the holy one of israel
whereas thou has been forsaken and hated so that no man went
through thee i will make thee an eternal excellency a joy of many
generations
thou shalt also suck the milk of the gentiles and shalt suck
the breast of kings and thou shalt know that i the lord am thy
saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob
for brass i will bring gold and for iron i will bring silver
and for wood brass and for stones iron i will also make thy officers
peace and thine exactors righteousness
violence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting nor
destruction within thy borders but thou shalt call thy walls
salvation and thy gates praise
the sun shall be no more thy light by day neither for
brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but the lord shall be
unto thee an everlasting light and thy god thy glory
thy sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon withdraw
itself for the lord shall be thine everlasting light and the days of
thy mourning shall be ended
thy people also shall be all righteous they shall inherit the
land for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that i
may be glorified
a little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong
nation i the lord will hasten it in his time
the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath
anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to
bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and
the opening of the prison to them that are bound  to proclaim the
acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to
comfort all that mourn  to appoint unto them that mourn in zion
to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the
garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be
called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might
be glorified
and they shall build the old wastes they shall raise up the
former desolations and they shall repair the waste cities the
desolations of many generations
and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks and the sons of
the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers
but ye shall be named the priests of the lord men shall call you
the ministers of our god ye shall eat the riches of the gentiles and
in their glory shall ye boast yourselves
for your shame ye shall have double and for confusion they shall
rejoice in their portion therefore in their land they shall possess
the double everlasting joy shall be unto them
for i the lord love judgment i hate robbery for burnt offering
and i will direct their work in truth and i will make an everlasting
covenant with them
and their seed shall be known among the gentiles and their
offspring among the people all that see them shall acknowledge them
that they are the seed which the lord hath blessed
i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in
my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath
covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decketh
himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her
jewels
for as the earth bringeth forth her bud and as the garden
causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth so the lord
god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the
nations
for zions sake will i not hold my peace and for jerusalems
sake i will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as
brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth
and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy
glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the
lord shall name
thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord and
a royal diadem in the hand of thy god
thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land any
more be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hephzibah and thy
land beulah for the lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be
married
for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry
thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy god
rejoice over thee
i have set watchmen upon thy walls o jerusalem which shall
never hold their peace day nor night ye that make mention of the
lord keep not silence  and give him no rest till he establish
and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth
the lord hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his
strength surely i will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine
enemies and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine for
the which thou hast laboured  but they that have gathered it
shall eat it and praise the lord and they that have brought it
together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness
go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the
people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up a
standard for the people
behold the lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world say
ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his
reward is with him and his work before him
and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the
lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken
who is this that cometh from edom with dyed garments from
bozrah  this that is glorious in his apparel travelling in the
greatness of his strength i that speak in righteousness mighty to
save
wherefore art thou red in thine apparel and thy garments like
him that treadeth in the winefat   i have trodden the winepress
alone and of the people there was none with me for i will tread them
in mine anger and trample them in my fury and their blood shall be
sprinkled upon my garments and i will stain all my raiment
for the day of vengeance is in mine heart and the year of my
redeemed is come
and i looked and there was none to help and i wondered that
there was none to uphold therefore mine own arm brought salvation
unto me and my fury it upheld me
and i will tread down the people in mine anger and make them
drunk in my fury and i will bring down their strength to the earth
i will mention the lovingkindnesses of the lord and the praises
of the lord according to all that the lord hath bestowed on us and
the great goodness toward the house of israel which he hath bestowed
on them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of
his lovingkindnesses
for he said surely they are my people children that will not
lie so he was their saviour
in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his
presence saved them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and
he bare them and carried them all the days of old
but they rebelled and vexed his holy spirit therefore he was
turned to be their enemy and he fought against them
then he remembered the days of old moses and his people
saying where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the
shepherd of his flock where is he that put his holy spirit within
him   that led them by the right hand of moses with his glorious
arm dividing the water before them to make himself an everlasting
name   that led them through the deep as an horse in the
wilderness that they should not stumble   as a beast goeth down
into the valley the spirit of the lord caused him to rest so didst
thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name
look down from heaven and behold from the habitation of thy
holiness and of thy glory where is thy zeal and thy strength the
sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me are they
restrained   doubtless thou art our father though abraham be
ignorant of us and israel acknowledge us not thou o lord art our
father our redeemer thy name is from everlasting
o lord why hast thou made us to err from thy ways and hardened
our heart from thy fear return for thy servants sake the tribes of
thine inheritance
the people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while
our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary
we are thine thou never barest rule over them they were not
called by thy name
oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens that thou wouldest come
down that the mountains might flow down at thy presence  as when
the melting fire burneth the fire causeth the waters to boil to make
thy name known to thine adversaries that the nations may tremble at
thy presence   when thou didst terrible things which we looked
not for thou camest down the mountains flowed down at thy presence
for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor
perceived by the ear neither hath the eye seen o god beside thee
what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him
thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness those
that remember thee in thy ways behold thou art wroth for we have
sinned in those is continuance and we shall be saved
but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses
are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities
like the wind have taken us away
and there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up
himself to take hold of thee for thou hast hid thy face from us and
hast consumed us because of our iniquities
but now o lord thou art our father we are the clay and thou
our potter and we all are the work of thy hand
be not wroth very sore o lord neither remember iniquity for
ever behold see we beseech thee we are all thy people
thy holy cities are a wilderness zion is a wilderness
jerusalem a desolation
our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised
thee is burned up with fire and all our pleasant things are laid
waste
wilt thou refrain thyself for these things o lord wilt thou
hold thy peace and afflict us very sore   i am sought of them
that asked not for me i am found of them that sought me not i said
behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name
i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people
which walketh in a way that was not good after their own thoughts
a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face that
sacrificeth in gardens and burneth incense upon altars of brick
which remain among the graves and lodge in the monuments which eat
swines flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vessels
which say stand by thyself come not near to me for i am holier
than thou these are a smoke in my nose a fire that burneth all the
day
behold it is written before me i will not keep silence but
will recompense even recompense into their bosom  your
iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together saith the
lord which have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemed me
upon the hills therefore will i measure their former work into their
bosom
thus saith the lord as the new wine is found in the cluster and
one saith destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will i do for
my servants sakes that i may not destroy them all
and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob and out of judah an
inheritor of my mountains and mine elect shall inherit it and my
servants shall dwell there
and sharon shall be a fold of flocks and the valley of achor a
place for the herds to lie down in for my people that have sought me
but ye are they that forsake the lord that forget my holy
mountain that prepare a table for that troop and that furnish the
drink offering unto that number
therefore will i number you to the sword and ye shall all bow
down to the slaughter because when i called ye did not answer when
i spake ye did not hear but did evil before mine eyes and did
choose that wherein i delighted not
therefore thus saith the lord god behold my servants shall
eat but ye shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but ye
shall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but ye shall be
ashamed  behold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but ye
shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexation of spirit
and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen for the
lord god shall slay thee and call his servants by another name
that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the
god of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god
of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they
are hid from mine eyes
for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the
former shall not be remembered nor come into mind
but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create for
behold i create jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy
and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people and the
voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of
crying
there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man
that hath not filled his days for the child shall die an hundred
years old but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be
accursed
and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall
plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them
they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant
and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people
and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands
they shall not labour in vain nor bring forth for trouble for
they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with
them
and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer
and while they are yet speaking i will hear
the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall
eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpents meat they
shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord
thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my
footstool where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the
place of my rest   for all those things hath mine hand made and
all those things have been saith the lord but to this man will i
look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth
at my word
he that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man he that sacrificeth
a lamb as if he cut off a dogs neck he that offereth an oblation
as if he offered swines blood he that burneth incense as if he
blessed an idol
yea they have chosen their own ways and their soul delighteth in
their abominations
i also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears
upon them because when i called none did answer when i spake they
did not hear but they did evil before mine eyes and chose that in
which i delighted not
hear the word of the lord ye that tremble at his word your
brethren that hated you that cast you out for my names sake said
let the lord be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and they
shall be ashamed
a voice of noise from the city a voice from the temple a voice
of the lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies
before she travailed she brought forth before her pain came
she was delivered of a man child
who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things shall the
earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at
once  for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children
shall i bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth saith
the lord shall i cause to bring forth and shut the womb saith thy
god
rejoice ye with jerusalem and be glad with her all ye that
love her rejoice for joy with her all ye that mourn for her
that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her
consolations that ye may milk out and be delighted with the
abundance of her glory
for thus saith the lord behold i will extend peace to her like
a river and the glory of the gentiles like a flowing stream then
shall ye suck ye shall be borne upon her sides and be dandled upon
her knees
as one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you and ye
shall be comforted in jerusalem
and when ye see this your heart shall rejoice and your bones
shall flourish like an herb and the hand of the lord shall be known
toward his servants and his indignation toward his enemies
for behold the lord will come with fire and with his chariots
like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with
flames of fire
for by fire and by his sword will the lord plead with all flesh
and the slain of the lord shall be many
they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the
gardens behind one tree in the midst eating swines flesh and the
abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the
lord
for i know their works and their thoughts it shall come that i
will gather all nations and tongues and they shall come and see my
glory
and i will set a sign among them and i will send those that
escape of them unto the nations to tarshish pul and lud that draw
the bow to tubal and javan to the isles afar off that have not
heard my fame neither have seen my glory and they shall declare my
glory among the gentiles
and they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the
lord out of all nations upon horses and in chariots and in litters
and upon mules and upon swift beasts to my holy mountain jerusalem
saith the lord as the children of israel bring an offering in a clean
vessel into the house of the lord
and i will also take of them for priests and for levites saith
the lord
for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make
shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your
name remain
and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another
and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship
before me saith the lord
and they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men
that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die
neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring
unto all flesh
the book of the prophet jeremiah
the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the priests that
were in anathoth in the land of benjamin  to whom the word of the
lord came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah in the
thirteenth year of his reign
it came also in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of
judah unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah
king of judah unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in the
fifth month
then the word of the lord came unto me saying  before i
formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out
of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the
nations
then said i ah lord god behold i cannot speak for i am a
child
but the lord said unto me say not i am a child for thou shalt
go to all that i shall send thee and whatsoever i command thee thou
shalt speak
be not afraid of their faces for i am with thee to deliver thee
saith the lord
then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the
lord said unto me behold i have put my words in thy mouth
see i have this day set thee over the nations and over the
kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throw
down to build and to plant
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying jeremiah
what seest thou and i said i see a rod of an almond tree
then said the lord unto me thou hast well seen for i will
hasten my word to perform it
and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying
what seest thou and i said i see a seething pot and the face
thereof is toward the north
then the lord said unto me out of the north an evil shall break
forth upon all the inhabitants of the land
for lo i will call all the families of the kingdoms of the
north saith the lord and they shall come and they shall set every
one his throne at the entering of the gates of jerusalem and against
all the walls thereof round about and against all the cities of
judah
and i will utter my judgments against them touching all their
wickedness who have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other
gods and worshipped the works of their own hands
thou therefore gird up thy loins and arise and speak unto them
all that i command thee be not dismayed at their faces lest i
confound thee before them
for behold i have made thee this day a defenced city and an
iron pillar and brasen walls against the whole land against the
kings of judah against the princes thereof against the priests
thereof and against the people of the land
and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail
against thee for i am with thee saith the lord to deliver thee
moreover the word of the lord came to me saying  go and cry
in the ears of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord i remember
thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals when
thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown
israel was holiness unto the lord and the firstfruits of his
increase all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon them
saith the lord
hear ye the word of the lord o house of jacob and all the
families of the house of israel  thus saith the lord what
iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from
me and have walked after vanity and are become vain   neither
said they where is the lord that brought us up out of the land of
egypt that led us through the wilderness through a land of deserts
and of pits through a land of drought and of the shadow of death
through a land that no man passed through and where no man dwelt
and i brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit
thereof and the goodness thereof but when ye entered ye defiled my
land and made mine heritage an abomination
the priests said not where is the lord and they that handle the
law knew me not the pastors also transgressed against me and the
prophets prophesied by baal and walked after things that do not
profit
wherefore i will yet plead with you saith the lord and with your
childrens children will i plead
for pass over the isles of chittim and see and send unto kedar
and consider diligently and see if there be such a thing
hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods but my
people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit
be astonished o ye heavens at this and be horribly afraid be
ye very desolate saith the lord
for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the
fountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns broken
cisterns that can hold no water
is israel a servant is he a homeborn slave why is he spoiled
the young lions roared upon him and yelled and they made his
land waste his cities are burned without inhabitant
also the children of noph and tahapanes have broken the crown of
thy head
hast thou not procured this unto thyself in that thou hast
forsaken the lord thy god when he led thee by the way   and now
what hast thou to do in the way of egypt to drink the waters of
sihor or what hast thou to do in the way of assyria to drink the
waters of the river   thine own wickedness shall correct thee
and thy backslidings shall reprove thee know therefore and see that
it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the lord thy
god and that my fear is not in thee saith the lord god of hosts
for of old time i have broken thy yoke and burst thy bands and
thou saidst i will not transgress when upon every high hill and
under every green tree thou wanderest playing the harlot
yet i had planted thee a noble vine wholly a right seed how
then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto
me   for though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much
soap yet thine iniquity is marked before me saith the lord god
how canst thou say i am not polluted i have not gone after
baalim  see thy way in the valley know what thou hast done thou art
a swift dromedary traversing her ways  a wild ass used to the
wilderness that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure in her occasion
who can turn her away all they that seek her will not weary
themselves in her month they shall find her
withhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirst
but thou saidst there is no hope no for i have loved strangers and
after them will i go
as the thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house of
israel ashamed they their kings their princes and their priests
and their prophets
saying to a stock thou art my father and to a stone thou hast
brought me forth for they have turned their back unto me and not
their face but in the time of their trouble they will say arise and
save us
but where are thy gods that thou hast made thee let them arise
if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble for according to the
number of thy cities are thy gods o judah
wherefore will ye plead with me ye all have transgressed against
me saith the lord
in vain have i smitten your children they received no
correction your own sword hath devoured your prophets like a
destroying lion
o generation see ye the word of the lord have i been a
wilderness unto israel a land of darkness wherefore say my people
we are lords we will come no more unto thee   can a maid forget
her ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me
days without number
why trimmest thou thy way to seek love therefore hast thou also
taught the wicked ones thy ways
also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor
innocents i have not found it by secret search but upon all these
yet thou sayest because i am innocent surely his anger shall
turn from me behold i will plead with thee because thou sayest i
have not sinned
why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way thou also shalt
be ashamed of egypt as thou wast ashamed of assyria
yea thou shalt go forth from him and thine hands upon thine
head for the lord hath rejected thy confidences and thou shalt not
prosper in them
they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and
become another mans shall he return unto her again shall not that
land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many
lovers yet return again to me saith the lord
lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see where thou hast
not been lien with in the ways hast thou sat for them as the arabian
in the wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms
and with thy wickedness
therefore the showers have been withholden and there hath been no
latter rain and thou hadst a whores forehead thou refusedst to be
ashamed
wilt thou not from this time cry unto me my father thou art the
guide of my youth   will he reserve his anger for ever will he
keep it to the end  behold thou hast spoken and done evil things as
thou couldest
the lord said also unto me in the days of josiah the king hast
thou seen that which backsliding israel hath done she is gone up upon
every high mountain and under every green tree and there hath played
the harlot
and i said after she had done all these things turn thou unto me
but she returned not and her treacherous sister judah saw it
and i saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding israel
committed adultery i had put her away and given her a bill of
divorce yet her treacherous sister judah feared not but went and
played the harlot also
and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom that
she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with
stocks
and yet for all this her treacherous sister judah hath not turned
unto me with her whole heart but feignedly saith the lord
and the lord said unto me the backsliding israel hath justified
herself more than treacherous judah
go and proclaim these words toward the north and say return
thou backsliding israel saith the lord and i will not cause mine
anger to fall upon you for i am merciful saith the lord and i will
not keep anger for ever
only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed
against the lord thy god and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers
under every green tree and ye have not obeyed my voice saith the
lord
turn o backsliding children saith the lord for i am married
unto you and i will take you one of a city and two of a family and
i will bring you to zion  and i will give you pastors according
to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding
and it shall come to pass when ye be multiplied and increased in
the land in those days saith the lord they shall say no more the
ark of the covenant of the lord neither shall it come to mind
neither shall they remember it neither shall they visit it neither
shall that be done any more
at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord
and all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of the
lord to jerusalem neither shall they walk any more after the
imagination of their evil heart
in those days the house of judah shall walk with the house of
israel and they shall come together out of the land of the north to
the land that i have given for an inheritance unto your fathers
but i said how shall i put thee among the children and give
thee a pleasant land a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations and i
said thou shalt call me my father and shalt not turn away from me
surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband so
have ye dealt treacherously with me o house of israel saith the
lord
a voice was heard upon the high places weeping and supplications
of the children of israel for they have perverted their way and they
have forgotten the lord their god
return ye backsliding children and i will heal your
backslidings
behold we come unto thee for thou art the lord our god
truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills and from the
multitude of mountains truly in the lord our god is the salvation of
israel
for shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth
their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters
we lie down in our shame and our confusion covereth us for we
have sinned against the lord our god we and our fathers from our
youth even unto this day and have not obeyed the voice of the lord
our god
if thou wilt return o israel saith the lord return unto me and
if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight then shalt
thou not remove
and thou shalt swear the lord liveth in truth in judgment and
in righteousness and the nations shall bless themselves in him and
in him shall they glory
for thus saith the lord to the men of judah and jerusalem break
up your fallow ground and sow not among thorns
circumcise yourselves to the lord and take away the foreskins of
your heart ye men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem lest my fury
come forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the
evil of your doings
declare ye in judah and publish in jerusalem and say blow ye
the trumpet in the land cry gather together and say assemble
yourselves and let us go into the defenced cities
set up the standard toward zion retire stay not for i will
bring evil from the north and a great destruction
the lion is come up from his thicket and the destroyer of the
gentiles is on his way he is gone forth from his place to make thy
land desolate and thy cities shall be laid waste without an
inhabitant
for this gird you with sackcloth lament and howl for the fierce
anger of the lord is not turned back from us
and it shall come to pass at that day saith the lord that the
heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes and the
priests shall be astonished and the prophets shall wonder
then said i ah lord god surely thou hast greatly deceived this
people and jerusalem saying ye shall have peace whereas the sword
reacheth unto the soul
at that time shall it be said to this people and to jerusalem a
dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of
my people not to fan nor to cleanse  even a full wind from
those places shall come unto me now also will i give sentence against
them
behold he shall come up as clouds and his chariots shall be as
a whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles woe unto us for we
are spoiled
o jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest
be saved how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
for a voice declareth from dan and publisheth affliction from mount
ephraim
make ye mention to the nations behold publish against
jerusalem that watchers come from a far country and give out their
voice against the cities of judah
as keepers of a field are they against her round about because
she hath been rebellious against me saith the lord
thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee this
is thy wickedness because it is bitter because it reacheth unto
thine heart
my bowels my bowels i am pained at my very heart my heart
maketh a noise in me i cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard
o my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of war
destruction upon destruction is cried for the whole land is
spoiled suddenly are my tents spoiled and my curtains in a moment
how long shall i see the standard and hear the sound of the
trumpet   for my people is foolish they have not known me they
are sottish children and they have none understanding they are wise
to do evil but to do good they have no knowledge
i beheld the earth and lo it was without form and void and
the heavens and they had no light
i beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills
moved lightly
i beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of the
heavens were fled
i beheld and lo the fruitful place was a wilderness and all
the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the lord and
by his fierce anger
for thus hath the lord said the whole land shall be desolate
yet will i not make a full end
for this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be black
because i have spoken it i have purposed it and will not repent
neither will i turn back from it
the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and
bowmen they shall go into thickets and climb up upon the rocks
every city shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein
and when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do though thou
clothest thyself with crimson though thou deckest thee with ornaments
of gold though thou rentest thy face with painting in vain shalt
thou make thyself fair thy lovers will despise thee they will seek
thy life
for i have heard a voice as of a woman in travail and the
anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child the voice of
the daughter of zion that bewaileth herself that spreadeth her
hands saying woe is me now for my soul is wearied because of
murderers
run ye to and fro through the streets of jerusalem and see now
and know and seek in the broad places thereof if ye can find a man
if there be any that executeth judgment that seeketh the truth and i
will pardon it
and though they say the lord liveth surely they swear falsely
o lord are not thine eyes upon the truth thou hast stricken
them but they have not grieved thou hast consumed them but they
have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder
than a rock they have refused to return
therefore i said surely these are poor they are foolish for
they know not the way of the lord nor the judgment of their god
i will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them for
they have known the way of the lord and the judgment of their god
but these have altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds
wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of
the evenings shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over their
cities every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces
because their transgressions are many and their backslidings are
increased
how shall i pardon thee for this thy children have forsaken me
and sworn by them that are no gods when i had fed them to the full
they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in
the harlots houses
they were as fed horses in the morning every one neighed after
his neighbours wife
shall i not visit for these things saith the lord and shall not
my soul be avenged on such a nation as this   go ye up upon her
walls and destroy but make not a full end take away her
battlements for they are not the lords
for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt very
treacherously against me saith the lord
they have belied the lord and said it is not he neither shall
evil come upon us neither shall we see sword nor famine  and the
prophets shall become wind and the word is not in them thus shall it
be done unto them
wherefore thus saith the lord god of hosts because ye speak this
word behold i will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people
wood and it shall devour them
lo i will bring a nation upon you from far o house of israel
saith the lord it is a mighty nation it is an ancient nation a
nation whose language thou knowest not neither understandest what
they say
their quiver is as an open sepulchre they are all mighty men
and they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread which thy
sons and thy daughters should eat they shall eat up thy flocks and
thine herds they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees they shall
impoverish thy fenced cities wherein thou trustedst with the sword
nevertheless in those days saith the lord i will not make a
full end with you
and it shall come to pass when ye shall say wherefore doeth the
lord our god all these things unto us then shalt thou answer them
like as ye have forsaken me and served strange gods in your land so
shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours
declare this in the house of jacob and publish it in judah
saying  hear now this o foolish people and without
understanding which have eyes and see not which have ears and hear
not  fear ye not me saith the lord will ye not tremble at my
presence which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a
perpetual decree that it cannot pass it and though the waves thereof
toss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can
they not pass over it   but this people hath a revolting and a
rebellious heart they are revolted and gone
neither say they in their heart let us now fear the lord our
god that giveth rain both the former and the latter in his season
he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest
your iniquities have turned away these things and your sins have
withholden good things from you
for among my people are found wicked men they lay wait as he
that setteth snares they set a trap they catch men
as a cage is full of birds so are their houses full of deceit
therefore they are become great and waxen rich
they are waxen fat they shine yea they overpass the deeds of
the wicked they judge not the cause the cause of the fatherless yet
they prosper and the right of the needy do they not judge
shall i not visit for these things saith the lord shall not my
soul be avenged on such a nation as this   a wonderful and
horrible thing is committed in the land  the prophets prophesy
falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love
to have it so and what will ye do in the end thereof   o ye
children of benjamin gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of
jerusalem and blow the trumpet in tekoa and set up a sign of fire in
bethhaccerem for evil appeareth out of the north and great
destruction
i have likened the daughter of zion to a comely and delicate
woman
the shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her they shall
pitch their tents against her round about they shall feed every one
in his place
prepare ye war against her arise and let us go up at noon woe
unto us for the day goeth away for the shadows of the evening are
stretched out
arise and let us go by night and let us destroy her palaces
for thus hath the lord of hosts said hew ye down trees and cast
a mount against jerusalem this is the city to be visited she is
wholly oppression in the midst of her
as a fountain casteth out her waters so she casteth out her
wickedness violence and spoil is heard in her before me continually
is grief and wounds
be thou instructed o jerusalem lest my soul depart from thee
lest i make thee desolate a land not inhabited
thus saith the lord of hosts they shall throughly glean the
remnant of israel as a vine turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer
into the baskets
to whom shall i speak and give warning that they may hear
behold their ear is uncircumcised and they cannot hearken behold
the word of the lord is unto them a reproach they have no delight in
it
therefore i am full of the fury of the lord i am weary with
holding in i will pour it out upon the children abroad and upon the
assembly of young men together for even the husband with the wife
shall be taken the aged with him that is full of days
and their houses shall be turned unto others with their fields
and wives together for i will stretch out my hand upon the
inhabitants of the land saith the lord
for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every
one is given to covetousness and from the prophet even unto the
priest every one dealeth falsely
they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people
slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they
were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore they
shall fall among them that fall at the time that i visit them they
shall be cast down saith the lord
thus saith the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for
the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall
find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk therein
also i set watchmen over you saying hearken to the sound of the
trumpet but they said we will not hearken
therefore hear ye nations and know o congregation what is
among them
hear o earth behold i will bring evil upon this people even
the fruit of their thoughts because they have not hearkened unto my
words nor to my law but rejected it
to what purpose cometh there to me incense from sheba and the
sweet cane from a far country your burnt offerings are not
acceptable nor your sacrifices sweet unto me
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will lay stumblingblocks
before this people and the fathers and the sons together shall fall
upon them the neighbour and his friend shall perish
thus saith the lord behold a people cometh from the north
country and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the
earth
they shall lay hold on bow and spear they are cruel and have no
mercy their voice roareth like the sea and they ride upon horses
set in array as men for war against thee o daughter of zion
we have heard the fame thereof our hands wax feeble anguish
hath taken hold of us and pain as of a woman in travail
go not forth into the field nor walk by the way for the sword
of the enemy and fear is on every side
o daughter of my people gird thee with sackcloth and wallow
thyself in ashes make thee mourning as for an only son most bitter
lamentation for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us
i have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people that
thou mayest know and try their way
they are all grievous revolters walking with slanders they are
brass and iron they are all corrupters
the bellows are burned the lead is consumed of the fire the
founder melteth in vain for the wicked are not plucked away
reprobate silver shall men call them because the lord hath
rejected them
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying  stand in
the gate of the lords house and proclaim there this word and say
hear the word of the lord all ye of judah that enter in at these
gates to worship the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel amend your ways
and your doings and i will cause you to dwell in this place
trust ye not in lying words saying the temple of the lord the
temple of the lord the temple of the lord are these
for if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings if ye
throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour  if ye
oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed not
innocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to your
hurt  then will i cause you to dwell in this place in the land
that i gave to your fathers for ever and ever
behold ye trust in lying words that cannot profit
will ye steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and
burn incense unto baal and walk after other gods whom ye know not
and come and stand before me in this house which is called by my
name and say we are delivered to do all these abominations   is
this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in
your eyes behold even i have seen it saith the lord
but go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh where i set my
name at the first and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my
people israel
and now because ye have done all these works saith the lord
and i spake unto you rising up early and speaking but ye heard not
and i called you but ye answered not  therefore will i do unto
this house which is called by my name wherein ye trust and unto the
place which i gave to you and to your fathers as i have done to
shiloh
and i will cast you out of my sight as i have cast out all your
brethren even the whole seed of ephraim
therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor
prayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hear
thee
seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the
streets of jerusalem   the children gather wood and the fathers
kindle the fire and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the
queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that
they may provoke me to anger
do they provoke me to anger saith the lord do they not provoke
themselves to the confusion of their own faces   therefore thus
saith the lord god behold mine anger and my fury shall be poured out
upon this place upon man and upon beast and upon the trees of the
field and upon the fruit of the ground and it shall burn and shall
not be quenched
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel put your burnt
offerings unto your sacrifices and eat flesh
for i spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day
that i brought them out of the land of egypt concerning burnt
offerings or sacrifices  but this thing commanded i them saying
obey my voice and i will be your god and ye shall be my people and
walk ye in all the ways that i have commanded you that it may be well
unto you
but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in the
counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart and went
backward and not forward
since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of
egypt unto this day i have even sent unto you all my servants the
prophets daily rising up early and sending them  yet they
hearkened not unto me nor inclined their ear but hardened their
neck they did worse than their fathers
therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they
will not hearken to thee thou shalt also call unto them but they
will not answer thee
but thou shalt say unto them this is a nation that obeyeth not
the voice of the lord their god nor receiveth correction truth is
perished and is cut off from their mouth
cut off thine hair o jerusalem and cast it away and take up a
lamentation on high places for the lord hath rejected and forsaken
the generation of his wrath
for the children of judah have done evil in my sight saith the
lord they have set their abominations in the house which is called by
my name to pollute it
and they have built the high places of tophet which is in the
valley of the son of hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in
the fire which i commanded them not neither came it into my heart
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall
no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the
valley of slaughter for they shall bury in tophet till there be no
place
and the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of
the heaven and for the beasts of the earth and none shall fray them
away
then will i cause to cease from the cities of judah and from the
streets of jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness
the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the land
shall be desolate
at that time saith the lord they shall bring out the bones of
the kings of judah and the bones of his princes and the bones of the
priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the
inhabitants of jerusalem out of their graves  and they shall
spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven
whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they
have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped
they shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung upon
the face of the earth
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of
them that remain of this evil family which remain in all the places
whither i have driven them saith the lord of hosts
moreover thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord shall they
fall and not arise shall he turn away and not return   why then
is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding
they hold fast deceit they refuse to return
i hearkened and heard but they spake not aright no man repented
him of his wickedness saying what have i done every one turned to
his course as the horse rusheth into the battle
yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times and the
turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming
but my people know not the judgment of the lord
how do ye say we are wise and the law of the lord is with us
lo certainly in vain made he it the pen of the scribes is in vain
the wise men are ashamed they are dismayed and taken lo they
have rejected the word of the lord and what wisdom is in them
therefore will i give their wives unto others and their fields to
them that shall inherit them for every one from the least even unto
the greatest is given to covetousness from the prophet even unto the
priest every one dealeth falsely
for they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people
slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace
were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they
were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore shall
they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they
shall be cast down saith the lord
i will surely consume them saith the lord there shall be no
grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree and the leaf shall fade
and the things that i have given them shall pass away from them
why do we sit still assemble yourselves and let us enter into
the defenced cities and let us be silent there for the lord our god
hath put us to silence and given us water of gall to drink because
we have sinned against the lord
we looked for peace but no good came and for a time of health
and behold trouble   the snorting of his horses was heard from
dan the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his
strong ones for they are come and have devoured the land and all
that is in it the city and those that dwell therein
for behold i will send serpents cockatrices among you which
will not be charmed and they shall bite you saith the lord
when i would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint in
me
behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because
of them that dwell in a far country is not the lord in zion is not
her king in her why have they provoked me to anger with their graven
images and with strange vanities   the harvest is past the
summer is ended and we are not saved
for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt i am black
astonishment hath taken hold on me
is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there why then
is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered   oh that
my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i might
weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people   oh
that i had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men that i
might leave my people and go from them for they be all adulterers
an assembly of treacherous men
and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies but they are
not valiant for the truth upon the earth for they proceed from evil
to evil and they know not me saith the lord
take ye heed every one of his neighbour and trust ye not in any
brother for every brother will utterly supplant and every neighbour
will walk with slanders
and they will deceive every one his neighbour and will not speak
the truth they have taught their tongue to speak lies and weary
themselves to commit iniquity
thine habitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit they
refuse to know me saith the lord
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will melt them
and try them for how shall i do for the daughter of my people
their tongue is as an arrow shot out it speaketh deceit one speaketh
peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth but in heart he layeth his
wait
shall i not visit them for these things saith the lord shall not
my soul be avenged on such a nation as this   for the mountains
will i take up a weeping and wailing and for the habitations of the
wilderness a lamentation because they are burned up so that none can
pass through them neither can men hear the voice of the cattle both
the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled they are gone
and i will make jerusalem heaps and a den of dragons and i will
make the cities of judah desolate without an inhabitant
who is the wise man that may understand this and who is he to
whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken that he may declare it for
what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness that none
passeth through   and the lord saith because they have forsaken
my law which i set before them and have not obeyed my voice neither
walked therein  but have walked after the imagination of their
own heart and after baalim which their fathers taught them
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i
will feed them even this people with wormwood and give them water
of gall to drink
i will scatter them also among the heathen whom neither they nor
their fathers have known and i will send a sword after them till i
have consumed them
thus saith the lord of hosts consider ye and call for the
mourning women that they may come and send for cunning women that
they may come  and let them make haste and take up a wailing for
us that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush out
with waters
for a voice of wailing is heard out of zion how are we spoiled
we are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land because
our dwellings have cast us out
yet hear the word of the lord o ye women and let your ear
receive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and
every one her neighbour lamentation
for death is come up into our windows and is entered into our
palaces to cut off the children from without and the young men from
the streets
speak thus saith the lord even the carcases of men shall fall
as dung upon the open field and as the handful after the harvestman
and none shall gather them
thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom
neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man
glory in his riches  but let him that glorieth glory in this
that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which
exercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth
for in these things i delight saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that i will punish all
them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised  egypt and
judah and edom and the children of ammon and moab and all that are
in the utmost corners that dwell in the wilderness for all these
nations are uncircumcised and all the house of israel are
uncircumcised in the heart
hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you o house of
israel  thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen
and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are
dismayed at them
for the customs of the people are vain for one cutteth a tree
out of the forest the work of the hands of the workman with the axe
they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nails
and with hammers that it move not
they are upright as the palm tree but speak not they must needs
be borne because they cannot go be not afraid of them for they
cannot do evil neither also is it in them to do good
forasmuch as there is none like unto thee o lord thou art
great and thy name is great in might
who would not fear thee o king of nations for to thee doth it
appertain forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations and in
all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee
but they are altogether brutish and foolish the stock is a
doctrine of vanities
silver spread into plates is brought from tarshish and gold from
uphaz the work of the workman and of the hands of the founder blue
and purple is their clothing they are all the work of cunning men
but the lord is the true god he is the living god and an
everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the
nations shall not be able to abide his indignation
thus shall ye say unto them the gods that have not made the
heavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from
under these heavens
he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the
world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by his
discretion
when he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in
the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the
earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out
of his treasures
every man is brutish in his knowledge every founder is
confounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood and
there is no breath in them
they are vanity and the work of errors in the time of their
visitation they shall perish
the portion of jacob is not like them for he is the former of
all things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord of
hosts is his name
gather up thy wares out of the land o inhabitant of the
fortress
for thus saith the lord behold i will sling out the
inhabitants of the land at this once and will distress them that
they may find it so
woe is me for my hurt my wound is grievous but i said truly
this is a grief and i must bear it
my tabernacle is spoiled and all my cords are broken my
children are gone forth of me and they are not there is none to
stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtains
for the pastors are become brutish and have not sought the
lord therefore they shall not prosper and all their flocks shall be
scattered
behold the noise of the bruit is come and a great commotion
out of the north country to make the cities of judah desolate and a
den of dragons
o lord i know that the way of man is not in himself it is not
in man that walketh to direct his steps
o lord correct me but with judgment not in thine anger lest
thou bring me to nothing
pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not and upon
the families that call not on thy name for they have eaten up jacob
and devoured him and consumed him and have made his habitation
desolate
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying  hear ye
the words of this covenant and speak unto the men of judah and to
the inhabitants of jerusalem  and say thou unto them thus saith
the lord god of israel cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words
of this covenant  which i commanded your fathers in the day that
i brought them forth out of the land of egypt from the iron furnace
saying obey my voice and do them according to all which i command
you so shall ye be my people and i will be your god  that i may
perform the oath which i have sworn unto your fathers to give them a
land flowing with milk and honey as it is this day then answered i
and said so be it o lord
then the lord said unto me proclaim all these words in the
cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem saying hear ye the
words of this covenant and do them
for i earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that i
brought them up out of the land of egypt even unto this day rising
early and protesting saying obey my voice
yet they obeyed not nor inclined their ear but walked every one
in the imagination of their evil heart therefore i will bring upon
them all the words of this covenant which i commanded them to do but
they did them not
and the lord said unto me a conspiracy is found among the men of
judah and among the inhabitants of jerusalem
they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers
which refused to hear my words and they went after other gods to
serve them the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my
covenant which i made with their fathers
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon
them which they shall not be able to escape and though they shall
cry unto me i will not hearken unto them
then shall the cities of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem go
and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense but they shall not
save them at all in the time of their trouble
for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods o
judah and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem have ye
set up altars to that shameful thing even altars to burn incense unto
baal
therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up a cry
or prayer for them for i will not hear them in the time that they cry
unto me for their trouble
what hath my beloved to do in mine house seeing she hath
wrought lewdness with many and the holy flesh is passed from thee
when thou doest evil then thou rejoicest
the lord called thy name a green olive tree fair and of
goodly fruit with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire
upon it and the branches of it are broken
for the lord of hosts that planted thee hath pronounced evil
against thee for the evil of the house of israel and of the house of
judah which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger
in offering incense unto baal
and the lord hath given me knowledge of it and i know it then
thou shewedst me their doings
but i was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter
and i knew not that they had devised devices against me saying let
us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof and let us cut him off
from the land of the living that his name may be no more remembered
but o lord of hosts that judgest righteously that triest the
reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee
have i revealed my cause
therefore thus saith the lord of the men of anathoth that seek
thy life saying prophesy not in the name of the lord that thou die
not by our hand  therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold
i will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their sons
and their daughters shall die by famine  and there shall be no
remnant of them for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth even
the year of their visitation
righteous art thou o lord when i plead with thee yet let me
talk with thee of thy judgments wherefore doth the way of the wicked
prosper  wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously
thou hast planted them yea they have taken root they grow
yea they bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and far
from their reins
but thou o lord knowest me thou hast seen me and tried mine
heart toward thee pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and
prepare them for the day of slaughter
how long shall the land mourn and the herbs of every field
wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts are
consumed and the birds because they said he shall not see our last
end
if thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee
then how canst thou contend with horses and if in the land of peace
wherein thou trustedst they wearied thee then how wilt thou do in
the swelling of jordan   for even thy brethren and the house of
thy father even they have dealt treacherously with thee yea they
have called a multitude after thee believe them not though they
speak fair words unto thee
i have forsaken mine house i have left mine heritage i have
given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies
mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest it crieth out
against me therefore have i hated it
mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird the birds round
about are against her come ye assemble all the beasts of the field
come to devour
many pastors have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden my
portion under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desolate
wilderness
they have made it desolate and being desolate it mourneth unto
me the whole land is made desolate because no man layeth it to
heart
the spoilers are come upon all high places through the
wilderness for the sword of the lord shall devour from the one end of
the land even to the other end of the land no flesh shall have peace
they have sown wheat but shall reap thorns they have put
themselves to pain but shall not profit and they shall be ashamed of
your revenues because of the fierce anger of the lord
thus saith the lord against all mine evil neighbours that touch
the inheritance which i have caused my people israel to inherit
behold i will pluck them out of their land and pluck out the house
of judah from among them
and it shall come to pass after that i have plucked them out i
will return and have compassion on them and will bring them again
every man to his heritage and every man to his land
and it shall come to pass if they will diligently learn the
ways of my people to swear by my name the lord liveth as they
taught my people to swear by baal then shall they be built in the
midst of my people
but if they will not obey i will utterly pluck up and destroy
that nation saith the lord
thus saith the lord unto me go and get thee a linen girdle and
put it upon thy loins and put it not in water
so i got a girdle according to the word of the lord and put it
on my loins
and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying
take the girdle that thou hast got which is upon thy loins and
arise go to euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock
so i went and hid it by euphrates as the lord commanded me
and it came to pass after many days that the lord said unto me
arise go to euphrates and take the girdle from thence which i
commanded thee to hide there
then i went to euphrates and digged and took the girdle from
the place where i had hid it and behold the girdle was marred it
was profitable for nothing
then the word of the lord came unto me saying  thus saith
the lord after this manner will i mar the pride of judah and the
great pride of jerusalem
this evil people which refuse to hear my words which walk in
the imagination of their heart and walk after other gods to serve
them and to worship them shall even be as this girdle which is good
for nothing
for as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man so have i
caused to cleave unto me the whole house of israel and the whole house
of judah saith the lord that they might be unto me for a people and
for a name and for a praise and for a glory but they would not
hear
therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word thus saith the
lord god of israel every bottle shall be filled with wine and they
shall say unto thee do we not certainly know that every bottle shall
be filled with wine   then shalt thou say unto them thus saith
the lord behold i will fill all the inhabitants of this land even
the kings that sit upon davids throne and the priests and the
prophets and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with drunkenness
and i will dash them one against another even the fathers and
the sons together saith the lord i will not pity nor spare nor
have mercy but destroy them
hear ye and give ear be not proud for the lord hath spoken
give glory to the lord your god before he cause darkness and
before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains and while ye look
for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross
darkness
but if ye will not hear it my soul shall weep in secret places
for your pride and mine eye shall weep sore and run down with tears
because the lords flock is carried away captive
say unto the king and to the queen humble yourselves sit down
for your principalities shall come down even the crown of your glory
the cities of the south shall be shut up and none shall open
them judah shall be carried away captive all of it it shall be
wholly carried away captive
lift up your eyes and behold them that come from the north
where is the flock that was given thee thy beautiful flock
what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee for thou hast taught
them to be captains and as chief over thee shall not sorrows take
thee as a woman in travail   and if thou say in thine heart
wherefore come these things upon me  for the greatness of thine
iniquity are thy skirts discovered and thy heels made bare
can the ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots
then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil
therefore will i scatter them as the stubble that passeth away
by the wind of the wilderness
this is thy lot the portion of thy measures from me saith the
lord because thou hast forgotten me and trusted in falsehood
therefore will i discover thy skirts upon thy face that thy
shame may appear
i have seen thine adulteries and thy neighings the lewdness of
thy whoredom and thine abominations on the hills in the fields woe
unto thee o jerusalem wilt thou not be made clean when shall it
once be   the word of the lord that came to jeremiah concerning
the dearth
judah mourneth and the gates thereof languish they are black
unto the ground and the cry of jerusalem is gone up
and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters they
came to the pits and found no water they returned with their vessels
empty they were ashamed and confounded and covered their heads
because the ground is chapt for there was no rain in the earth
the plowmen were ashamed they covered their heads
yea the hind also calved in the field and forsook it because
there was no grass
and the wild asses did stand in the high places they snuffed up
the wind like dragons their eyes did fail because there was no
grass
o lord though our iniquities testify against us do thou it for
thy names sake for our backslidings are many we have sinned against
thee
o the hope of israel the saviour thereof in time of trouble why
shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfaring man
that turneth aside to tarry for a night   why shouldest thou be
as a man astonied as a mighty man that cannot save yet thou o lord
art in the midst of us and we are called by thy name leave us not
thus saith the lord unto this people thus have they loved to
wander they have not refrained their feet therefore the lord doth
not accept them he will now remember their iniquity and visit their
sins
then said the lord unto me pray not for this people for their
good
when they fast i will not hear their cry and when they offer
burnt offering and an oblation i will not accept them but i will
consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence
then said i ah lord god behold the prophets say unto them
ye shall not see the sword neither shall ye have famine but i will
give you assured peace in this place
then the lord said unto me the prophets prophesy lies in my
name i sent them not neither have i commanded them neither spake
unto them they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination and a
thing of nought and the deceit of their heart
therefore thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that
prophesy in my name and i sent them not yet they say sword and
famine shall not be in this land by sword and famine shall those
prophets be consumed
and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the
streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and they
shall have none to bury them them their wives nor their sons nor
their daughters for i will pour their wickedness upon them
therefore thou shalt say this word unto them let mine eyes run
down with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgin
daughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a very
grievous blow
if i go forth into the field then behold the slain with the
sword  and if i enter into the city then behold them that are sick
with famine  yea both the prophet and the priest go about into a
land that they know not
hast thou utterly rejected judah hath thy soul lothed zion why
hast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us we looked for
peace and there is no good and for the time of healing and behold
trouble   we acknowledge o lord our wickedness and the
iniquity of our fathers for we have sinned against thee
do not abhor us for thy names sake do not disgrace the throne
of thy glory remember break not thy covenant with us
are there any among the vanities of the gentiles that can cause
rain or can the heavens give showers art not thou he o lord our
god  therefore we will wait upon thee for thou hast made all these
things
then said the lord unto me though moses and samuel stood before
me yet my mind could not be toward this people cast them out of my
sight and let them go forth
and it shall come to pass if they say unto thee whither shall
we go forth then thou shalt tell them thus saith the lord such as
are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword
and such as are for the famine to the famine and such as are for the
captivity to the captivity
and i will appoint over them four kinds saith the lord the
sword to slay and the dogs to tear and the fowls of the heaven and
the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy
and i will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the
earth because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah for that
which he did in jerusalem
for who shall have pity upon thee o jerusalem or who shall
bemoan thee or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest   thou
hast forsaken me saith the lord thou art gone backward therefore
will i stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee i am weary
with repenting
and i will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land i will
bereave them of children i will destroy my people since they return
not from their ways
their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas i
have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler
at noonday i have caused him to fall upon it suddenly and terrors
upon the city
she that hath borne seven languisheth she hath given up the
ghost her sun is gone down while it was yet day she hath been
ashamed and confounded and the residue of them will i deliver to the
sword before their enemies saith the lord
woe is me my mother that thou hast borne me a man of strife
and a man of contention to the whole earth i have neither lent on
usury nor men have lent to me on usury yet every one of them doth
curse me
the lord said verily it shall be well with thy remnant verily
i will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in
the time of affliction
shall iron break the northern iron and the steel   thy
substance and thy treasures will i give to the spoil without price
and that for all thy sins even in all thy borders
and i will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land
which thou knowest not for a fire is kindled in mine anger which
shall burn upon you
o lord thou knowest remember me and visit me and revenge me
of my persecutors take me not away in thy longsuffering know that
for thy sake i have suffered rebuke
thy words were found and i did eat them and thy word was unto
me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart for i am called by thy name o
lord god of hosts
i sat not in the assembly of the mockers nor rejoiced i sat
alone because of thy hand for thou hast filled me with indignation
why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable which refuseth
to be healed wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar and as waters
that fail   therefore thus saith the lord if thou return then
will i bring thee again and thou shalt stand before me and if thou
take forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth let
them return unto thee but return not thou unto them
and i will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall and
they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against
thee for i am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith the
lord
and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and i
will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible
the word of the lord came also unto me saying  thou shalt
not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in
this place
for thus saith the lord concerning the sons and concerning the
daughters that are born in this place and concerning their mothers
that bare them and concerning their fathers that begat them in this
land  they shall die of grievous deaths they shall not be
lamented neither shall they be buried but they shall be as dung upon
the face of the earth and they shall be consumed by the sword and by
famine and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven and
for the beasts of the earth
for thus saith the lord enter not into the house of mourning
neither go to lament nor bemoan them for i have taken away my peace
from this people saith the lord even lovingkindness and mercies
both the great and the small shall die in this land they shall
not be buried neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselves
nor make themselves bald for them  neither shall men tear
themselves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead neither
shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father
or for their mother
thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting to sit with
them to eat and to drink
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i
will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your days
the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the
bridegroom and the voice of the bride
and it shall come to pass when thou shalt shew this people all
these words and they shall say unto thee wherefore hath the lord
pronounced all this great evil against us or what is our iniquity or
what is our sin that we have committed against the lord our god
then shalt thou say unto them because your fathers have
forsaken me saith the lord and have walked after other gods and
have served them and have worshipped them and have forsaken me and
have not kept my law  and ye have done worse than your fathers
for behold ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil
heart that they may not hearken unto me  therefore will i cast
you out of this land into a land that ye know not neither ye nor your
fathers and there shall ye serve other gods day and night where i
will not shew you favour
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall
no more be said the lord liveth that brought up the children of
israel out of the land of egypt  but the lord liveth that
brought up the children of israel from the land of the north and from
all the lands whither he had driven them and i will bring them again
into their land that i gave unto their fathers
behold i will send for many fishers saith the lord and they
shall fish them and after will i send for many hunters and they
shall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of
the holes of the rocks
for mine eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from my
face neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes
and first i will recompense their iniquity and their sin double
because they have defiled my land they have filled mine inheritance
with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things
o lord my strength and my fortress and my refuge in the day
of affliction the gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the
earth and shall say surely our fathers have inherited lies vanity
and things wherein there is no profit
shall a man make gods unto himself and they are no gods
therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will cause
them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name
is the lord
the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron and with the
point of a diamond it is graven upon the table of their heart and
upon the horns of your altars  whilst their children remember
their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills
o my mountain in the field i will give thy substance and all thy
treasures to the spoil and thy high places for sin throughout all
thy borders
and thou even thyself shalt discontinue from thine heritage
that i gave thee and i will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the
land which thou knowest not for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger
which shall burn for ever
thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and
maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord
for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see
when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the
wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited
blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope the
lord is
for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that
spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when heat
cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the
year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit
the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked
who can know it   i the lord search the heart i try the reins
even to give every man according to his ways and according to the
fruit of his doings
as the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not so he
that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst
of his days and at his end shall be a fool
a glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our
sanctuary
o lord the hope of israel all that forsake thee shall be
ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth
because they have forsaken the lord the fountain of living waters
heal me o lord and i shall be healed save me and i shall be
saved for thou art my praise
behold they say unto me where is the word of the lord let it
come now
as for me i have not hastened from being a pastor to follow
thee neither have i desired the woeful day thou knowest that which
came out of my lips was right before thee
be not a terror unto me thou art my hope in the day of evil
let them be confounded that persecute me but let not me be
confounded let them be dismayed but let not me be dismayed bring
upon them the day of evil and destroy them with double destruction
thus said the lord unto me go and stand in the gate of the
children of the people whereby the kings of judah come in and by the
which they go out and in all the gates of jerusalem  and say
unto them hear ye the word of the lord ye kings of judah and all
judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem that enter in by these
gates  thus saith the lord take heed to yourselves and bear no
burden on the sabbath day nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem
neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath
day neither do ye any work but hallow ye the sabbath day as i
commanded your fathers
but they obeyed not neither inclined their ear but made their
neck stiff that they might not hear nor receive instruction
and it shall come to pass if ye diligently hearken unto me
saith the lord to bring in no burden through the gates of this city
on the sabbath day but hallow the sabbath day to do no work therein
then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and
princes sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on
horses they and their princes the men of judah and the inhabitants
of jerusalem and this city shall remain for ever
and they shall come from the cities of judah and from the
places about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from the
plain and from the mountains and from the south bringing burnt
offerings and sacrifices and meat offerings and incense and
bringing sacrifices of praise unto the house of the lord
but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day
and not to bear a burden even entering in at the gates of jerusalem
on the sabbath day then will i kindle a fire in the gates thereof
and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem and it shall not be
quenched
the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying
arise and go down to the potters house and there i will cause thee
to hear my words
then i went down to the potters house and behold he wrought a
work on the wheels
and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the
potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the
potter to make it
then the word of the lord came to me saying  o house of
israel cannot i do with you as this potter saith the lord behold
as the clay is in the potters hand so are ye in mine hand o house
of israel
at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning
a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it  if
that nation against whom i have pronounced turn from their evil i
will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them
and at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and
concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it  if it do evil in
my sight that it obey not my voice then i will repent of the good
wherewith i said i would benefit them
now therefore go to speak to the men of judah and to the
inhabitants of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord behold i frame
evil against you and devise a device against you return ye now every
one from his evil way and make your ways and your doings good
and they said there is no hope but we will walk after our own
devices and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart
therefore thus saith the lord ask ye now among the heathen who
hath heard such things the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible
thing
will a man leave the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rock
of the field or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another
place be forsaken   because my people hath forgotten me they
have burned incense to vanity and they have caused them to stumble in
their ways from the ancient paths to walk in paths in a way not cast
up  to make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing every
one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and wag his head
i will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy i
will shew them the back and not the face in the day of their
calamity
then said they come and let us devise devices against jeremiah
for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the
wise nor the word from the prophet come and let us smite him with
the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words
give heed to me o lord and hearken to the voice of them that
contend with me
shall evil be recompensed for good for they have digged a pit
for my soul remember that i stood before thee to speak good for them
and to turn away thy wrath from them
therefore deliver up their children to the famine and pour out
their blood by the force of the sword and let their wives be bereaved
of their children and be widows and let their men be put to death
let their young men be slain by the sword in battle
let a cry be heard from their houses when thou shalt bring a
troop suddenly upon them for they have digged a pit to take me and
hid snares for my feet
yet lord thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me
forgive not their iniquity neither blot out their sin from thy sight
but let them be overthrown before thee deal thus with them in the
time of thine anger
thus saith the lord go and get a potters earthen bottle and
take of the ancients of the people and of the ancients of the
priests  and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom which
is by the entry of the east gate and proclaim there the words that i
shall tell thee  and say hear ye the word of the lord o kings
of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem thus saith the lord of hosts
the god of israel behold i will bring evil upon this place the
which whosoever heareth his ears shall tingle
because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and
have burned incense in it unto other gods whom neither they nor their
fathers have known nor the kings of judah and have filled this place
with the blood of innocents  they have built also the high places
of baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto baal
which i commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mind
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that this place
shall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom
but the valley of slaughter
and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this
place and i will cause them to fall by the sword before their
enemies and by the hands of them that seek their lives and their
carcases will i give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for
the beasts of the earth
and i will make this city desolate and an hissing every one
that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the
plagues thereof
and i will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the
flesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh of
his friend in the siege and straitness wherewith their enemies and
they that seek their lives shall straiten them
then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go
with thee  and shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of
hosts even so will i break this people and this city as one breaketh
a potters vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shall
bury them in tophet till there be no place to bury
thus will i do unto this place saith the lord and to the
inhabitants thereof and even make this city as tophet  and the
houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah shall be
defiled as the place of tophet because of all the houses upon whose
roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven and have
poured out drink offerings unto other gods
then came jeremiah from tophet whither the lord had sent him to
prophesy and he stood in the court of the lords house and said to
all the people  thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel
behold i will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the
evil that i have pronounced against it because they have hardened
their necks that they might not hear my words
now pashur the son of immer the priest who was also chief
governor in the house of the lord heard that jeremiah prophesied
these things
then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks
that were in the high gate of benjamin which was by the house of the
lord
and it came to pass on the morrow that pashur brought forth
jeremiah out of the stocks then said jeremiah unto him the lord hath
not called thy name pashur but magormissabib
for thus saith the lord behold i will make thee a terror to
thyself and to all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword of
their enemies and thine eyes shall behold it and i will give all
judah into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall carry them
captive into babylon and shall slay them with the sword
moreover i will deliver all the strength of this city and all
the labours thereof and all the precious things thereof and all the
treasures of the kings of judah will i give into the hand of their
enemies which shall spoil them and take them and carry them to
babylon
and thou pashur and all that dwell in thine house shall go into
captivity and thou shalt come to babylon and there thou shalt die
and shalt be buried there thou and all thy friends to whom thou
hast prophesied lies
o lord thou hast deceived me and i was deceived thou art
stronger than i and hast prevailed i am in derision daily every one
mocketh me
for since i spake i cried out i cried violence and spoil
because the word of the lord was made a reproach unto me and a
derision daily
then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak any more
in his name but his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up
in my bones and i was weary with forbearing and i could not stay
for i heard the defaming of many fear on every side report
say they and we will report it all my familiars watched for my
halting saying peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail
against him and we shall take our revenge on him
but the lord is with me as a mighty terrible one therefore my
persecutors shall stumble and they shall not prevail they shall be
greatly ashamed for they shall not prosper their everlasting
confusion shall never be forgotten
but o lord of hosts that triest the righteous and seest the
reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee
have i opened my cause
sing unto the lord praise ye the lord for he hath delivered
the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers
cursed be the day wherein i was born let not the day wherein my
mother bare me be blessed
cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father saying a
man child is born unto thee making him very glad
and let that man be as the cities which the lord overthrew and
repented not and let him hear the cry in the morning and the
shouting at noontide  because he slew me not from the womb or
that my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be always
great with me
wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow
that my days should be consumed with shame   the word which came
unto jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent unto him pashur
the son of melchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest
saying  enquire i pray thee of the lord for us for
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against us if so be that
the lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works that
he may go up from us
then said jeremiah unto them thus shall ye say to zedekiah
thus saith the lord god of israel behold i will turn back the
weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against the
king of babylon and against the chaldeans which besiege you without
the walls and i will assemble them into the midst of this city
and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and
with a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath
and i will smite the inhabitants of this city both man and
beast they shall die of a great pestilence
and afterward saith the lord i will deliver zedekiah king of
judah and his servants and the people and such as are left in this
city from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine into
the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their
enemies and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall
smite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare them
neither have pity nor have mercy
and unto this people thou shalt say thus saith the lord behold
i set before you the way of life and the way of death
he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the
famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and falleth to
the chaldeans that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be
unto him for a prey
for i have set my face against this city for evil and not for
good saith the lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of
babylon and he shall burn it with fire
and touching the house of the king of judah say hear ye the
word of the lord  o house of david thus saith the lord execute
judgment in the morning and deliver him that is spoiled out of the
hand of the oppressor lest my fury go out like fire and burn that
none can quench it because of the evil of your doings
behold i am against thee o inhabitant of the valley and rock
of the plain saith the lord which say who shall come down against
us or who shall enter into our habitations   but i will punish
you according to the fruit of your doings saith the lord and i will
kindle a fire in the forest thereof and it shall devour all things
round about it
thus saith the lord go down to the house of the king of judah
and speak there this word  and say hear the word of the lord o
king of judah that sittest upon the throne of david thou and thy
servants and thy people that enter in by these gates  thus saith
the lord execute ye judgment and righteousness and deliver the
spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong do no
violence to the stranger the fatherless nor the widow neither shed
innocent blood in this place
for if ye do this thing indeed then shall there enter in by the
gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of david riding in
chariots and on horses he and his servants and his people
but if ye will not hear these words i swear by myself saith the
lord that this house shall become a desolation
for thus saith the lord unto the kings house of judah thou art
gilead unto me and the head of lebanon yet surely i will make thee a
wilderness and cities which are not inhabited
and i will prepare destroyers against thee every one with his
weapons and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and cast them into
the fire
and many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say
every man to his neighbour wherefore hath the lord done thus unto
this great city   then they shall answer because they have
forsaken the covenant of the lord their god and worshipped other
gods and served them
weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore for
him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his native
country
for thus saith the lord touching shallum the son of josiah king
of judah which reigned instead of josiah his father which went forth
out of this place he shall not return thither any more  but he
shall die in the place whither they have led him captive and shall
see this land no more
woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his
chambers by wrong that useth his neighbours service without wages
and giveth him not for his work  that saith i will build me a
wide house and large chambers and cutteth him out windows and it is
cieled with cedar and painted with vermilion
shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar did not
thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and then it was
well with him   he judged the cause of the poor and needy then
it was well with him was not this to know me saith the lord
but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness
and for to shed innocent blood and for oppression and for violence
to do it
therefore thus saith the lord concerning jehoiakim the son of
josiah king of judah they shall not lament for him saying ah my
brother or ah sister they shall not lament for him saying ah
lord or ah his glory   he shall be buried with the burial of
an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem
go up to lebanon and cry and lift up thy voice in bashan and
cry from the passages for all thy lovers are destroyed
i spake unto thee in thy prosperity but thou saidst i will not
hear this hath been thy manner from thy youth that thou obeyedst not
my voice
the wind shall eat up all thy pastors and thy lovers shall go
into captivity surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for
all thy wickedness
o inhabitant of lebanon that makest thy nest in the cedars how
gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee the pain as of a
woman in travail   as i live saith the lord though coniah the
son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet
would i pluck thee thence  and i will give thee into the hand of
them that seek thy life and into the hand of them whose face thou
fearest even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and
into the hand of the chaldeans
and i will cast thee out and thy mother that bare thee into
another country where ye were not born and there shall ye die
but to the land whereunto they desire to return thither shall
they not return
is this man coniah a despised broken idol is he a vessel
wherein is no pleasure wherefore are they cast out he and his seed
and are cast into a land which they know not   o earth earth
earth hear the word of the lord
thus saith the lord write ye this man childless a man that
shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper
sitting upon the throne of david and ruling any more in judah
woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my
pasture saith the lord
therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastors
that feed my people ye have scattered my flock and driven them away
and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of
your doings saith the lord
and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries
whither i have driven them and will bring them again to their folds
and they shall be fruitful and increase
and i will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them and
they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be
lacking saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto
david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and
shall execute judgment and justice in the earth
in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely
and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our
righteousness
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that they shall
no more say the lord liveth which brought up the children of israel
out of the land of egypt  but the lord liveth which brought up
and which led the seed of the house of israel out of the north
country and from all countries whither i had driven them and they
shall dwell in their own land
mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets all my
bones shake i am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hath
overcome because of the lord and because of the words of his
holiness
for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the
land mourneth the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up and
their course is evil and their force is not right
for both prophet and priest are profane yea in my house have i
found their wickedness saith the lord
wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the
darkness they shall be driven on and fall therein for i will bring
evil upon them even the year of their visitation saith the lord
and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria they
prophesied in baal and caused my people israel to err
i have seen also in the prophets of jerusalem an horrible thing
they commit adultery and walk in lies they strengthen also the hands
of evildoers that none doth return from his wickedness they are all
of them unto me as sodom and the inhabitants thereof as gomorrah
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the prophets
behold i will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the water
of gall for from the prophets of jerusalem is profaneness gone forth
into all the land
thus saith the lord of hosts hearken not unto the words of the
prophets that prophesy unto you they make you vain they speak a
vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord
they say still unto them that despise me the lord hath said ye
shall have peace and they say unto every one that walketh after the
imagination of his own heart no evil shall come upon you
for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord and hath
perceived and heard his word who hath marked his word and heard it
behold a whirlwind of the lord is gone forth in fury even a
grievous whirlwind it shall fall grievously upon the head of the
wicked
the anger of the lord shall not return until he have executed
and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart in the latter
days ye shall consider it perfectly
i have not sent these prophets yet they ran i have not spoken
to them yet they prophesied
but if they had stood in my counsel and had caused my people to
hear my words then they should have turned them from their evil way
and from the evil of their doings
am i a god at hand saith the lord and not a god afar off
can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see him
saith the lord do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord
i have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in my
name saying i have dreamed i have dreamed
how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that
prophesy lies yea they are prophets of the deceit of their own
heart  which think to cause my people to forget my name by their
dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathers
have forgotten my name for baal
the prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that
hath my word let him speak my word faithfully what is the chaff to
the wheat saith the lord
is not my word like as a fire saith the lord and like a hammer
that breaketh the rock in pieces   therefore behold i am
against the prophets saith the lord that steal my words every one
from his neighbour
behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that use
their tongues and say he saith
behold i am against them that prophesy false dreams saith the
lord and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and
by their lightness yet i sent them not nor commanded them therefore
they shall not profit this people at all saith the lord
and when this people or the prophet or a priest shall ask
thee saying what is the burden of the lord thou shalt then say unto
them what burden i will even forsake you saith the lord
and as for the prophet and the priest and the people that
shall say the burden of the lord i will even punish that man and his
house
thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour and every one to
his brother what hath the lord answered and what hath the lord
spoken   and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more
for every mans word shall be his burden for ye have perverted the
words of the living god of the lord of hosts our god
thus shalt thou say to the prophet what hath the lord answered
thee and what hath the lord spoken   but since ye say the
burden of the lord therefore thus saith the lord because ye say this
word the burden of the lord and i have sent unto you saying ye
shall not say the burden of the lord  therefore behold i
even i will utterly forget you and i will forsake you and the city
that i gave you and your fathers and cast you out of my presence
and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a
perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten
the lord shewed me and behold two baskets of figs were set
before the temple of the lord after that nebuchadrezzar king of
babylon had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of
judah and the princes of judah with the carpenters and smiths from
jerusalem and had brought them to babylon
one basket had very good figs even like the figs that are first
ripe and the other basket had very naughty figs which could not be
eaten they were so bad
then said the lord unto me what seest thou jeremiah and i
said figs the good figs very good and the evil very evil that
cannot be eaten they are so evil
again the word of the lord came unto me saying  thus saith
the lord the god of israel like these good figs so will i
acknowledge them that are carried away captive of judah whom i have
sent out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for their good
for i will set mine eyes upon them for good and i will bring
them again to this land and i will build them and not pull them
down and i will plant them and not pluck them up
and i will give them an heart to know me that i am the lord and
they shall be my people and i will be their god for they shall
return unto me with their whole heart
and as the evil figs which cannot be eaten they are so evil
surely thus saith the lord so will i give zedekiah the king of judah
and his princes and the residue of jerusalem that remain in this
land and them that dwell in the land of egypt  and i will
deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for
their hurt to be a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curse in
all places whither i shall drive them
and i will send the sword the famine and the pestilence among
them till they be consumed from off the land that i gave unto them
and to their fathers
the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah
in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that
was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon  the which
jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah and to all
the inhabitants of jerusalem saying  from the thirteenth year of
josiah the son of amon king of judah even unto this day that is the
three and twentieth year the word of the lord hath come unto me and
i have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye have not
hearkened
and the lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets
rising early and sending them but ye have not hearkened nor inclined
your ear to hear
they said turn ye again now every one from his evil way and
from the evil of your doings and dwell in the land that the lord hath
given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever  and go not
after other gods to serve them and to worship them and provoke me
not to anger with the works of your hands and i will do you no hurt
yet ye have not hearkened unto me saith the lord that ye might
provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts because ye have not heard
my words  behold i will send and take all the families of the
north saith the lord and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my
servant and will bring them against this land and against the
inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and
will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and an
hissing and perpetual desolations
moreover i will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice
of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride
the sound of the millstones and the light of the candle
and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment
and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years
and it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished
that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith the
lord for their iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and will make
it perpetual desolations
and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have
pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which
jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations
for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them
also and i will recompense them according to their deeds and
according to the works of their own hands
for thus saith the lord god of israel unto me take the wine cup
of this fury at my hand and cause all the nations to whom i send
thee to drink it
and they shall drink and be moved and be mad because of the
sword that i will send among them
then took i the cup at the lords hand and made all the nations
to drink unto whom the lord had sent me  to wit jerusalem and
the cities of judah and the kings thereof and the princes thereof
to make them a desolation an astonishment an hissing and a curse
as it is this day  pharaoh king of egypt and his servants and
his princes and all his people  and all the mingled people and
all the kings of the land of uz and all the kings of the land of the
philistines and ashkelon and azzah and ekron and the remnant of
ashdod  edom and moab and the children of ammon  and all
the kings of tyrus and all the kings of zidon and the kings of the
isles which are beyond the sea  dedan and tema and buz and
all that are in the utmost corners  and all the kings of arabia
and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert
and all the kings of zimri and all the kings of elam and all
the kings of the medes  and all the kings of the north far and
near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world which are
upon the face of the earth and the king of sheshach shall drink after
them
therefore thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of
hosts the god of israel drink ye and be drunken and spue and
fall and rise no more because of the sword which i will send among
you
and it shall be if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to
drink then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts ye
shall certainly drink
for lo i begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my
name and should ye be utterly unpunished ye shall not be unpunished
for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth
saith the lord of hosts
therefore prophesy thou against them all these words and say
unto them the lord shall roar from on high and utter his voice from
his holy habitation he shall mightily roar upon his habitation he
shall give a shout as they that tread the grapes against all the
inhabitants of the earth
a noise shall come even to the ends of the earth for the lord
hath a controversy with the nations he will plead with all flesh he
will give them that are wicked to the sword saith the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts behold evil shall go forth from
nation to nation and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the
coasts of the earth
and the slain of the lord shall be at that day from one end of
the earth even unto the other end of the earth they shall not be
lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung upon the
ground
howl ye shepherds and cry and wallow yourselves in the ashes
ye principal of the flock for the days of your slaughter and of your
dispersions are accomplished and ye shall fall like a pleasant
vessel
and the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the principal
of the flock to escape
a voice of the cry of the shepherds and an howling of the
principal of the flock shall be heard for the lord hath spoiled
their pasture
and the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce
anger of the lord
he hath forsaken his covert as the lion for their land is
desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because of
his fierce anger
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king
of judah came this word from the lord saying  thus saith the
lord stand in the court of the lords house and speak unto all the
cities of judah which come to worship in the lords house all the
words that i command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word
if so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way
that i may repent me of the evil which i purpose to do unto them
because of the evil of their doings
and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord if ye will not
hearken to me to walk in my law which i have set before you  to
hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom i sent unto
you both rising up early and sending them but ye have not
hearkened  then will i make this house like shiloh and will make
this city a curse to all the nations of the earth
so the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah
speaking these words in the house of the lord
now it came to pass when jeremiah had made an end of speaking
all that the lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people that
the priests and the prophets and all the people took him saying thou
shalt surely die
why hast thou prophesied in the name of the lord saying this
house shall be like shiloh and this city shall be desolate without an
inhabitant  and all the people were gathered against jeremiah in the
house of the lord
when the princes of judah heard these things then they came up
from the kings house unto the house of the lord and sat down in the
entry of the new gate of the lords house
then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to
all the people saying this man is worthy to die for he hath
prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears
then spake jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people
saying the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against
this city all the words that ye have heard
therefore now amend your ways and your doings and obey the
voice of the lord your god and the lord will repent him of the evil
that he hath pronounced against you
as for me behold i am in your hand do with me as seemeth good
and meet unto you
but know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shall
surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and
upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the lord hath sent me
unto you to speak all these words in your ears
then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to
the prophets this man is not worthy to die for he hath spoken to us
in the name of the lord our god
then rose up certain of the elders of the land and spake to all
the assembly of the people saying  micah the morasthite
prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah and spake to all the
people of judah saying thus saith the lord of hosts zion shall be
plowed like a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the
mountain of the house as the high places of a forest
did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to
death  did he not fear the lord and besought the lord and the lord
repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them thus
might we procure great evil against our souls
and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the
lord urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim who prophesied
against this city and against this land according to all the words of
jeremiah
and when jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and all
the princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death but
when urijah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into egypt
and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt namely elnathan the
son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt
and they fetched forth urijah out of egypt and brought him unto
jehoiakim the king who slew him with the sword and cast his dead
body into the graves of the common people
nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with
jeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the people to
put him to death
in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king
of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord saying  thus
saith the lord to me make thee bonds and yokes and put them upon thy
neck  and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab
and to the king of the ammonites and to the king of tyrus and to the
king of zidon by the hand of the messengers which come to jerusalem
unto zedekiah king of judah  and command them to say unto their
masters thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel thus shall
ye say unto your masters  i have made the earth the man and the
beast that are upon the ground by my great power and by my
outstretched arm and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me
and now have i given all these lands into the hand of
nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and the beasts of the
field have i given him also to serve him
and all nations shall serve him and his son and his sons son
until the very time of his land come and then many nations and great
kings shall serve themselves of him
and it shall come to pass that the nation and kingdom which will
not serve the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and that will
not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nation
will i punish saith the lord with the sword and with the famine
and with the pestilence until i have consumed them by his hand
therefore hearken not ye to your prophets nor to your diviners
nor to your dreamers nor to your enchanters nor to your sorcerers
which speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon
for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your
land and that i should drive you out and ye should perish
but the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king
of babylon and serve him those will i let remain still in their own
land saith the lord and they shall till it and dwell therein
i spake also to zedekiah king of judah according to all these
words saying bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon
and serve him and his people and live
why will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the
famine and by the pestilence as the lord hath spoken against the
nation that will not serve the king of babylon   therefore
hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you
saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a
lie unto you
for i have not sent them saith the lord yet they prophesy a
lie in my name that i might drive you out and that ye might perish
ye and the prophets that prophesy unto you
also i spake to the priests and to all this people saying thus
saith the lord hearken not to the words of your prophets that
prophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of the lords house
shall now shortly be brought again from babylon for they prophesy a
lie unto you
hearken not unto them serve the king of babylon and live
wherefore should this city be laid waste   but if they be
prophets and if the word of the lord be with them let them now make
intercession to the lord of hosts that the vessels which are left in
the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at
jerusalem go not to babylon
for thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the pillars and
concerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning the
residue of the vessels that remain in this city
which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not when he carried
away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from
jerusalem to babylon and all the nobles of judah and jerusalem
yea thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel concerning the
vessels that remain in the house of the lord and in the house of the
king of judah and of jerusalem  they shall be carried to
babylon and there shall they be until the day that i visit them
saith the lord then will i bring them up and restore them to this
place
and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign
of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month
that hananiah the son of azur the prophet which was of gibeon spake
unto me in the house of the lord in the presence of the priests and
of all the people saying  thus speaketh the lord of hosts the
god of israel saying i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon
within two full years will i bring again into this place all the
vessels of the lords house that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took
away from this place and carried them to babylon  and i will
bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah
with all the captives of judah that went into babylon saith the
lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon
then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the
presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that
stood in the house of the lord  even the prophet jeremiah said
amen the lord do so the lord perform thy words which thou hast
prophesied to bring again the vessels of the lords house and all
that is carried away captive from babylon into this place
nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears
and in the ears of all the people  the prophets that have been
before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many
countries and against great kingdoms of war and of evil and of
pestilence
the prophet which prophesieth of peace when the word of the
prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the
lord hath truly sent him
then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet
jeremiahs neck and brake it
and hananiah spake in the presence of all the people saying
thus saith the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar
king of babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two
full years and the prophet jeremiah went his way
then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet after
that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the
prophet jeremiah saying  go and tell hananiah saying thus
saith the lord thou hast broken the yokes of wood but thou shalt
make for them yokes of iron
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel i have put
a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may serve
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they shall serve him and i have
given him the beasts of the field also
then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet hear
now hananiah the lord hath not sent thee but thou makest this
people to trust in a lie
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will cast thee from off
the face of the earth this year thou shalt die because thou hast
taught rebellion against the lord
so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month
now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet
sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried
away captives and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the
people whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to
babylon  after that jeconiah the king and the queen and the
eunuchs the princes of judah and jerusalem and the carpenters and
the smiths were departed from jerusalem  by the hand of elasah
the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah whom zedekiah
king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon
saying  thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel unto all
that are carried away captives whom i have caused to be carried away
from jerusalem unto babylon  build ye houses and dwell in them
and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them  take ye wives and
beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your
daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that ye
may be increased there and not diminished
and seek the peace of the city whither i have caused you to be
carried away captives and pray unto the lord for it for in the peace
thereof shall ye have peace
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your
prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you
neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed
for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent
them saith the lord
for thus saith the lord that after seventy years be
accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word
toward you in causing you to return to this place
for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord
thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end
then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me
and i will hearken unto you
and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me
with all your heart
and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn away
your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from
all the places whither i have driven you saith the lord and i will
bring you again into the place whence i caused you to be carried away
captive
because ye have said the lord hath raised us up prophets in
babylon  know that thus saith the lord of the king that sitteth
upon the throne of david and of all the people that dwelleth in this
city and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into
captivity  thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will send
upon them the sword the famine and the pestilence and will make
them like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so evil
and i will persecute them with the sword with the famine and
with the pestilence and will deliver them to be removed to all the
kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and an astonishment and an
hissing and a reproach among all the nations whither i have driven
them  because they have not hearkened to my words saith the
lord which i sent unto them by my servants the prophets rising up
early and sending them but ye would not hear saith the lord
hear ye therefore the word of the lord all ye of the captivity
whom i have sent from jerusalem to babylon  thus saith the lord
of hosts the god of israel of ahab the son of kolaiah and of
zedekiah the son of maaseiah which prophesy a lie unto you in my
name behold i will deliver them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king
of babylon and he shall slay them before your eyes  and of them
shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of judah which are in
babylon saying the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab whom
the king of babylon roasted in the fire  because they have
committed villany in israel and have committed adultery with their
neighbours wives and have spoken lying words in my name which i
have not commanded them even i know and am a witness saith the
lord
thus shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamite saying
thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying
because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that
are at jerusalem and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest and
to all the priests saying  the lord hath made thee priest in
the stead of jehoiada the priest that ye should be officers in the
house of the lord for every man that is mad and maketh himself a
prophet that thou shouldest put him in prison and in the stocks
now therefore why hast thou not reproved jeremiah of anathoth
which maketh himself a prophet to you   for therefore he sent
unto us in babylon saying this captivity is long build ye houses
and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them
and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of
jeremiah the prophet
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying  send
to all them of the captivity saying thus saith the lord concerning
shemaiah the nehelamite because that shemaiah hath prophesied unto
you and i sent him not and he caused you to trust in a lie
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will punish shemaiah the
nehelamite and his seed he shall not have a man to dwell among this
people neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my people
saith the lord because he hath taught rebellion against the lord
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying  thus
speaketh the lord god of israel saying write thee all the words that
i have spoken unto thee in a book
for lo the days come saith the lord that i will bring again
the captivity of my people israel and judah saith the lord and i
will cause them to return to the land that i gave to their fathers
and they shall possess it
and these are the words that the lord spake concerning israel and
concerning judah
for thus saith the lord we have heard a voice of trembling of
fear and not of peace
ask ye now and see whether a man doth travail with child
wherefore do i see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman
in travail and all faces are turned into paleness   alas for
that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of
jacobs trouble but he shall be saved out of it
for it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts
that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy
bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him  but
they shall serve the lord their god and david their king whom i will
raise up unto them
therefore fear thou not o my servant jacob saith the lord
neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar
and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return
and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid
for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i make
a full end of all nations whither i have scattered thee yet i will
not make a full end of thee but i will correct thee in measure and
will not leave thee altogether unpunished
for thus saith the lord thy bruise is incurable and thy wound
is grievous
there is none to plead thy cause that thou mayest be bound up
thou hast no healing medicines
all thy lovers have forgotten thee they seek thee not for i
have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of
a cruel one for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins
were increased
why criest thou for thine affliction thy sorrow is incurable
for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased
i have done these things unto thee
therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and all
thine adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity and
they that spoil thee shall be a spoil and all that prey upon thee
will i give for a prey
for i will restore health unto thee and i will heal thee of thy
wounds saith the lord because they called thee an outcast saying
this is zion whom no man seeketh after
thus saith the lord behold i will bring again the captivity of
jacobs tents and have mercy on his dwellingplaces and the city
shall be builded upon her own heap and the palace shall remain after
the manner thereof
and out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them
that make merry and i will multiply them and they shall not be few
i will also glorify them and they shall not be small
their children also shall be as aforetime and their
congregation shall be established before me and i will punish all
that oppress them
and their nobles shall be of themselves and their governor
shall proceed from the midst of them and i will cause him to draw
near and he shall approach unto me for who is this that engaged his
heart to approach unto me saith the lord
and ye shall be my people and i will be your god
behold the whirlwind of the lord goeth forth with fury a
continuing whirlwind it shall fall with pain upon the head of the
wicked
the fierce anger of the lord shall not return until he hath
done it and until he have performed the intents of his heart in the
latter days ye shall consider it
at the same time saith the lord will i be the god of all the
families of israel and they shall be my people
thus saith the lord the people which were left of the sword
found grace in the wilderness even israel when i went to cause him
to rest
the lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea i have loved
thee with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness have i
drawn thee
again i will build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin of
israel thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and shalt go
forth in the dances of them that make merry
thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of samaria the
planters shall plant and shall eat them as common things
for there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the mount
ephraim shall cry arise ye and let us go up to zion unto the lord
our god
for thus saith the lord sing with gladness for jacob and shout
among the chief of the nations publish ye praise ye and say o
lord save thy people the remnant of israel
behold i will bring them from the north country and gather them
from the coasts of the earth and with them the blind and the lame
the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together a
great company shall return thither
they shall come with weeping and with supplications will i lead
them i will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight
way wherein they shall not stumble for i am a father to israel and
ephraim is my firstborn
hear the word of the lord o ye nations and declare it in the
isles afar off and say he that scattered israel will gather him and
keep him as a shepherd doth his flock
for the lord hath redeemed jacob and ransomed him from the hand
of him that was stronger than he
therefore they shall come and sing in the height of zion and
shall flow together to the goodness of the lord for wheat and for
wine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd and
their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow any
more at all
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance both young men and
old together for i will turn their mourning into joy and will
comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow
and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness and my
people shall be satisfied with my goodness saith the lord
thus saith the lord a voice was heard in ramah lamentation
and bitter weeping rahel weeping for her children refused to be
comforted for her children because they were not
thus saith the lord refrain thy voice from weeping and thine
eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the lord and
they shall come again from the land of the enemy
and there is hope in thine end saith the lord that thy
children shall come again to their own border
i have surely heard ephraim bemoaning himself thus thou hast
chastised me and i was chastised as a bullock unaccustomed to the
yoke turn thou me and i shall be turned for thou art the lord my
god
surely after that i was turned i repented and after that i was
instructed i smote upon my thigh i was ashamed yea even
confounded because i did bear the reproach of my youth
is ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant child for since i
spake against him i do earnestly remember him still therefore my
bowels are troubled for him i will surely have mercy upon him saith
the lord
set thee up waymarks make thee high heaps set thine heart
toward the highway even the way which thou wentest turn again o
virgin of israel turn again to these thy cities
how long wilt thou go about o thou backsliding daughter for
the lord hath created a new thing in the earth a woman shall compass
a man
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as yet they
shall use this speech in the land of judah and in the cities thereof
when i shall bring again their captivity the lord bless thee o
habitation of justice and mountain of holiness
and there shall dwell in judah itself and in all the cities
thereof together husbandmen and they that go forth with flocks
for i have satiated the weary soul and i have replenished every
sorrowful soul
upon this i awaked and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto me
behold the days come saith the lord that i will sow the house
of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man and with the
seed of beast
and it shall come to pass that like as i have watched over
them to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and to
destroy and to afflict so will i watch over them to build and to
plant saith the lord
in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten a
sour grape and the childrens teeth are set on edge
but every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that
eateth the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edge
behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new
covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah
not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the
day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of
egypt which my covenant they brake although i was an husband unto
them saith the lord  but this shall be the covenant that i will
make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i
will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts
and will be their god and they shall be my people
and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every
man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me
from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord for
i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more
thus saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by day
and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night
which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar the lord of hosts
is his name  if those ordinances depart from before me saith
the lord then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation
before me for ever
thus saith the lord if heaven above can be measured and the
foundations of the earth searched out beneath i will also cast off
all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that the city shall be
built to the lord from the tower of hananeel unto the gate of the
corner
and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon
the hill gareb and shall compass about to goath
and the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes and
all the fields unto the brook of kidron unto the corner of the horse
gate toward the east shall be holy unto the lord it shall not be
plucked up nor thrown down any more for ever
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of
zedekiah king of judah which was the eighteenth year of
nebuchadrezzar
for then the king of babylons army besieged jerusalem and
jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which was
in the king of judahs house
for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up saying wherefore
dost thou prophesy and say thus saith the lord behold i will give
this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall take it
and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand of
the chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king
of babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes
shall behold his eyes  and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon and
there shall he be until i visit him saith the lord though ye fight
with the chaldeans ye shall not prosper
and jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me saying
behold hanameel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto
thee saying buy thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of
redemption is thine to buy it
so hanameel mine uncles son came to me in the court of the
prison according to the word of the lord and said unto me buy my
field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the country of
benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is
thine buy it for thyself
then i knew that this was the word of the lord
and i bought the field of hanameel my uncles son that was in
anathoth and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silver
and i subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took
witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances
so i took the evidence of the purchase both that which was
sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open
and i gave the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah
the son of maaseiah in the sight of hanameel mine uncles son and in
the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the
purchase before all the jews that sat in the court of the prison
and i charged baruch before them saying  thus saith the
lord of hosts the god of israel take these evidences this evidence
of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is
open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many
days
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel houses and
fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land
now when i had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto
baruch the son of neriah i prayed unto the lord saying  ah
lord god behold thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great
power and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee
thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands and recompensest the
iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them
the great the mighty god the lord of hosts is his name  great
in counsel and mighty in work for thine eyes are open upon all the
ways of the sons of men to give every one according to his ways and
according to the fruit of his doings  which hast set signs and
wonders in the land of egypt even unto this day and in israel and
among other men and hast made thee a name as at this day  and
hast brought forth thy people israel out of the land of egypt with
signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and with a stretched
out arm and with great terror  and hast given them this land
which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them a land flowing
with milk and honey  and they came in and possessed it but
they obeyed not thy voice neither walked in thy law they have done
nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do therefore thou hast
caused all this evil to come upon them  behold the mounts they
are come unto the city to take it and the city is given into the hand
of the chaldeans that fight against it because of the sword and of
the famine and of the pestilence and what thou hast spoken is come
to pass and behold thou seest it
and thou hast said unto me o lord god buy thee the field for
money and take witnesses for the city is given into the hand of the
chaldeans
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying
behold i am the lord the god of all flesh is there any thing too
hard for me   therefore thus saith the lord behold i will give
this city into the hand of the chaldeans and into the hand of
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take it  and the
chaldeans that fight against this city shall come and set fire on
this city and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they have
offered incense unto baal and poured out drink offerings unto other
gods to provoke me to anger
for the children of israel and the children of judah have only
done evil before me from their youth for the children of israel have
only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands saith the
lord
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and
of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day that i
should remove it from before my face  because of all the evil of
the children of israel and of the children of judah which they have
done to provoke me to anger they their kings their princes their
priests and their prophets and the men of judah and the inhabitants
of jerusalem
and they have turned unto me the back and not the face though
i taught them rising up early and teaching them yet they have not
hearkened to receive instruction
but they set their abominations in the house which is called by
my name to defile it
and they built the high places of baal which are in the valley
of the son of hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass
through the fire unto molech which i commanded them not neither came
it into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judah
to sin
and now therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel
concerning this city whereof ye say it shall be delivered into the
hand of the king of babylon by the sword and by the famine and by
the pestilence  behold i will gather them out of all countries
whither i have driven them in mine anger and in my fury and in great
wrath and i will bring them again unto this place and i will cause
them to dwell safely  and they shall be my people and i will be
their god  and i will give them one heart and one way that
they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children
after them  and i will make an everlasting covenant with them
that i will not turn away from them to do them good but i will put
my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me
yea i will rejoice over them to do them good and i will plant
them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole
soul
for thus saith the lord like as i have brought all this great
evil upon this people so will i bring upon them all the good that i
have promised them
and fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say it is
desolate without man or beast it is given into the hand of the
chaldeans
men shall buy fields for money and subscribe evidences and
seal them and take witnesses in the land of benjamin and in the
places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah and in the cities
of the mountains and in the cities of the valley and in the cities
of the south for i will cause their captivity to return saith the
lord
moreover the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time
while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison saying  thus
saith the lord the maker thereof the lord that formed it to
establish it the lord is his name  call unto me and i will
answer thee and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knowest
not
for thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning the houses
of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of judah which
are thrown down by the mounts and by the sword  they come to
fight with the chaldeans but it is to fill them with the dead bodies
of men whom i have slain in mine anger and in my fury and for all
whose wickedness i have hid my face from this city
behold i will bring it health and cure and i will cure them
and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth
and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of
israel to return and will build them as at the first
and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they
have sinned against me and i will pardon all their iniquities
whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against
me
and it shall be to me a name of joy a praise and an honour
before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good
that i do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the
goodness and for all the prosperity that i procure unto it
thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this place
which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast even in
the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are
desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast
the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the
bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall
say praise the lord of hosts for the lord is good for his mercy
endureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of
praise into the house of the lord for i will cause to return the
captivity of the land as at the first saith the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts again in this place which is
desolate without man and without beast and in all the cities thereof
shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down
in the cities of the mountains in the cities of the vale and
in the cities of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the
places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah shall the flocks
pass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the lord
behold the days come saith the lord that i will perform that
good thing which i have promised unto the house of israel and to the
house of judah
in those days and at that time will i cause the branch of
righteousness to grow up unto david and he shall execute judgment and
righteousness in the land
in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwell
safely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called the lord
our righteousness
for thus saith the lord david shall never want a man to sit
upon the throne of the house of israel  neither shall the
priests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings and
to kindle meat offerings and to do sacrifice continually
and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah saying  thus
saith the lord if ye can break my covenant of the day and my
covenant of the night and that there should not be day and night in
their season  then may also my covenant be broken with david my
servant that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne and
with the levites the priests my ministers
as the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of
the sea measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant and
the levites that minister unto me
moreover the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying
considerest thou not what this people have spoken saying the two
families which the lord hath chosen he hath even cast them off thus
they have despised my people that they should be no more a nation
before them
thus saith the lord if my covenant be not with day and night
and if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth
then will i cast away the seed of jacob and david my servant so that
i will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abraham
isaac and jacob for i will cause their captivity to return and have
mercy on them
the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms
of the earth of his dominion and all the people fought against
jerusalem and against all the cities thereof saying  thus saith
the lord the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judah
and tell him thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into
the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire
and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken
and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of
the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and
thou shalt go to babylon
yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thus
saith the lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword  but thou
shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former
kings which were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee and
they will lament thee saying ah lord for i have pronounced the
word saith the lord
then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiah
king of judah in jerusalem  when the king of babylons army
fought against jerusalem and against all the cities of judah that
were left against lachish and against azekah for these defenced
cities remained of the cities of judah
this is the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord after
that the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which
were at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them  that every man
should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being an
hebrew or an hebrewess go free that none should serve himself of
them to wit of a jew his brother
now when all the princes and all the people which had entered
into the covenant heard that every one should let his manservant and
every one his maidservant go free that none should serve themselves
of them any more then they obeyed and let them go
but afterward they turned and caused the servants and the
handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into
subjection for servants and for handmaids
therefore the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord
saying  thus saith the lord the god of israel i made a
covenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of
the land of egypt out of the house of bondmen saying  at the
end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an hebrew which
hath been sold unto thee and when he hath served thee six years thou
shalt let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not unto
me neither inclined their ear
and ye were now turned and had done right in my sight in
proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour and ye had made a
covenant before me in the house which is called by my name  but
ye turned and polluted my name and caused every man his servant and
every man his handmaid whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure
to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for
servants and for handmaids
therefore thus saith the lord ye have not hearkened unto me in
proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to his
neighbour behold i proclaim a liberty for you saith the lord to
the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and i will make you
to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth
and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant
which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made
before me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the
parts thereof  the princes of judah and the princes of
jerusalem the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of the
land which passed between the parts of the calf  i will even
give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them
that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the
fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth
and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into the
hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life
and into the hand of the king of babylons army which are gone up
from you
behold i will command saith the lord and cause them to return
to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burn
it with fire and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without
an inhabitant
the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the days of
jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying  go unto the
house of the rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into the
house of the lord into one of the chambers and give them wine to
drink
then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habaziniah
and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the
rechabites  and i brought them into the house of the lord into
the chamber of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah a man of god
which was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamber
of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door  and i set
before the sons of the house of the rechabites pots full of wine and
cups and i said unto them drink ye wine
but they said we will drink no wine for jonadab the son of
rechab our father commanded us saying ye shall drink no wine
neither ye nor your sons for ever  neither shall ye build house
nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days ye
shall dwell in tents that ye may live many days in the land where ye
be strangers
thus have we obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our
father in all that he hath charged us to drink no wine all our days
we our wives our sons nor our daughters  nor to build houses
for us to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed
but we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according
to all that jonadab our father commanded us
but it came to pass when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up
into the land that we said come and let us go to jerusalem for fear
of the army of the chaldeans and for fear of the army of the syrians
so we dwell at jerusalem
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying  thus
saith the lord of hosts the god of israel go and tell the men of
judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem will ye not receive
instruction to hearken to my words saith the lord
the words of jonadab the son of rechab that he commanded his
sons not to drink wine are performed for unto this day they drink
none but obey their fathers commandment notwithstanding i have
spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye hearkened not unto
me
i have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets rising
up early and sending them saying return ye now every man from his
evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve
them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to
your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto
me
because the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have performed the
commandment of their father which he commanded them but this people
hath not hearkened unto me  therefore thus saith the lord god of
hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon judah and upon all
the inhabitants of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounced
against them because i have spoken unto them but they have not
heard and i have called unto them but they have not answered
and jeremiah said unto the house of the rechabites thus saith
the lord of hosts the god of israel because ye have obeyed the
commandment of jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and
done according unto all that he hath commanded you  therefore
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel jonadab the son of
rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever
and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of
josiah king of judah that this word came unto jeremiah from the lord
saying  take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the
words that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah
and against all the nations from the day i spake unto thee from the
days of josiah even unto this day
it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i
purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil
way that i may forgive their iniquity and their sin
then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah and baruch wrote
from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord which he had
spoken unto him upon a roll of a book
and jeremiah commanded baruch saying i am shut up i cannot go
into the house of the lord  therefore go thou and read in the
roll which thou hast written from my mouth the words of the lord in
the ears of the people in the lords house upon the fasting day and
also thou shalt read them in the ears of all judah that come out of
their cities
it may be they will present their supplication before the lord
and will return every one from his evil way for great is the anger
and the fury that the lord hath pronounced against this people
and baruch the son of neriah did according to all that jeremiah
the prophet commanded him reading in the book the words of the lord
in the lords house
and it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of
josiah king of judah in the ninth month that they proclaimed a fast
before the lord to all the people in jerusalem and to all the people
that came from the cities of judah unto jerusalem
then read baruch in the book the words of jeremiah in the house
of the lord in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe
in the higher court at the entry of the new gate of the lords house
in the ears of all the people
when michaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan had heard
out of the book all the words of the lord  then he went down
into the kings house into the scribes chamber and lo all the
princes sat there even elishama the scribe and delaiah the son of
shemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son of
shaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the princes
then michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had
heard when baruch read the book in the ears of the people
therefore all the princes sent jehudi the son of nethaniah the
son of shelemiah the son of cushi unto baruch saying take in thine
hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people and
come so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in his hand and came
unto them
and they said unto him sit down now and read it in our ears
so baruch read it in their ears
now it came to pass when they had heard all the words they
were afraid both one and other and said unto baruch we will surely
tell the king of all these words
and they asked baruch saying tell us now how didst thou write
all these words at his mouth   then baruch answered them he
pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth and i wrote them
with ink in the book
then said the princes unto baruch go hide thee thou and
jeremiah and let no man know where ye be
and they went in to the king into the court but they laid up
the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe and told all the words
in the ears of the king
so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll and he took it out of
elishama the scribes chamber and jehudi read it in the ears of the
king and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king
now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month and
there was a fire on the hearth burning before him
and it came to pass that when jehudi had read three or four
leaves he cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that
was on the hearth until all the roll was consumed in the fire that
was on the hearth
yet they were not afraid nor rent their garments neither the
king nor any of his servants that heard all these words
nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made
intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll but he would
not hear them
but the king commanded jerahmeel the son of hammelech and
seraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to take
baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord hid them
then the word of the lord came to jeremiah after that the king
had burned the roll and the words which baruch wrote at the mouth of
jeremiah saying  take thee again another roll and write in it
all the former words that were in the first roll which jehoiakim the
king of judah hath burned
and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah thus saith the
lord thou hast burned this roll saying why hast thou written
therein saying the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy
this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast
therefore thus saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah he shall
have none to sit upon the throne of david and his dead body shall be
cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost
and i will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
iniquity and i will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of
jerusalem and upon the men of judah all the evil that i have
pronounced against them but they hearkened not
then took jeremiah another roll and gave it to baruch the
scribe the son of neriah who wrote therein from the mouth of
jeremiah all the words of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had
burned in the fire and there were added besides unto them many like
words
and king zedekiah the son of josiah reigned instead of coniah the
son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the
land of judah
but neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land did
hearken unto the words of the lord which he spake by the prophet
jeremiah
and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and
zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah
saying pray now unto the lord our god for us
now jeremiah came in and went out among the people for they had
not put him into prison
then pharaohs army was come forth out of egypt and when the
chaldeans that besieged jerusalem heard tidings of them they departed
from jerusalem
then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah saying
thus saith the lord the god of israel thus shall ye say to the
king of judah that sent you unto me to enquire of me behold
pharaohs army which is come forth to help you shall return to egypt
into their own land
and the chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city
and take it and burn it with fire
thus saith the lord deceive not yourselves saying the
chaldeans shall surely depart from us for they shall not depart
for though ye had smitten the whole army of the chaldeans that
fight against you and there remained but wounded men among them yet
should they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with
fire
and it came to pass that when the army of the chaldeans was
broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaohs army  then
jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin
to separate himself thence in the midst of the people
and when he was in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward
was there whose name was irijah the son of shelemiah the son of
hananiah and he took jeremiah the prophet saying thou fallest away
to the chaldeans
then said jeremiah it is false i fall not away to the
chaldeans
but he hearkened not to him so irijah took jeremiah and brought him
to the princes
wherefore the princes were wroth with jeremiah and smote him
and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe for they
had made that the prison
when jeremiah was entered into the dungeon and into the cabins
and jeremiah had remained there many days  then zedekiah the
king sent and took him out and the king asked him secretly in his
house and said is there any word from the lord and jeremiah said
there is for said he thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the
king of babylon
moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah what have i offended
against thee or against thy servants or against this people that ye
have put me in prison   where are now your prophets which
prophesied unto you saying the king of babylon shall not come
against you nor against this land   therefore hear now i pray
thee o my lord the king let my supplication i pray thee be
accepted before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house of
jonathan the scribe lest i die there
then zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit
jeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give him
daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street until all the bread
in the city were spent
thus jeremiah remained in the court of the prison
then shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of
pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of
malchiah heard the words that jeremiah had spoken unto all the
people saying  thus saith the lord he that remaineth in this
city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but
he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live for he shall have his
life for a prey and shall live
thus saith the lord this city shall surely be given into the
hand of the king of babylons army which shall take it
therefore the princes said unto the king we beseech thee let
this man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men
of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people in
speaking such words unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare of
this people but the hurt
then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the
king is not he that can do any thing against you
then took they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of
malchiah the son of hammelech that was in the court of the prison
and they let down jeremiah with cords and in the dungeon there was no
water but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire
now when ebedmelech the ethiopian one of the eunuchs which was
in the kings house heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon
the king then sitting in the gate of benjamin  ebedmelech went
forth out of the kings house and spake to the king saying  my
lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to
jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is
like to die for hunger in the place where he is for there is no more
bread in the city
then the king commanded ebedmelech the ethiopian saying take
from hence thirty men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out
of the dungeon before he die
so ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the house of
the king under the treasury and took thence old cast clouts and old
rotten rags and let them down by cords into the dungeon to jeremiah
and ebedmelech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah put now these
old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords
and jeremiah did so
so they drew up jeremiah with cords and took him up out of the
dungeon and jeremiah remained in the court of the prison
then zedekiah the king sent and took jeremiah the prophet unto
him into the third entry that is in the house of the lord and the
king said unto jeremiah i will ask thee a thing hide nothing from
me
then jeremiah said unto zedekiah if i declare it unto thee
wilt thou not surely put me to death and if i give thee counsel wilt
thou not hearken unto me   so zedekiah the king sware secretly
unto jeremiah saying as the lord liveth that made us this soul i
will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of
these men that seek thy life
then said jeremiah unto zedekiah thus saith the lord the god
of hosts the god of israel if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the
king of babylons princes then thy soul shall live and this city
shall not be burned with fire and thou shalt live and thine house
but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylons princes
then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans and they
shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hand
and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the
jews that are fallen to the chaldeans lest they deliver me into their
hand and they mock me
but jeremiah said they shall not deliver thee obey i beseech
thee the voice of the lord which i speak unto thee so it shall be
well unto thee and thy soul shall live
but if thou refuse to go forth this is the word that the lord
hath shewed me  and behold all the women that are left in the
king of judahs house shall be brought forth to the king of babylons
princes and those women shall say thy friends have set thee on and
have prevailed against thee thy feet are sunk in the mire and they
are turned away back
so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the
chaldeans and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but shalt be
taken by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt cause this
city to be burned with fire
then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these
words and thou shalt not die
but if the princes hear that i have talked with thee and they
come unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us now what thou hast
said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee to
death also what the king said unto thee  then thou shalt say
unto them i presented my supplication before the king that he would
not cause me to return to jonathans house to die there
then came all the princes unto jeremiah and asked him and he
told them according to all these words that the king had commanded so
they left off speaking with him for the matter was not perceived
so jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that
jerusalem was taken and he was there when jerusalem was taken
in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month
came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army against
jerusalem and they besieged it
and in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month the
ninth day of the month the city was broken up
and all the princes of the king of babylon came in and sat in
the middle gate even nergalsharezer samgarnebo sarsechim rabsaris
nergalsharezer rabmag with all the residue of the princes of the
king of babylon
and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah saw
them and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of
the city by night by the way of the kings garden by the gate
betwixt the two walls and he went out the way of the plain
but the chaldeans army pursued after them and overtook zedekiah
in the plains of jericho and when they had taken him they brought
him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of
hamath where he gave judgment upon him
then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah
before his eyes also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of
judah
moreover he put out zedekiahs eyes and bound him with chains
to carry him to babylon
and the chaldeans burned the kings house and the houses of the
people with fire and brake down the walls of jerusalem
then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
into babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city and
those that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the people
that remained
but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the
people which had nothing in the land of judah and gave them
vineyards and fields at the same time
now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning
jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying  take
him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as
he shall say unto thee
so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushasban
rabsaris and nergalsharezer rabmag and all the king of babylons
princes  even they sent and took jeremiah out of the court of
the prison and committed him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son
of shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among the
people
now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he was shut
up in the court of the prison saying  go and speak to
ebedmelech the ethiopian saying thus saith the lord of hosts the
god of israel behold i will bring my words upon this city for evil
and not for good and they shall be accomplished in that day before
thee
but i will deliver thee in that day saith the lord and thou
shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid
for i will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by the
sword but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee because thou hast
put thy trust in me saith the lord
the word that came to jeremiah from the lord after that
nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah when
he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried
away captive of jerusalem and judah which were carried away captive
unto babylon
and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto him
the lord thy god hath pronounced this evil upon this place
now the lord hath brought it and done according as he hath said
because ye have sinned against the lord and have not obeyed his
voice therefore this thing is come upon you
and now behold i loose thee this day from the chains which were
upon thine hand if it seem good unto thee to come with me into
babylon come and i will look well unto thee but if it seem ill unto
thee to come with me into babylon forbear behold all the land is
before thee whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go
thither go
now while he was not yet gone back he said go back also to
gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of
babylon hath made governor over the cities of judah and dwell with
him among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto
thee to go so the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a
reward and let him go
then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and
dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land
now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields
even they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made
gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had committed
unto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land of
them that were not carried away captive to babylon  then they
came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and
johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah and seraiah the son of
tanhumeth and the sons of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah the
son of a maachathite they and their men
and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them
and to their men saying fear not to serve the chaldeans dwell in
the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with
you
as for me behold i will dwell at mizpah to serve the
chaldeans which will come unto us but ye gather ye wine and summer
fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and dwell in your
cities that ye have taken
likewise when all the jews that were in moab and among the
ammonites and in edom and that were in all the countries heard that
the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had set
over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan  even
all the jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and
came to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gathered wine
and summer fruits very much
moreover johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the
forces that were in the fields came to gedaliah to mizpah  and
said unto him dost thou certainly know that baalis the king of the
ammonites hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee but
gedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not
then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah
secretly saying let me go i pray thee and i will slay ishmael the
son of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he slay
thee that all the jews which are gathered unto thee should be
scattered and the remnant in judah perish   but gedaliah the
son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do
this thing for thou speakest falsely of ishmael
now it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of
nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and the princes of
the king even ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam
to mizpah and there they did eat bread together in mizpah
then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men that
were with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan
with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had made
governor over the land
ishmael also slew all the jews that were with him even with
gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldeans that were found there and the
men of war
and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah
and no man knew it  that there came certain from shechem from
shiloh and from samaria even fourscore men having their beards
shaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves with
offerings and incense in their hand to bring them to the house of the
lord
and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet
them weeping all along as he went and it came to pass as he met
them he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam
and it was so when they came into the midst of the city that
ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst
of the pit he and the men that were with him
but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slay us
not for we have treasures in the field of wheat and of barley and
of oil and of honey so he forbare and slew them not among their
brethren
now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the
men whom he had slain because of gedaliah was it which asa the king
had made for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son of
nethaniah filled it with them that were slain
then ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people
that were in mizpah even the kings daughters and all the people
that remained in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had
committed to gedaliah the son of ahikam and ishmael the son of
nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the
ammonites
but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the
forces that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son
of nethaniah had done  then they took all the men and went to
fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great
waters that are in gibeon
now it came to pass that when all the people which were with
ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the
forces that were with him then they were glad
so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from
mizpah cast about and returned and went unto johanan the son of
kareah
but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight
men and went to the ammonites
then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the
forces that were with him all the remnant of the people whom he had
recovered from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that
he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam even mighty men of war and
the women and the children and the eunuchs whom he had brought
again from gibeon  and they departed and dwelt in the
habitation of chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter into
egypt  because of the chaldeans for they were afraid of them
because ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of
ahikam whom the king of babylon made governor in the land
then all the captains of the forces and johanan the son of
kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from the
least even unto the greatest came near  and said unto jeremiah
the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before
thee and pray for us unto the lord thy god even for all this
remnant for we are left but a few of many as thine eyes do behold
us  that the lord thy god may shew us the way wherein we may
walk and the thing that we may do
then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard you
behold i will pray unto the lord your god according to your words
and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing the lord shall answer
you i will declare it unto you i will keep nothing back from you
then they said to jeremiah the lord be a true and faithful
witness between us if we do not even according to all things for the
which the lord thy god shall send thee to us
whether it be good or whether it be evil we will obey the voice
of the lord our god to whom we send thee that it may be well with
us when we obey the voice of the lord our god
and it came to pass after ten days that the word of the lord
came unto jeremiah
then called he johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of
the forces which were with him and all the people from the least even
to the greatest  and said unto them thus saith the lord the god
of israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before
him  if ye will still abide in this land then will i build you
and not pull you down and i will plant you and not pluck you up for
i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you
be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom ye are afraid be
not afraid of him saith the lord for i am with you to save you and
to deliver you from his hand
and i will shew mercies unto you that he may have mercy upon
you and cause you to return to your own land
but if ye say we will not dwell in this land neither obey the
voice of the lord your god  saying no but we will go into the
land of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the
trumpet nor have hunger of bread and there will we dwell  and
now therefore hear the word of the lord ye remnant of judah thus
saith the lord of hosts the god of israel if ye wholly set your
faces to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there  then it
shall come to pass that the sword which ye feared shall overtake
you there in the land of egypt and the famine whereof ye were
afraid shall follow close after you there in egypt and there ye
shall die
so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into
egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famine
and by the pestilence and none of them shall remain or escape from
the evil that i will bring upon them
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as mine
anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of
jerusalem so shall my fury be poured forth upon you when ye shall
enter into egypt and ye shall be an execration and an astonishment
and a curse and a reproach and ye shall see this place no more
the lord hath said concerning you o ye remnant of judah go ye
not into egypt know certainly that i have admonished you this day
for ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me unto the lord
your god saying pray for us unto the lord our god and according
unto all that the lord our god shall say so declare unto us and we
will do it
and now i have this day declared it to you but ye have not
obeyed the voice of the lord your god nor any thing for the which he
hath sent me unto you
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword by
the famine and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire to
go and to sojourn
and it came to pass that when jeremiah had made an end of
speaking unto all the people all the words of the lord their god for
which the lord their god had sent him to them even all these words
then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of
kareah and all the proud men saying unto jeremiah thou speakest
falsely the lord our god hath not sent thee to say go not into egypt
to sojourn there  but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on
against us for to deliver us into the hand of the chaldeans that
they might put us to death and carry us away captives into babylon
so johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces
and all the people obeyed not the voice of the lord to dwell in the
land of judah
but johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the
forces took all the remnant of judah that were returned from all
nations whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of judah
even men and women and children and the kings daughters and
every person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with
gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the
prophet and baruch the son of neriah
so they came into the land of egypt for they obeyed not the
voice of the lord thus came they even to tahpanhes
then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanhes
saying  take great stones in thine hand and hide them in the
clay in the brickkiln which is at the entry of pharaohs house in
tahpanhes in the sight of the men of judah  and say unto them
thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will send
and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will set
his throne upon these stones that i have hid and he shall spread his
royal pavilion over them
and when he cometh he shall smite the land of egypt and
deliver such as are for death to death and such as are for captivity
to captivity and such as are for the sword to the sword
and i will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt and
he shall burn them and carry them away captives and he shall array
himself with the land of egypt as a shepherd putteth on his garment
and he shall go forth from thence in peace
he shall break also the images of bethshemesh that is in the
land of egypt and the houses of the gods of the egyptians shall he
burn with fire
the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the jews which
dwell in the land of egypt which dwell at migdol and at tahpanhes
and at noph and in the country of pathros saying  thus saith
the lord of hosts the god of israel ye have seen all the evil that i
have brought upon jerusalem and upon all the cities of judah and
behold this day they are a desolation and no man dwelleth therein
because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke
me to anger in that they went to burn incense and to serve other
gods whom they knew not neither they ye nor your fathers
howbeit i sent unto you all my servants the prophets rising
early and sending them saying oh do not this abominable thing that
i hate
but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear to turn from their
wickedness to burn no incense unto other gods
wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth and was
kindled in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem and
they are wasted and desolate as at this day
therefore now thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of
israel wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls to cut
off from you man and woman child and suckling out of judah to leave
you none to remain  in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the
works of your hands burning incense unto other gods in the land of
egypt whither ye be gone to dwell that ye might cut yourselves off
and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of
the earth   have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and
the wickedness of the kings of judah and the wickedness of their
wives and your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives
which they have committed in the land of judah and in the streets of
jerusalem   they are not humbled even unto this day neither
have they feared nor walked in my law nor in my statutes that i set
before you and before your fathers
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel
behold i will set my face against you for evil and to cut off all
judah
and i will take the remnant of judah that have set their faces
to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there and they shall all be
consumed and fall in the land of egypt they shall even be consumed
by the sword and by the famine they shall die from the least even
unto the greatest by the sword and by the famine and they shall be
an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach
for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt as i
have punished jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by the
pestilence  so that none of the remnant of judah which are gone
into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain that
they should return into the land of judah to the which they have a
desire to return to dwell there for none shall return but such as
shall escape
then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense
unto other gods and all the women that stood by a great multitude
even all the people that dwelt in the land of egypt in pathros
answered jeremiah saying  as for the word that thou hast spoken
unto us in the name of the lord we will not hearken unto thee
but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our
own mouth to burn incense unto the queen of heaven and to pour out
drink offerings unto her as we have done we and our fathers our
kings and our princes in the cities of judah and in the streets of
jerusalem for then had we plenty of victuals and were well and saw
no evil
but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven
and to pour out drink offerings unto her we have wanted all things
and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine
and when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured
out drink offerings unto her did we make her cakes to worship her
and pour out drink offerings unto her without our men   then
jeremiah said unto all the people to the men and to the women and
to all the people which had given him that answer saying  the
incense that ye burned in the cities of judah and in the streets of
jerusalem ye and your fathers your kings and your princes and the
people of the land did not the lord remember them and came it not
into his mind   so that the lord could no longer bear because
of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which ye
have committed therefore is your land a desolation and an
astonishment and a curse without an inhabitant as at this day
because ye have burned incense and because ye have sinned
against the lord and have not obeyed the voice of the lord nor
walked in his law nor in his statutes nor in his testimonies
therefore this evil is happened unto you as at this day
moreover jeremiah said unto all the people and to all the
women hear the word of the lord all judah that are in the land of
egypt  thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel saying
ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and fulfilled
with your hand saying we will surely perform our vows that we have
vowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink
offerings unto her ye will surely accomplish your vows and surely
perform your vows
therefore hear ye the word of the lord all judah that dwell in
the land of egypt behold i have sworn by my great name saith the
lord that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of
judah in all the land of egypt saying the lord god liveth
behold i will watch over them for evil and not for good and
all the men of judah that are in the land of egypt shall be consumed
by the sword and by the famine until there be an end of them
yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the
land of egypt into the land of judah and all the remnant of judah
that are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall know
whose words shall stand mine or theirs
and this shall be a sign unto you saith the lord that i will
punish you in this place that ye may know that my words shall surely
stand against you for evil  thus saith the lord behold i will
give pharaohhophra king of egypt into the hand of his enemies and
into the hand of them that seek his life as i gave zedekiah king of
judah into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon his enemy and
that sought his life
the word that jeremiah the prophet spake unto baruch the son of
neriah when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of
jeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of
judah saying  thus saith the lord the god of israel unto thee
o baruch  thou didst say woe is me now for the lord hath added
grief to my sorrow i fainted in my sighing and i find no rest
thus shalt thou say unto him the lord saith thus behold that
which i have built will i break down and that which i have planted i
will pluck up even this whole land
and seekest thou great things for thyself seek them not for
behold i will bring evil upon all flesh saith the lord but thy life
will i give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest
the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet against
the gentiles  against egypt against the army of pharaohnecho
king of egypt which was by the river euphrates in carchemish which
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote in the fourth year of jehoiakim
the son of josiah king of judah
order ye the buckler and shield and draw near to battle
harness the horses and get up ye horsemen and stand forth with
your helmets furbish the spears and put on the brigandines
wherefore have i seen them dismayed and turned away back and
their mighty ones are beaten down and are fled apace and look not
back for fear was round about saith the lord
let not the swift flee away nor the mighty man escape they
shall stumble and fall toward the north by the river euphrates
who is this that cometh up as a flood whose waters are moved as
the rivers   egypt riseth up like a flood and his waters are
moved like the rivers and he saith i will go up and will cover the
earth i will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof
come up ye horses and rage ye chariots and let the mighty men
come forth the ethiopians and the libyans that handle the shield
and the lydians that handle and bend the bow
for this is the day of the lord god of hosts a day of
vengeance that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword
shall devour and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood
for the lord god of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the
river euphrates
go up into gilead and take balm o virgin the daughter of
egypt in vain shalt thou use many medicines for thou shalt not be
cured
the nations have heard of thy shame and thy cry hath filled the
land for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty and they
are fallen both together
the word that the lord spake to jeremiah the prophet how
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon should come and smite the land of
egypt
declare ye in egypt and publish in migdol and publish in noph
and in tahpanhes say ye stand fast and prepare thee for the sword
shall devour round about thee
why are thy valiant men swept away they stood not because the
lord did drive them
he made many to fall yea one fell upon another and they said
arise and let us go again to our own people and to the land of our
nativity from the oppressing sword
they did cry there pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise he
hath passed the time appointed
as i live saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts
surely as tabor is among the mountains and as carmel by the sea so
shall he come
o thou daughter dwelling in egypt furnish thyself to go into
captivity for noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant
egypt is like a very fair heifer but destruction cometh it
cometh out of the north
also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks
for they also are turned back and are fled away together they did
not stand because the day of their calamity was come upon them and
the time of their visitation
the voice thereof shall go like a serpent for they shall march
with an army and come against her with axes as hewers of wood
they shall cut down her forest saith the lord though it cannot
be searched because they are more than the grasshoppers and are
innumerable
the daughter of egypt shall be confounded she shall be
delivered into the hand of the people of the north
the lord of hosts the god of israel saith behold i will
punish the multitude of no and pharaoh and egypt with their gods
and their kings even pharaoh and all them that trust in him
and i will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives
and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand
of his servants and afterward it shall be inhabited as in the days
of old saith the lord
but fear not thou o my servant jacob and be not dismayed o
israel for behold i will save thee from afar off and thy seed from
the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and be in rest
and at ease and none shall make him afraid
fear thou not o jacob my servant saith the lord for i am with
thee for i will make a full end of all the nations whither i have
driven thee but i will not make a full end of thee but correct thee
in measure yet will i not leave thee wholly unpunished
the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against
the philistines before that pharaoh smote gaza
thus saith the lord behold waters rise up out of the north and
shall be an overflowing flood and shall overflow the land and all
that is therein the city and them that dwell therein then the men
shall cry and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses
at the rushing of his chariots and at the rumbling of his wheels the
fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands
because of the day that cometh to spoil all the philistines and
to cut off from tyrus and zidon every helper that remaineth for the
lord will spoil the philistines the remnant of the country of
caphtor
baldness is come upon gaza ashkelon is cut off with the remnant
of their valley how long wilt thou cut thyself   o thou sword of
the lord how long will it be ere thou be quiet put up thyself into
thy scabbard rest and be still
how can it be quiet seeing the lord hath given it a charge
against ashkelon and against the sea shore there hath he appointed
it
against moab thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel woe
unto nebo for it is spoiled kiriathaim is confounded and taken
misgab is confounded and dismayed
there shall be no more praise of moab in heshbon they have
devised evil against it come and let us cut it off from being a
nation also thou shalt be cut down o madmen the sword shall pursue
thee
a voice of crying shall be from horonaim spoiling and great
destruction
moab is destroyed her little ones have caused a cry to be heard
for in the going up of luhith continual weeping shall go up for
in the going down of horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of
destruction
flee save your lives and be like the heath in the wilderness
for because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures
thou shalt also be taken and chemosh shall go forth into captivity
with his priests and his princes together
and the spoiler shall come upon every city and no city shall
escape the valley also shall perish and the plain shall be
destroyed as the lord hath spoken
give wings unto moab that it may flee and get away for the
cities thereof shall be desolate without any to dwell therein
cursed be he that doeth the work of the lord deceitfully and
cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood
moab hath been at ease from his youth and he hath settled on
his lees and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel neither
hath he gone into captivity therefore his taste remained in him and
his scent is not changed
therefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will
send unto him wanderers that shall cause him to wander and shall
empty his vessels and break their bottles
and moab shall be ashamed of chemosh as the house of israel was
ashamed of bethel their confidence
how say ye we are mighty and strong men for the war
moab is spoiled and gone up out of her cities and his chosen young
men are gone down to the slaughter saith the king whose name is the
lord of hosts
the calamity of moab is near to come and his affliction hasteth
fast
all ye that are about him bemoan him and all ye that know his
name say how is the strong staff broken and the beautiful rod
thou daughter that dost inhabit dibon come down from thy glory
and sit in thirst for the spoiler of moab shall come upon thee and
he shall destroy thy strong holds
o inhabitant of aroer stand by the way and espy ask him that
fleeth and her that escapeth and say what is done   moab is
confounded for it is broken down howl and cry tell ye it in arnon
that moab is spoiled  and judgment is come upon the plain
country upon holon and upon jahazah and upon mephaath  and
upon dibon and upon nebo and upon bethdiblathaim  and upon
kiriathaim and upon bethgamul and upon bethmeon  and upon
kerioth and upon bozrah and upon all the cities of the land of moab
far or near
the horn of moab is cut off and his arm is broken saith the
lord
make ye him drunken for he magnified himself against the lord
moab also shall wallow in his vomit and he also shall be in derision
for was not israel a derision unto thee was he found among
thieves  for since thou spakest of him thou skippedst for joy
o ye that dwell in moab leave the cities and dwell in the
rock and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the
holes mouth
we have heard the pride of moab he is exceeding proud his
loftiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the haughtiness of
his heart
i know his wrath saith the lord but it shall not be so his
lies shall not so effect it
therefore will i howl for moab and i will cry out for all moab
mine heart shall mourn for the men of kirheres
o vine of sibmah i will weep for thee with the weeping of
jazer thy plants are gone over the sea they reach even to the sea of
jazer the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy
vintage
and joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field and from
the land of moab and i have caused wine to fail from the winepresses
none shall tread with shouting their shouting shall be no shouting
from the cry of heshbon even unto elealeh and even unto jahaz
have they uttered their voice from zoar even unto horonaim as an
heifer of three years old for the waters also of nimrim shall be
desolate
moreover i will cause to cease in moab saith the lord him that
offereth in the high places and him that burneth incense to his gods
therefore mine heart shall sound for moab like pipes and mine
heart shall sound like pipes for the men of kirheres because the
riches that he hath gotten are perished
for every head shall be bald and every beard clipped upon all
the hands shall be cuttings and upon the loins sackcloth
there shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of
moab and in the streets thereof for i have broken moab like a vessel
wherein is no pleasure saith the lord
they shall howl saying how is it broken down how hath moab
turned the back with shame so shall moab be a derision and a
dismaying to all them about him
for thus saith the lord behold he shall fly as an eagle and
shall spread his wings over moab
kerioth is taken and the strong holds are surprised and the
mighty mens hearts in moab at that day shall be as the heart of a
woman in her pangs
and moab shall be destroyed from being a people because he hath
magnified himself against the lord
fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon thee o
inhabitant of moab saith the lord
he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit and he
that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for i will
bring upon it even upon moab the year of their visitation saith the
lord
they that fled stood under the shadow of heshbon because of the
force but a fire shall come forth out of heshbon and a flame from
the midst of sihon and shall devour the corner of moab and the crown
of the head of the tumultuous ones
woe be unto thee o moab the people of chemosh perisheth for
thy sons are taken captives and thy daughters captives
yet will i bring again the captivity of moab in the latter days
saith the lord thus far is the judgment of moab
concerning the ammonites thus saith the lord hath israel no
sons  hath he no heir why then doth their king inherit gad and his
people dwell in his cities   therefore behold the days come
saith the lord that i will cause an alarm of war to be heard in
rabbah of the ammonites and it shall be a desolate heap and her
daughters shall be burned with fire then shall israel be heir unto
them that were his heirs saith the lord
howl o heshbon for ai is spoiled cry ye daughters of rabbah
gird you with sackcloth lament and run to and fro by the hedges for
their king shall go into captivity and his priests and his princes
together
wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys thy flowing valley o
backsliding daughter that trusted in her treasures saying who shall
come unto me   behold i will bring a fear upon thee saith the
lord god of hosts from all those that be about thee and ye shall be
driven out every man right forth and none shall gather up him that
wandereth
and afterward i will bring again the captivity of the children of
ammon saith the lord
concerning edom thus saith the lord of hosts is wisdom no more
in teman is counsel perished from the prudent is their wisdom
vanished   flee ye turn back dwell deep o inhabitants of
dedan for i will bring the calamity of esau upon him the time that i
will visit him
if grapegatherers come to thee would they not leave some
gleaning grapes if thieves by night they will destroy till they have
enough
but i have made esau bare i have uncovered his secret places
and he shall not be able to hide himself his seed is spoiled and his
brethren and his neighbours and he is not
leave thy fatherless children i will preserve them alive and
let thy widows trust in me
for thus saith the lord behold they whose judgment was not to
drink of the cup have assuredly drunken and art thou he that shall
altogether go unpunished thou shalt not go unpunished but thou shalt
surely drink of it
for i have sworn by myself saith the lord that bozrah shall
become a desolation a reproach a waste and a curse and all the
cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes
i have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sent
unto the heathen saying gather ye together and come against her
and rise up to the battle
for lo i will make thee small among the heathen and despised
among men
thy terribleness hath deceived thee and the pride of thine
heart o thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock that holdest
the height of the hill though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as
the eagle i will bring thee down from thence saith the lord
also edom shall be a desolation every one that goeth by it
shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof
as in the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour
cities thereof saith the lord no man shall abide there neither
shall a son of man dwell in it
behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of jordan
against the habitation of the strong but i will suddenly make him run
away from her and who is a chosen man that i may appoint over her
for who is like me and who will appoint me the time and who is that
shepherd that will stand before me   therefore hear the counsel
of the lord that he hath taken against edom and his purposes that
he hath purposed against the inhabitants of teman surely the least of
the flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their habitations
desolate with them
the earth is moved at the noise of their fall at the cry the
noise thereof was heard in the red sea
behold he shall come up and fly as the eagle and spread his
wings over bozrah and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men
of edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs
concerning damascus hamath is confounded and arpad for they
have heard evil tidings they are fainthearted there is sorrow on the
sea it cannot be quiet
damascus is waxed feeble and turneth herself to flee and fear
hath seized on her anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in
travail
how is the city of praise not left the city of my joy
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets and all the men of
war shall be cut off in that day saith the lord of hosts
and i will kindle a fire in the wall of damascus and it shall
consume the palaces of benhadad
concerning kedar and concerning the kingdoms of hazor which
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon shall smite thus saith the lord arise
ye go up to kedar and spoil the men of the east
their tents and their flocks shall they take away they shall
take to themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their
camels and they shall cry unto them fear is on every side
flee get you far off dwell deep o ye inhabitants of hazor
saith the lord for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath taken counsel
against you and hath conceived a purpose against you
arise get you up unto the wealthy nation that dwelleth without
care saith the lord which have neither gates nor bars which dwell
alone
and their camels shall be a booty and the multitude of their
cattle a spoil and i will scatter into all winds them that are in the
utmost corners and i will bring their calamity from all sides
thereof saith the lord
and hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons and a desolation for
ever there shall no man abide there nor any son of man dwell in it
the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against
elam in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah saying
thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will break the bow of
elam the chief of their might
and upon elam will i bring the four winds from the four quarters
of heaven and will scatter them toward all those winds and there
shall be no nation whither the outcasts of elam shall not come
for i will cause elam to be dismayed before their enemies and
before them that seek their life and i will bring evil upon them
even my fierce anger saith the lord and i will send the sword after
them till i have consumed them  and i will set my throne in
elam and will destroy from thence the king and the princes saith the
lord
but it shall come to pass in the latter days that i will bring
again the captivity of elam saith the lord
the word that the lord spake against babylon and against the land
of the chaldeans by jeremiah the prophet
declare ye among the nations and publish and set up a standard
publish and conceal not say babylon is taken bel is confounded
merodach is broken in pieces her idols are confounded her images are
broken in pieces
for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her which
shall make her land desolate and none shall dwell therein they shall
remove they shall depart both man and beast
in those days and in that time saith the lord the children of
israel shall come they and the children of judah together going and
weeping they shall go and seek the lord their god
they shall ask the way to zion with their faces thitherward
saying come and let us join ourselves to the lord in a perpetual
covenant that shall not be forgotten
my people hath been lost sheep their shepherds have caused them
to go astray they have turned them away on the mountains they have
gone from mountain to hill they have forgotten their restingplace
all that found them have devoured them and their adversaries
said we offend not because they have sinned against the lord the
habitation of justice even the lord the hope of their fathers
remove out of the midst of babylon and go forth out of the land
of the chaldeans and be as the he goats before the flocks
for lo i will raise and cause to come up against babylon an
assembly of great nations from the north country and they shall set
themselves in array against her from thence she shall be taken their
arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man none shall return in vain
and chaldea shall be a spoil all that spoil her shall be
satisfied saith the lord
because ye were glad because ye rejoiced o ye destroyers of
mine heritage because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass and
bellow as bulls  your mother shall be sore confounded she that
bare you shall be ashamed behold the hindermost of the nations shall
be a wilderness a dry land and a desert
because of the wrath of the lord it shall not be inhabited but
it shall be wholly desolate every one that goeth by babylon shall be
astonished and hiss at all her plagues
put yourselves in array against babylon round about all ye that
bend the bow shoot at her spare no arrows for she hath sinned
against the lord
shout against her round about she hath given her hand her
foundations are fallen her walls are thrown down for it is the
vengeance of the lord take vengeance upon her as she hath done do
unto her
cut off the sower from babylon and him that handleth the sickle
in the time of harvest for fear of the oppressing sword they shall
turn every one to his people and they shall flee every one to his own
land
israel is a scattered sheep the lions have driven him away
first the king of assyria hath devoured him and last this
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath broken his bones
therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel
behold i will punish the king of babylon and his land as i have
punished the king of assyria
and i will bring israel again to his habitation and he shall
feed on carmel and bashan and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount
ephraim and gilead
in those days and in that time saith the lord the iniquity of
israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of
judah and they shall not be found for i will pardon them whom i
reserve
go up against the land of merathaim even against it and
against the inhabitants of pekod waste and utterly destroy after
them saith the lord and do according to all that i have commanded
thee
a sound of battle is in the land and of great destruction
how is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken how
is babylon become a desolation among the nations   i have laid a
snare for thee and thou art also taken o babylon and thou wast not
aware thou art found and also caught because thou hast striven
against the lord
the lord hath opened his armoury and hath brought forth the
weapons of his indignation for this is the work of the lord god of
hosts in the land of the chaldeans
come against her from the utmost border open her storehouses
cast her up as heaps and destroy her utterly let nothing of her be
left
slay all her bullocks let them go down to the slaughter woe
unto them for their day is come the time of their visitation
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of
babylon to declare in zion the vengeance of the lord our god the
vengeance of his temple
call together the archers against babylon all ye that bend the
bow camp against it round about let none thereof escape recompense
her according to her work according to all that she hath done do
unto her for she hath been proud against the lord against the holy
one of israel
therefore shall her young men fall in the streets and all her
men of war shall be cut off in that day saith the lord
behold i am against thee o thou most proud saith the lord god
of hosts for thy day is come the time that i will visit thee
and the most proud shall stumble and fall and none shall raise
him up and i will kindle a fire in his cities and it shall devour
all round about him
thus saith the lord of hosts the children of israel and the
children of judah were oppressed together and all that took them
captives held them fast they refused to let them go
their redeemer is strong the lord of hosts is his name he
shall throughly plead their cause that he may give rest to the land
and disquiet the inhabitants of babylon
a sword is upon the chaldeans saith the lord and upon the
inhabitants of babylon and upon her princes and upon her wise men
a sword is upon the liars and they shall dote a sword is upon
her mighty men and they shall be dismayed
a sword is upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon
all the mingled people that are in the midst of her and they shall
become as women a sword is upon her treasures and they shall be
robbed
a drought is upon her waters and they shall be dried up for it
is the land of graven images and they are mad upon their idols
therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of
the islands shall dwell there and the owls shall dwell therein and
it shall be no more inhabited for ever neither shall it be dwelt in
from generation to generation
as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour cities
thereof saith the lord so shall no man abide there neither shall
any son of man dwell therein
behold a people shall come from the north and a great nation
and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth
they shall hold the bow and the lance they are cruel and will
not shew mercy their voice shall roar like the sea and they shall
ride upon horses every one put in array like a man to the battle
against thee o daughter of babylon
the king of babylon hath heard the report of them and his hands
waxed feeble anguish took hold of him and pangs as of a woman in
travail
behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of jordan
unto the habitation of the strong but i will make them suddenly run
away from her and who is a chosen man that i may appoint over her
for who is like me and who will appoint me the time and who is that
shepherd that will stand before me   therefore hear ye the
counsel of the lord that he hath taken against babylon and his
purposes that he hath purposed against the land of the chaldeans
surely the least of the flock shall draw them out surely he shall
make their habitation desolate with them
at the noise of the taking of babylon the earth is moved and
the cry is heard among the nations
thus saith the lord behold i will raise up against babylon and
against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me
a destroying wind  and will send unto babylon fanners that shall
fan her and shall empty her land for in the day of trouble they
shall be against her round about
against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow and against
him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine and spare ye not her
young men destroy ye utterly all her host
thus the slain shall fall in the land of the chaldeans and they
that are thrust through in her streets
for israel hath not been forsaken nor judah of his god of the
lord of hosts though their land was filled with sin against the holy
one of israel
flee out of the midst of babylon and deliver every man his soul
be not cut off in her iniquity for this is the time of the lords
vengeance he will render unto her a recompence
babylon hath been a golden cup in the lords hand that made all
the earth drunken the nations have drunken of her wine therefore the
nations are mad
babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed howl for her take balm
for her pain if so be she may be healed
we would have healed babylon but she is not healed forsake her
and let us go every one into his own country for her judgment
reacheth unto heaven and is lifted up even to the skies
the lord hath brought forth our righteousness come and let us
declare in zion the work of the lord our god
make bright the arrows gather the shields the lord hath raised
up the spirit of the kings of the medes for his device is against
babylon to destroy it because it is the vengeance of the lord the
vengeance of his temple
set up the standard upon the walls of babylon make the watch
strong set up the watchmen prepare the ambushes for the lord hath
both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of
babylon
o thou that dwellest upon many waters abundant in treasures
thine end is come and the measure of thy covetousness
the lord of hosts hath sworn by himself saying surely i will
fill thee with men as with caterpillers and they shall lift up a
shout against thee
he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the
world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heaven by his
understanding
when he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in
the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the
earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out
of his treasures
every man is brutish by his knowledge every founder is
confounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood and
there is no breath in them
they are vanity the work of errors in the time of their
visitation they shall perish
the portion of jacob is not like them for he is the former of
all things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord of
hosts is his name
thou art my battle axe and weapons of war for with thee will i
break in pieces the nations and with thee will i destroy kingdoms
and with thee will i break in pieces the horse and his rider
and with thee will i break in pieces the chariot and his rider
with thee also will i break in pieces man and woman and with thee
will i break in pieces old and young and with thee will i break in
pieces the young man and the maid  i will also break in pieces
with thee the shepherd and his flock and with thee will i break in
pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen and with thee will i break
in pieces captains and rulers
and i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabitants of
chaldea all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight
saith the lord
behold i am against thee o destroying mountain saith the
lord which destroyest all the earth and i will stretch out mine hand
upon thee and roll thee down from the rocks and will make thee a
burnt mountain
and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner nor a
stone for foundations but thou shalt be desolate for ever saith the
lord
set ye up a standard in the land blow the trumpet among the
nations prepare the nations against her call together against her
the kingdoms of ararat minni and ashchenaz appoint a captain
against her cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers
prepare against her the nations with the kings of the medes the
captains thereof and all the rulers thereof and all the land of his
dominion
and the land shall tremble and sorrow for every purpose of the
lord shall be performed against babylon to make the land of babylon a
desolation without an inhabitant
the mighty men of babylon have forborn to fight they have
remained in their holds their might hath failed they became as
women they have burned her dwellingplaces her bars are broken
one post shall run to meet another and one messenger to meet
another to shew the king of babylon that his city is taken at one
end  and that the passages are stopped and the reeds they have
burned with fire and the men of war are affrighted
for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel the
daughter of babylon is like a threshingfloor it is time to thresh
her yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come
nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon hath devoured me he hath
crushed me he hath made me an empty vessel he hath swallowed me up
like a dragon he hath filled his belly with my delicates he hath
cast me out
the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon babylon shall
the inhabitant of zion say and my blood upon the inhabitants of
chaldea shall jerusalem say
therefore thus saith the lord behold i will plead thy cause
and take vengeance for thee and i will dry up her sea and make her
springs dry
and babylon shall become heaps a dwellingplace for dragons an
astonishment and an hissing without an inhabitant
they shall roar together like lions they shall yell as lions
whelps
in their heat i will make their feasts and i will make them
drunken that they may rejoice and sleep a perpetual sleep and not
wake saith the lord
i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter like rams
with he goats
how is sheshach taken and how is the praise of the whole earth
surprised how is babylon become an astonishment among the nations
the sea is come up upon babylon she is covered with the
multitude of the waves thereof
her cities are a desolation a dry land and a wilderness a
land wherein no man dwelleth neither doth any son of man pass
thereby
and i will punish bel in babylon and i will bring forth out of
his mouth that which he hath swallowed up and the nations shall not
flow together any more unto him yea the wall of babylon shall fall
my people go ye out of the midst of her and deliver ye every
man his soul from the fierce anger of the lord
and lest your heart faint and ye fear for the rumour that shall
be heard in the land a rumour shall both come one year and after
that in another year shall come a rumour and violence in the land
ruler against ruler
therefore behold the days come that i will do judgment upon
the graven images of babylon and her whole land shall be confounded
and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her
then the heaven and the earth and all that is therein shall
sing for babylon for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north
saith the lord
as babylon hath caused the slain of israel to fall so at
babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth
ye that have escaped the sword go away stand not still
remember the lord afar off and let jerusalem come into your mind
we are confounded because we have heard reproach shame hath
covered our faces for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the
lords house
wherefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will do
judgment upon her graven images and through all her land the wounded
shall groan
though babylon should mount up to heaven and though she should
fortify the height of her strength yet from me shall spoilers come
unto her saith the lord
a sound of a cry cometh from babylon and great destruction from
the land of the chaldeans  because the lord hath spoiled
babylon and destroyed out of her the great voice when her waves do
roar like great waters a noise of their voice is uttered
because the spoiler is come upon her even upon babylon and her
mighty men are taken every one of their bows is broken for the lord
god of recompences shall surely requite
and i will make drunk her princes and her wise men her
captains and her rulers and her mighty men and they shall sleep a
perpetual sleep and not wake saith the king whose name is the lord
of hosts
thus saith the lord of hosts the broad walls of babylon shall
be utterly broken and her high gates shall be burned with fire and
the people shall labour in vain and the folk in the fire and they
shall be weary
the word which jeremiah the prophet commanded seraiah the son of
neriah the son of maaseiah when he went with zedekiah the king of
judah into babylon in the fourth year of his reign and this seraiah
was a quiet prince
so jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon
babylon even all these words that are written against babylon
and jeremiah said to seraiah when thou comest to babylon and
shalt see and shalt read all these words  then shalt thou say
o lord thou hast spoken against this place to cut it off that none
shall remain in it neither man nor beast but that it shall be
desolate for ever
and it shall be when thou hast made an end of reading this
book that thou shalt bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst
of euphrates  and thou shalt say thus shall babylon sink and
shall not rise from the evil that i will bring upon her and they
shall be weary thus far are the words of jeremiah
zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and
he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was
hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah
and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the lord according
to all that jehoiakim had done
for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem
and judah till he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiah
rebelled against the king of babylon
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth
month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadrezzar king of
babylon came he and all his army against jerusalem and pitched
against it and built forts against it round about
so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah
and in the fourth month in the ninth day of the month the
famine was sore in the city so that there was no bread for the people
of the land
then the city was broken up and all the men of war fled and
went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the
two walls which was by the kings garden now the chaldeans were by
the city round about and they went by the way of the plain
but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king and
overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and all his army was
scattered from him
then they took the king and carried him up unto the king of
babylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he gave judgment upon
him
and the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before his
eyes he slew also all the princes of judah in riblah
then he put out the eyes of zedekiah and the king of babylon
bound him in chains and carried him to babylon and put him in prison
till the day of his death
now in the fifth month in the tenth day of the month which was
the nineteenth year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came
nebuzaradan captain of the guard which served the king of babylon
into jerusalem  and burned the house of the lord and the kings
house and all the houses of jerusalem and all the houses of the
great men burned he with fire  and all the army of the
chaldeans that were with the captain of the guard brake down all the
walls of jerusalem round about
then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
certain of the poor of the people and the residue of the people that
remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to the king
of babylon and the rest of the multitude
but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the
poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen
also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lord
and the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the lord
the chaldeans brake and carried all the brass of them to babylon
the caldrons also and the shovels and the snuffers and the
bowls and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith they
ministered took they away
and the basons and the firepans and the bowls and the
caldrons and the candlesticks and the spoons and the cups that
which was of gold in gold and that which was of silver in silver
took the captain of the guard away
the two pillars one sea and twelve brasen bulls that were
under the bases which king solomon had made in the house of the lord
the brass of all these vessels was without weight
and concerning the pillars the height of one pillar was
eighteen cubits and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it and the
thickness thereof was four fingers it was hollow
and a chapiter of brass was upon it and the height of one
chapiter was five cubits with network and pomegranates upon the
chapiters round about all of brass the second pillar also and the
pomegranates were like unto these
and there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side and all
the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about
and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and
zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door
he took also out of the city an eunuch which had the charge of the
men of war and seven men of them that were near the kings person
which were found in the city and the principal scribe of the host
who mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people
of the land that were found in the midst of the city
so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought
them to the king of babylon to riblah
and the king of babylon smote them and put them to death in
riblah in the land of hamath thus judah was carried away captive out
of his own land
this is the people whom nebuchadrezzar carried away captive in
the seventh year three thousand jews and three and twenty  in
the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from
jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons  in the three and
twentieth year of nebuchadrezzar nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
carried away captive of the jews seven hundred forty and five persons
all the persons were four thousand and six hundred
and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month in the
five and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon
in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of jehoiachin king
of judah and brought him forth out of prison
and spake kindly unto him and set his throne above the throne
of the kings that were with him in babylon  and changed his
prison garments and he did continually eat bread before him all the
days of his life
and for his diet there was a continual diet given him of the
king of babylon every day a portion until the day of his death all
the days of his life
the lamentations of jeremiah
how doth the city sit solitary that was full of people how is
she become as a widow she that was great among the nations and
princess among the provinces how is she become tributary   she
weepeth sore in the night and her tears are on her cheeks among all
her lovers she hath none to comfort her all her friends have dealt
treacherously with her they are become her enemies
judah is gone into captivity because of affliction and because of
great servitude she dwelleth among the heathen she findeth no rest
all her persecutors overtook her between the straits
the ways of zion do mourn because none come to the solemn feasts
all her gates are desolate her priests sigh her virgins are
afflicted and she is in bitterness
her adversaries are the chief her enemies prosper for the lord
hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions her
children are gone into captivity before the enemy
and from the daughter of zion all her beauty is departed her
princes are become like harts that find no pasture and they are gone
without strength before the pursuer
jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her
miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old when
her people fell into the hand of the enemy and none did help her the
adversaries saw her and did mock at her sabbaths
jerusalem hath grievously sinned therefore she is removed all
that honoured her despise her because they have seen her nakedness
yea she sigheth and turneth backward
her filthiness is in her skirts she remembereth not her last end
therefore she came down wonderfully she had no comforter o lord
behold my affliction for the enemy hath magnified himself
the adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant
things for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary
whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy
congregation
all her people sigh they seek bread they have given their
pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul see o lord and
consider for i am become vile
is it nothing to you all ye that pass by behold and see if
there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow which is done unto me
wherewith the lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger
from above hath he sent fire into my bones and it prevaileth
against them he hath spread a net for my feet he hath turned me
back he hath made me desolate and faint all the day
the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand they are
wreathed and come up upon my neck he hath made my strength to fall
the lord hath delivered me into their hands from whom i am not able
to rise up
the lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst
of me he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men
the lord hath trodden the virgin the daughter of judah as in a
winepress
for these things i weep mine eye mine eye runneth down with
water because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from
me my children are desolate because the enemy prevailed
zion spreadeth forth her hands and there is none to comfort her
the lord hath commanded concerning jacob that his adversaries should
be round about him jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them
the lord is righteous for i have rebelled against his
commandment hear i pray you all people and behold my sorrow my
virgins and my young men are gone into captivity
i called for my lovers but they deceived me my priests and mine
elders gave up the ghost in the city while they sought their meat to
relieve their souls
behold o lord for i am in distress my bowels are troubled
mine heart is turned within me for i have grievously rebelled abroad
the sword bereaveth at home there is as death
they have heard that i sigh there is none to comfort me all
mine enemies have heard of my trouble they are glad that thou hast
done it thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called and they shall
be like unto me
let all their wickedness come before thee and do unto them as
thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions for my sighs are
many and my heart is faint
how hath the lord covered the daughter of zion with a cloud in his
anger and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of israel
and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger   the
lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob and hath not
pitied he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the
daughter of judah he hath brought them down to the ground he hath
polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof
he hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of israel he
hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy and he burned
against jacob like a flaming fire which devoureth round about
he hath bent his bow like an enemy he stood with his right hand
as an adversary and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the
tabernacle of the daughter of zion he poured out his fury like fire
the lord was as an enemy he hath swallowed up israel he hath
swallowed up all her palaces he hath destroyed his strong holds and
hath increased in the daughter of judah mourning and lamentation
and he hath violently taken away his tabernacle as if it were of
a garden he hath destroyed his places of the assembly the lord hath
caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in zion and
hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest
the lord hath cast off his altar he hath abhorred his sanctuary
he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces
they have made a noise in the house of the lord as in the day of a
solemn feast
the lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of
zion he hath stretched out a line he hath not withdrawn his hand
from destroying therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament
they languished together
her gates are sunk into the ground he hath destroyed and broken
her bars her king and her princes are among the gentiles the law is
no more her prophets also find no vision from the lord
the elders of the daughter of zion sit upon the ground and keep
silence they have cast up dust upon their heads they have girded
themselves with sackcloth the virgins of jerusalem hang down their
heads to the ground
mine eyes do fail with tears my bowels are troubled my liver is
poured upon the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my
people because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of
the city
they say to their mothers where is corn and wine when they
swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city when their soul was
poured out into their mothers bosom
what thing shall i take to witness for thee what thing shall i
liken to thee o daughter of jerusalem what shall i equal to thee
that i may comfort thee o virgin daughter of zion for thy breach is
great like the sea who can heal thee   thy prophets have seen
vain and foolish things for thee and they have not discovered thine
iniquity to turn away thy captivity but have seen for thee false
burdens and causes of banishment
all that pass by clap their hands at thee they hiss and wag
their head at the daughter of jerusalem saying is this the city that
men call the perfection of beauty the joy of the whole earth
all thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee they hiss and
gnash the teeth they say we have swallowed her up certainly this is
the day that we looked for we have found we have seen it
the lord hath done that which he had devised he hath fulfilled
his word that he had commanded in the days of old he hath thrown
down and hath not pitied and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice
over thee he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries
their heart cried unto the lord o wall of the daughter of zion
let tears run down like a river day and night give thyself no rest
let not the apple of thine eye cease
arise cry out in the night in the beginning of the watches pour
out thine heart like water before the face of the lord lift up thy
hands toward him for the life of thy young children that faint for
hunger in the top of every street
behold o lord and consider to whom thou hast done this shall
the women eat their fruit and children of a span long shall the
priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the lord
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets my virgins and
my young men are fallen by the sword thou hast slain them in the day
of thine anger thou hast killed and not pitied
thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about so
that in the day of the lords anger none escaped nor remained those
that i have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed
i am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath
he hath led me and brought me into darkness but not into light
surely against me is he turned he turneth his hand against me all
the day
my flesh and my skin hath he made old he hath broken my bones
he hath builded against me and compassed me with gall and
travail
he hath set me in dark places as they that be dead of old
he hath hedged me about that i cannot get out he hath made my
chain heavy
also when i cry and shout he shutteth out my prayer
he hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone he hath made my paths
crooked
he was unto me as a bear lying in wait and as a lion in secret
places
he hath turned aside my ways and pulled me in pieces he hath
made me desolate
he hath bent his bow and set me as a mark for the arrow
he hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins
i was a derision to all my people and their song all the day
he hath filled me with bitterness he hath made me drunken with
wormwood
he hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones he hath covered
me with ashes
and thou hast removed my soul far off from peace i forgat
prosperity
and i said my strength and my hope is perished from the lord
remembering mine affliction and my misery the wormwood and the
gall
my soul hath them still in remembrance and is humbled in me
this i recall to my mind therefore have i hope
it is of the lords mercies that we are not consumed because his
compassions fail not
they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness
the lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will i hope in
him
the lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that
seeketh him
it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
salvation of the lord
it is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth
he sitteth alone and keepeth silence because he hath borne it
upon him
he putteth his mouth in the dust if so be there may be hope
he giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him he is filled full
with reproach
for the lord will not cast off for ever  but though he cause
grief yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his
mercies
for he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men
to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth
to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most
high  to subvert a man in his cause the lord approveth not
who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the lord
commandeth it not   out of the mouth of the most high proceedeth
not evil and good   wherefore doth a living man complain a man
for the punishment of his sins   let us search and try our ways
and turn again to the lord
let us lift up our heart with our hands unto god in the heavens
we have transgressed and have rebelled thou hast not pardoned
thou hast covered with anger and persecuted us thou hast slain
thou hast not pitied
thou hast covered thyself with a cloud that our prayer should
not pass through
thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of
the people
all our enemies have opened their mouths against us
fear and a snare is come upon us desolation and destruction
mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of
the daughter of my people
mine eye trickleth down and ceaseth not without any
intermission
till the lord look down and behold from heaven
mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my
city
mine enemies chased me sore like a bird without cause
they have cut off my life in the dungeon and cast a stone upon
me
waters flowed over mine head then i said i am cut off
i called upon thy name o lord out of the low dungeon
thou hast heard my voice hide not thine ear at my breathing at
my cry
thou drewest near in the day that i called upon thee thou
saidst fear not
o lord thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul thou hast
redeemed my life
o lord thou hast seen my wrong judge thou my cause
thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations
against me
thou hast heard their reproach o lord and all their
imaginations against me  the lips of those that rose up against
me and their device against me all the day
behold their sitting down and their rising up i am their
musick
render unto them a recompence o lord according to the work of
their hands
give them sorrow of heart thy curse unto them
persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the
lord
how is the gold become dim how is the most fine gold changed the
stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street
the precious sons of zion comparable to fine gold how are they
esteemed as earthen pitchers the work of the hands of the potter
even the sea monsters draw out the breast they give suck to their
young ones the daughter of my people is become cruel like the
ostriches in the wilderness
the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth
for thirst the young children ask bread and no man breaketh it unto
them
they that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets they
that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills
for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is
greater than the punishment of the sin of sodom that was overthrown
as in a moment and no hands stayed on her
her nazarites were purer than snow they were whiter than milk
they were more ruddy in body than rubies their polishing was of
sapphire  their visage is blacker than a coal they are not known
in the streets their skin cleaveth to their bones it is withered it
is become like a stick
they that be slain with the sword are better than they that be
slain with hunger for these pine away stricken through for want of
the fruits of the field
the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children
they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people
the lord hath accomplished his fury he hath poured out his
fierce anger and hath kindled a fire in zion and it hath devoured
the foundations thereof
the kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world
would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have
entered into the gates of jerusalem
for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests
that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her  they
have wandered as blind men in the streets they have polluted
themselves with blood so that men could not touch their garments
they cried unto them depart ye it is unclean depart depart
touch not when they fled away and wandered they said among the
heathen they shall no more sojourn there
the anger of the lord hath divided them he will no more regard
them they respected not the persons of the priests they favoured not
the elders
as for us our eyes as yet failed for our vain help in our
watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us
they hunt our steps that we cannot go in our streets our end is
near our days are fulfilled for our end is come
our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven they
pursued us upon the mountains they laid wait for us in the
wilderness
the breath of our nostrils the anointed of the lord was taken
in their pits of whom we said under his shadow we shall live among
the heathen
rejoice and be glad o daughter of edom that dwellest in the
land of uz the cup also shall pass through unto thee thou shalt be
drunken and shalt make thyself naked
the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished o daughter of
zion he will no more carry thee away into captivity he will visit
thine iniquity o daughter of edom he will discover thy sins
remember o lord what is come upon us consider and behold our
reproach
our inheritance is turned to strangers our houses to aliens
we are orphans and fatherless our mothers are as widows
we have drunken our water for money our wood is sold unto us
our necks are under persecution we labour and have no rest
we have given the hand to the egyptians and to the assyrians to
be satisfied with bread
our fathers have sinned and are not and we have borne their
iniquities
servants have ruled over us there is none that doth deliver us
out of their hand
we gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword
of the wilderness
our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine
they ravished the women in zion and the maids in the cities of
judah
princes are hanged up by their hand the faces of elders were not
honoured
they took the young men to grind and the children fell under the
wood
the elders have ceased from the gate the young men from their
musick
the joy of our heart is ceased our dance is turned into
mourning
the crown is fallen from our head woe unto us that we have
sinned   for this our heart is faint for these things our eyes
are dim
because of the mountain of zion which is desolate the foxes
walk upon it
thou o lord remainest for ever thy throne from generation to
generation
wherefore dost thou forget us for ever and forsake us so long
time   turn thou us unto thee o lord and we shall be turned
renew our days as of old
but thou hast utterly rejected us thou art very wroth against us
the book of the prophet ezekiel
now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth month
in the fifth day of the month as i was among the captives by the river
of chebar that the heavens were opened and i saw visions of god
in the fifth day of the month which was the fifth year of king
jehoiachins captivity  the word of the lord came expressly unto
ezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the chaldeans by
the river chebar and the hand of the lord was there upon him
and i looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a
great cloud and a fire infolding itself and a brightness was about
it and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber out of the
midst of the fire
also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a
man
and every one had four faces and every one had four wings
and their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was
like the sole of a calfs foot and they sparkled like the colour of
burnished brass
and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four
sides and they four had their faces and their wings
their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they
went they went every one straight forward
as for the likeness of their faces they four had the face of a
man and the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the
face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an
eagle
thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two
wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their
bodies
and they went every one straight forward whither the spirit was
to go they went and they turned not when they went
as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was
like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps it went
up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and
out of the fire went forth lightning
and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a
flash of lightning
now as i beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the
earth by the living creatures with his four faces
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the
colour of a beryl and they four had one likeness and their
appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a
wheel
when they went they went upon their four sides and they turned
not when they went
as for their rings they were so high that they were dreadful
and their rings were full of eyes round about them four
and when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and
when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels
were lifted up
whithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was their
spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the
spirit of the living creature was in the wheels
when those went these went and when those stood these stood
and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted
up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the
wheels
and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched forth
over their heads above
and under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward
the other every one had two which covered on this side and every
one had two which covered on that side their bodies
and when they went i heard the noise of their wings like the
noise of great waters as the voice of the almighty the voice of
speech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down their
wings
and there was a voice from the firmament that was over their
heads when they stood and had let down their wings
and above the firmament that was over their heads was the
likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon
the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man
above upon it
and i saw as the colour of amber as the appearance of fire round
about within it from the appearance of his loins even upward and
from the appearance of his loins even downward i saw as it were the
appearance of fire and it had brightness round about
as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of
rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about this was
the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord and when i
saw it i fell upon my face and i heard a voice of one that spake
and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will
speak unto thee
and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me
upon my feet that i heard him that spake unto me
and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children of
israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and
their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day
for they are impudent children and stiffhearted i do send thee
unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god
and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear
for they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there hath been
a prophet among them
and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of
their words though briers and thorns be with thee and thou dost
dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed
at their looks though they be a rebellious house
and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear
or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious
but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thou
rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that i
give thee
and when i looked behold an hand was sent unto me and lo a
roll of a book was therein  and he spread it before me and it
was written within and without and there was written therein
lamentations and mourning and woe
moreover he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest eat
this roll and go speak unto the house of israel
so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll
and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill
thy bowels with this roll that i give thee then did i eat it and it
was in my mouth as honey for sweetness
and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of
israel and speak with my words unto them
for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an
hard language but to the house of israel  not to many people of a
strange speech and of an hard language whose words thou canst not
understand surely had i sent thee to them they would have hearkened
unto thee
but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee for they will
not hearken unto me for all the house of israel are impudent and
hardhearted
behold i have made thy face strong against their faces and thy
forehead strong against their foreheads
as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead fear
them not neither be dismayed at their looks though they be a
rebellious house
moreover he said unto me son of man all my words that i shall
speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine ears
and go get thee to them of the captivity unto the children of
thy people and speak unto them and tell them thus saith the lord
god whether they will hear or whether they will forbear
then the spirit took me up and i heard behind me a voice of a
great rushing saying blessed be the glory of the lord from his
place
i heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that
touched one another and the noise of the wheels over against them
and a noise of a great rushing
so the spirit lifted me up and took me away and i went in
bitterness in the heat of my spirit but the hand of the lord was
strong upon me
then i came to them of the captivity at telabib that dwelt by
the river of chebar and i sat where they sat and remained there
astonished among them seven days
and it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of
the lord came unto me saying  son of man i have made thee a
watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at my
mouth and give them warning from me
when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou
givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his
wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his
iniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand
yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness
nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast
delivered thy soul
again when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and
commit iniquity and i lay a stumblingblock before him he shall die
because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and
his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered but his
blood will i require at thine hand
nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous
sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is
warned also thou hast delivered thy soul
and the hand of the lord was there upon me and he said unto me
arise go forth into the plain and i will there talk with thee
then i arose and went forth into the plain and behold the
glory of the lord stood there as the glory which i saw by the river
of chebar and i fell on my face
then the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet and
spake with me and said unto me go shut thyself within thine house
but thou o son of man behold they shall put bands upon thee
and shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go out among them
and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that
thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover for they are
a rebellious house
but when i speak with thee i will open thy mouth and thou shalt
say unto them thus saith the lord god he that heareth let him hear
and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a rebellious
house
thou also son of man take thee a tile and lay it before thee
and pourtray upon it the city even jerusalem  and lay siege
against it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against it
set the camp also against it and set battering rams against it round
about
moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of
iron between thee and the city and set thy face against it and it
shall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it this shall be
a sign to the house of israel
lie thou also upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the
house of israel upon it according to the number of the days that thou
shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity
for i have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according
to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days so shalt
thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel
and when thou hast accomplished them lie again on thy right side
and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty days i
have appointed thee each day for a year
therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem
and thine arm shall be uncovered and thou shalt prophesy against it
and behold i will lay bands upon thee and thou shalt not turn
thee from one side to another till thou hast ended the days of thy
siege
take thou also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and
lentiles and millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and
make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou
shalt lie upon thy side three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat
thereof
and thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenty
shekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat it
thou shalt drink also water by measure the sixth part of an hin
from time to time shalt thou drink
and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it
with dung that cometh out of man in their sight
and the lord said even thus shall the children of israel eat
their defiled bread among the gentiles whither i will drive them
then said i ah lord god behold my soul hath not been polluted
for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which
dieth of itself or is torn in pieces neither came there abominable
flesh into my mouth
then he said unto me lo i have given thee cows dung for mans
dung and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith
moreover he said unto me son of man behold i will break the
staff of bread in jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and
with care and they shall drink water by measure and with
astonishment  that they may want bread and water and be astonied
one with another and consume away for their iniquity
and thou son of man take thee a sharp knife take thee a
barbers razor and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy
beard then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair
thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city
when the days of the siege are fulfilled and thou shalt take a third
part and smite about it with a knife and a third part thou shalt
scatter in the wind and i will draw out a sword after them
thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thy
skirts
then take of them again and cast them into the midst of the fire
and burn them in the fire for thereof shall a fire come forth into
all the house of israel
thus saith the lord god this is jerusalem i have set it in the
midst of the nations and countries that are round about her
and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the
nations and my statutes more than the countries that are round about
her for they have refused my judgments and my statutes they have not
walked in them
therefore thus saith the lord god because ye multiplied more than
the nations that are round about you and have not walked in my
statutes neither have kept my judgments neither have done according
to the judgments of the nations that are round about you
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i even i am against thee
and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the
nations
and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto i
will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee
and the sons shall eat their fathers and i will execute judgments in
thee and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter into all the winds
wherefore as i live saith the lord god surely because thou
hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all
thine abominations therefore will i also diminish thee neither shall
mine eye spare neither will i have any pity
a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and with
famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee and a third part
shall fall by the sword round about thee and i will scatter a third
part into all the winds and i will draw out a sword after them
thus shall mine anger be accomplished and i will cause my fury
to rest upon them and i will be comforted and they shall know that i
the lord have spoken it in my zeal when i have accomplished my fury
in them
moreover i will make thee waste and a reproach among the nations
that are round about thee in the sight of all that pass by
so it shall be a reproach and a taunt an instruction and an
astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee when i shall
execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes
i the lord have spoken it
when i shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine which
shall be for their destruction and which i will send to destroy you
and i will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of
bread  so will i send upon you famine and evil beasts and they
shall bereave thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee
and i will bring the sword upon thee i the lord have spoken it
and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man set
thy face toward the mountains of israel and prophesy against them
and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god
thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the
rivers and to the valleys behold i even i will bring a sword upon
you and i will destroy your high places
and your altars shall be desolate and your images shall be
broken and i will cast down your slain men before your idols
and i will lay the dead carcases of the children of israel before
their idols and i will scatter your bones round about your altars
in all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste and the
high places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste and
made desolate and your idols may be broken and cease and your images
may be cut down and your works may be abolished
and the slain shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall know
that i am the lord
yet will i leave a remnant that ye may have some that shall
escape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered through
the countries
and they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations
whither they shall be carried captives because i am broken with their
whorish heart which hath departed from me and with their eyes which
go a whoring after their idols and they shall lothe themselves for
the evils which they have committed in all their abominations
and they shall know that i am the lord and that i have not said
in vain that i would do this evil unto them
thus saith the lord god smite with thine hand and stamp with
thy foot and say alas for all the evil abominations of the house of
israel for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by the
pestilence
he that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is
near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged
shall die by the famine thus will i accomplish my fury upon them
then shall ye know that i am the lord when their slain men shall
be among their idols round about their altars upon every high hill
in all the tops of the mountains and under every green tree and
under every thick oak the place where they did offer sweet savour to
all their idols
so will i stretch out my hand upon them and make the land
desolate yea more desolate than the wilderness toward diblath in
all their habitations and they shall know that i am the lord
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  also thou
son of man thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel an end
the end is come upon the four corners of the land
now is the end come upon thee and i will send mine anger upon
thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense
upon thee all thine abominations
and mine eye shall not spare thee neither will i have pity but i
will recompense thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in
the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord
thus saith the lord god an evil an only evil behold is come
an end is come the end is come it watcheth for thee behold it
is come
the morning is come unto thee o thou that dwellest in the land
the time is come the day of trouble is near and not the sounding
again of the mountains
now will i shortly pour out my fury upon thee and accomplish mine
anger upon thee and i will judge thee according to thy ways and will
recompense thee for all thine abominations
and mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity i will
recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are
in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord that
smiteth
behold the day behold it is come the morning is gone forth
the rod hath blossomed pride hath budded
violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness none of them shall
remain nor of their multitude nor of any of theirs neither shall
there be wailing for them
the time is come the day draweth near let not the buyer
rejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the multitude
thereof
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold although
they were yet alive for the vision is touching the whole multitude
thereof which shall not return neither shall any strengthen himself
in the iniquity of his life
they have blown the trumpet even to make all ready but none
goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof
the sword is without and the pestilence and the famine within
he that is in the field shall die with the sword and he that is in
the city famine and pestilence shall devour him
but they that escape of them shall escape and shall be on the
mountains like doves of the valleys all of them mourning every one
for his iniquity
all hands shall be feeble and all knees shall be weak as water
they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth and horror shall
cover them and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon all
their heads
they shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold shall
be removed their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver
them in the day of the wrath of the lord they shall not satisfy their
souls neither fill their bowels because it is the stumblingblock of
their iniquity
as for the beauty of his ornament he set it in majesty but they
made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things
therein therefore have i set it far from them
and i will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey
and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil and they shall pollute it
my face will i turn also from them and they shall pollute my
secret place for the robbers shall enter into it and defile it
make a chain for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city
is full of violence
wherefore i will bring the worst of the heathen and they shall
possess their houses i will also make the pomp of the strong to
cease and their holy places shall be defiled
destruction cometh and they shall seek peace and there shall be
none
mischief shall come upon mischief and rumour shall be upon
rumour then shall they seek a vision of the prophet but the law
shall perish from the priest and counsel from the ancients
the king shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed with
desolation and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled
i will do unto them after their way and according to their deserts
will i judge them and they shall know that i am the lord
and it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in the
fifth day of the month as i sat in mine house and the elders of
judah sat before me that the hand of the lord god fell there upon me
then i beheld and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire from
the appearance of his loins even downward fire and from his loins
even upward as the appearance of brightness as the colour of amber
and he put forth the form of an hand and took me by a lock of
mine head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the
heaven and brought me in the visions of god to jerusalem to the door
of the inner gate that looketh toward the north where was the seat of
the image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousy
and behold the glory of the god of israel was there according
to the vision that i saw in the plain
then said he unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now the way
toward the north so i lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north
and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy
in the entry
he said furthermore unto me son of man seest thou what they do
even the great abominations that the house of israel committeth here
that i should go far off from my sanctuary but turn thee yet again
and thou shalt see greater abominations
and he brought me to the door of the court and when i looked
behold a hole in the wall
then said he unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when i
had digged in the wall behold a door
and he said unto me go in and behold the wicked abominations
that they do here
so i went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things
and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of israel
pourtrayed upon the wall round about
and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the
house of israel and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son of
shaphan with every man his censer in his hand and a thick cloud of
incense went up
then said he unto me son of man hast thou seen what the
ancients of the house of israel do in the dark every man in the
chambers of his imagery for they say the lord seeth us not the lord
hath forsaken the earth
he said also unto me turn thee yet again and thou shalt see
greater abominations that they do
then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lords house
which was toward the north and behold there sat women weeping for
tammuz
then said he unto me hast thou seen this o son of man turn
thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations than these
and he brought me into the inner court of the lords house and
behold at the door of the temple of the lord between the porch and
the altar were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the
temple of the lord and their faces toward the east and they
worshipped the sun toward the east
then he said unto me hast thou seen this o son of man is it a
light thing to the house of judah that they commit the abominations
which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence
and have returned to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branch
to their nose
therefore will i also deal in fury mine eye shall not spare
neither will i have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud
voice yet will i not hear them
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause them
that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his
destroying weapon in his hand
and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which
lieth toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand
and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writers inkhorn
by his side and they went in and stood beside the brasen altar
and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub
whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the
man clothed with linen which had the writers inkhorn by his side
and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city
through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of
the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done
in the midst thereof
and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through
the city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity
slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and
women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at
my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the
house
and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with
the slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city
and it came to pass while they were slaying them and i was left
that i fell upon my face and cried and said ah lord god wilt thou
destroy all the residue of israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon
jerusalem   then said he unto me the iniquity of the house of
israel and judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood
and the city full of perverseness for they say the lord hath
forsaken the earth and the lord seeth not
and as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will i have
pity but i will recompense their way upon their head
and behold the man clothed with linen which had the inkhorn by
his side reported the matter saying i have done as thou hast
commanded me
then i looked and behold in the firmament that was above the
head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire
stone as the appearance of the likeness of a throne
and he spake unto the man clothed with linen and said go in
between the wheels even under the cherub and fill thine hand with
coals of fire from between the cherubims and scatter them over the
city and he went in in my sight
now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the
man went in and the cloud filled the inner court
then the glory of the lord went up from the cherub and stood
over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the
cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the lords glory
and the sound of the cherubims wings was heard even to the outer
court as the voice of the almighty god when he speaketh
and it came to pass that when he had commanded the man clothed
with linen saying take fire from between the wheels from between
the cherubims then he went in and stood beside the wheels
and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the
cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims and took
thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen
who took it and went out
and there appeared in the cherubims the form of a mans hand
under their wings
and when i looked behold the four wheels by the cherubims one
wheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub and the
appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone
and as for their appearances they four had one likeness as if
a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel
when they went they went upon their four sides they turned not
as they went but to the place whither the head looked they followed
it they turned not as they went
and their whole body and their backs and their hands and
their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even the
wheels that they four had
as for the wheels it was cried unto them in my hearing o
wheel
and every one had four faces the first face was the face of a
cherub and the second face was the face of a man and the third the
face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle
and the cherubims were lifted up this is the living creature
that i saw by the river of chebar
and when the cherubims went the wheels went by them and when
the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the
same wheels also turned not from beside them
when they stood these stood and when they were lifted up
these lifted up themselves also for the spirit of the living creature
was in them
then the glory of the lord departed from off the threshold of
the house and stood over the cherubims
and the cherubims lifted up their wings and mounted up from the
earth in my sight when they went out the wheels also were beside
them and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the lords
house and the glory of the god of israel was over them above
this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel
by the river of chebar and i knew that they were the cherubims
every one had four faces apiece and every one four wings and
the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings
and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which i saw
by the river of chebar their appearances and themselves they went
every one straight forward
moreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the east
gate of the lords house which looketh eastward and behold at the
door of the gate five and twenty men among whom i saw jaazaniah the
son of azur and pelatiah the son of benaiah princes of the people
then said he unto me son of man these are the men that devise
mischief and give wicked counsel in this city  which say it is
not near let us build houses this city is the caldron and we be the
flesh
therefore prophesy against them prophesy o son of man
and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said unto me speak
thus saith the lord thus have ye said o house of israel for i know
the things that come into your mind every one of them
ye have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filled
the streets thereof with the slain
therefore thus saith the lord god your slain whom ye have laid
in the midst of it they are the flesh and this city is the caldron
but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it
ye have feared the sword and i will bring a sword upon you
saith the lord god
and i will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliver you
into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you
ye shall fall by the sword i will judge you in the border of
israel and ye shall know that i am the lord
this city shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the
flesh in the midst thereof but i will judge you in the border of
israel  and ye shall know that i am the lord for ye have not
walked in my statutes neither executed my judgments but have done
after the manners of the heathen that are round about you
and it came to pass when i prophesied that pelatiah the son of
benaiah died then fell i down upon my face and cried with a loud
voice and said ah lord god wilt thou make a full end of the remnant
of israel   again the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man thy brethren even thy brethren the men of thy
kindred and all the house of israel wholly are they unto whom the
inhabitants of jerusalem have said get you far from the lord unto us
is this land given in possession
therefore say thus saith the lord god although i have cast
them far off among the heathen and although i have scattered them
among the countries yet will i be to them as a little sanctuary in
the countries where they shall come
therefore say thus saith the lord god i will even gather you
from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have
been scattered and i will give you the land of israel
and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the
detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from
thence
and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit
within you and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh and
will give them an heart of flesh  that they may walk in my
statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my
people and i will be their god
but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their
detestable things and their abominations i will recompense their way
upon their own heads saith the lord god
then did the cherubims lift up their wings and the wheels
beside them and the glory of the god of israel was over them above
and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the city
and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city
afterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by
the spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captivity so the
vision that i had seen went up from me
then i spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the
lord had shewed me
the word of the lord also came unto me saying  son of man
thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house which have eyes to
see and see not they have ears to hear and hear not for they are a
rebellious house
therefore thou son of man prepare thee stuff for removing and
remove by day in their sight and thou shalt remove from thy place to
another place in their sight it may be they will consider though
they be a rebellious house
then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight as
stuff for removing and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight as
they that go forth into captivity
dig thou through the wall in their sight and carry out thereby
in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders and carry
it forth in the twilight thou shalt cover thy face that thou see not
the ground for i have set thee for a sign unto the house of israel
and i did so as i was commanded i brought forth my stuff by day
as stuff for captivity and in the even i digged through the wall with
mine hand i brought it forth in the twilight and i bare it upon my
shoulder in their sight
and in the morning came the word of the lord unto me saying
son of man hath not the house of israel the rebellious house
said unto thee what doest thou   say thou unto them thus saith
the lord god this burden concerneth the prince in jerusalem and all
the house of israel that are among them
say i am your sign like as i have done so shall it be done
unto them they shall remove and go into captivity
and the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder
in the twilight and shall go forth they shall dig through the wall
to carry out thereby he shall cover his face that he see not the
ground with his eyes
my net also will i spread upon him and he shall be taken in my
snare and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeans
yet shall he not see it though he shall die there
and i will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to
help him and all his bands and i will draw out the sword after them
and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall scatter
them among the nations and disperse them in the countries
but i will leave a few men of them from the sword from the
famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their
abominations among the heathen whither they come and they shall know
that i am the lord
moreover the word of the lord came to me saying  son of
man eat thy bread with quaking and drink thy water with trembling
and with carefulness  and say unto the people of the land thus
saith the lord god of the inhabitants of jerusalem and of the land of
israel they shall eat their bread with carefulness and drink their
water with astonishment that her land may be desolate from all that
is therein because of the violence of all them that dwell therein
and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and the
land shall be desolate and ye shall know that i am the lord
and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
what is that proverb that ye have in the land of israel saying the
days are prolonged and every vision faileth   tell them
therefore thus saith the lord god i will make this proverb to cease
and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel but say unto
them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision
for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering
divination within the house of israel
for i am the lord i will speak and the word that i shall speak
shall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days o
rebellious house will i say the word and will perform it saith the
lord god
again the word of the lord came to me saying
son of man behold they of the house of israel say the vision
that he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesieth of the
times that are far off
therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god there shall
none of my words be prolonged any more but the word which i have
spoken shall be done saith the lord god
and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
prophesy against the prophets of israel that prophesy and say thou
unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts hear ye the word of
the lord  thus saith the lord god woe unto the foolish prophets
that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing   o israel
thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts
ye have not gone up into the gaps neither made up the hedge for
the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord
they have seen vanity and lying divination saying the lord
saith and the lord hath not sent them and they have made others to
hope that they would confirm the word
have ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lying
divination whereas ye say the lord saith it albeit i have not
spoken   therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have
spoken vanity and seen lies therefore behold i am against you
saith the lord god
and mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity and
that divine lies they shall not be in the assembly of my people
neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of israel
neither shall they enter into the land of israel and ye shall know
that i am the lord god
because even because they have seduced my people saying
peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo
others daubed it with untempered morter  say unto them which
daub it with untempered morter that it shall fall there shall be an
overflowing shower and ye o great hailstones shall fall and a
stormy wind shall rend it
lo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto you
where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it   therefore
thus saith the lord god i will even rend it with a stormy wind in my
fury and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger and
great hailstones in my fury to consume it
so will i break down the wall that ye have daubed with
untempered morter and bring it down to the ground so that the
foundation thereof shall be discovered and it shall fall and ye
shall be consumed in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i am
the lord
thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them
that have daubed it with untempered morter and will say unto you the
wall is no more neither they that daubed it  to wit the
prophets of israel which prophesy concerning jerusalem and which see
visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the lord god
likewise thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of
thy people which prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thou
against them  and say thus saith the lord god woe to the women
that sew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head of
every stature to hunt souls will ye hunt the souls of my people and
will ye save the souls alive that come unto you   and will ye
pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of
bread to slay the souls that should not die and to save the souls
alive that should not live by your lying to my people that hear your
lies   wherefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against
your pillows wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly and
i will tear them from your arms and will let the souls go even the
souls that ye hunt to make them fly
your kerchiefs also will i tear and deliver my people out of
your hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted and ye
shall know that i am the lord
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad
whom i have not made sad and strengthened the hands of the wicked
that he should not return from his wicked way by promising him life
therefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divinations
for i will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that
i am the lord
then came certain of the elders of israel unto me and sat before
me
and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the
stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face should i be
enquired of at all by them   therefore speak unto them and say
unto them thus saith the lord god every man of the house of israel
that setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock
of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet i the lord
will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols
that i may take the house of israel in their own heart because
they are all estranged from me through their idols
therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god
repent and turn yourselves from your idols and turn away your faces
from all your abominations
for every one of the house of israel or of the stranger that
sojourneth in israel which separateth himself from me and setteth up
his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity
before his face and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning
me i the lord will answer him by myself  and i will set my face
against that man and will make him a sign and a proverb and i will
cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that i am
the lord
and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing i the
lord have deceived that prophet and i will stretch out my hand upon
him and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel
and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity the
punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that
seeketh unto him  that the house of israel may go no more astray
from me neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions
but that they may be my people and i may be their god saith the lord
god
the word of the lord came again to me saying  son of man
when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously then will
i stretch out mine hand upon it and will break the staff of the bread
thereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and beast
from it  though these three men noah daniel and job were in
it they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness
saith the lord god
if i cause noisome beasts to pass through the land and they
spoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pass through because
of the beasts  though these three men were in it as i live
saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters
they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolate
or if i bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through
the land so that i cut off man and beast from it  though these
three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall
deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered
themselves
or if i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury
upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast  though noah
daniel and job were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall
deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own
souls by their righteousness
for thus saith the lord god how much more when i send my four
sore judgments upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the
noisome beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast
yet behold therein shall be left a remnant that shall be
brought forth both sons and daughters behold they shall come forth
unto you and ye shall see their way and their doings and ye shall be
comforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem even
concerning all that i have brought upon it
and they shall comfort you when ye see their ways and their
doings and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all that
i have done in it saith the lord god
and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
what is the vine tree more than any tree or than a branch which is
among the trees of the forest   shall wood be taken thereof to do
any work or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon
behold it is cast into the fire for fuel the fire devoureth
both the ends of it and the midst of it is burned is it meet for any
work   behold when it was whole it was meet for no work how
much less shall it be meet yet for any work when the fire hath
devoured it and it is burned   therefore thus saith the lord
god as the vine tree among the trees of the forest which i have
given to the fire for fuel so will i give the inhabitants of
jerusalem
and i will set my face against them they shall go out from one
fire and another fire shall devour them and ye shall know that i am
the lord when i set my face against them
and i will make the land desolate because they have committed a
trespass saith the lord god
again the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
cause jerusalem to know her abominations  and say thus saith the
lord god unto jerusalem thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of
canaan thy father was an amorite and thy mother an hittite
and as for thy nativity in the day thou wast born thy navel was
not cut neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee thou wast
not salted at all nor swaddled at all
none eye pitied thee to do any of these unto thee to have
compassion upon thee but thou wast cast out in the open field to the
lothing of thy person in the day that thou wast born
and when i passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own
blood i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live yea i said
unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live
i have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field and thou
hast increased and waxen great and thou art come to excellent
ornaments thy breasts are fashioned and thine hair is grown whereas
thou wast naked and bare
now when i passed by thee and looked upon thee behold thy time
was the time of love and i spread my skirt over thee and covered thy
nakedness yea i sware unto thee and entered into a covenant with
thee saith the lord god and thou becamest mine
then washed i thee with water yea i throughly washed away thy
blood from thee and i anointed thee with oil
i clothed thee also with broidered work and shod thee with
badgers skin and i girded thee about with fine linen and i covered
thee with silk
i decked thee also with ornaments and i put bracelets upon thy
hands and a chain on thy neck
and i put a jewel on thy forehead and earrings in thine ears
and a beautiful crown upon thine head
thus wast thou decked with gold and silver and thy raiment was
of fine linen and silk and broidered work thou didst eat fine
flour and honey and oil and thou wast exceeding beautiful and thou
didst prosper into a kingdom
and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for
it was perfect through my comeliness which i had put upon thee saith
the lord god
but thou didst trust in thine own beauty and playedst the
harlot because of thy renown and pouredst out thy fornications on
every one that passed by his it was
and of thy garments thou didst take and deckedst thy high
places with divers colours and playedst the harlot thereupon the
like things shall not come neither shall it be so
thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
silver which i had given thee and madest to thyself images of men
and didst commit whoredom with them  and tookest thy broidered
garments and coveredst them and thou hast set mine oil and mine
incense before them
my meat also which i gave thee fine flour and oil and honey
wherewith i fed thee thou hast even set it before them for a sweet
savour and thus it was saith the lord god
moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou
hast borne unto me and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be
devoured is this of thy whoredoms a small matter  that thou
hast slain my children and delivered them to cause them to pass
through the fire for them   and in all thine abominations and
thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth when
thou wast naked and bare and wast polluted in thy blood
and it came to pass after all thy wickedness woe woe unto
thee  saith the lord god  that thou hast also built unto thee
an eminent place and hast made thee an high place in every street
thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way and
hast made thy beauty to be abhorred and hast opened thy feet to every
one that passed by and multiplied thy whoredoms
thou hast also committed fornication with the egyptians thy
neighbours great of flesh and hast increased thy whoredoms to
provoke me to anger
behold therefore i have stretched out my hand over thee and
have diminished thine ordinary food and delivered thee unto the will
of them that hate thee the daughters of the philistines which are
ashamed of thy lewd way
thou hast played the whore also with the assyrians because thou
wast unsatiable yea thou hast played the harlot with them and yet
couldest not be satisfied
thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of
canaan unto chaldea and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith
how weak is thine heart saith the lord god seeing thou doest
all these things the work of an imperious whorish woman  in
that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way and
makest thine high place in every street and hast not been as an
harlot in that thou scornest hire  but as a wife that
committeth adultery which taketh strangers instead of her husband
they give gifts to all whores but thou givest thy gifts to all
thy lovers and hirest them that they may come unto thee on every
side for thy whoredom
and the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms
whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms and in that thou
givest a reward and no reward is given unto thee therefore thou art
contrary
wherefore o harlot hear the word of the lord  thus saith
the lord god because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness
discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers and with all the
idols of thy abominations and by the blood of thy children which
thou didst give unto them  behold therefore i will gather all
thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure and all them that thou
hast loved with all them that thou hast hated i will even gather
them round about against thee and will discover thy nakedness unto
them that they may see all thy nakedness
and i will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shed
blood are judged and i will give thee blood in fury and jealousy
and i will also give thee into their hand and they shall throw
down thine eminent place and shall break down thy high places they
shall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take thy fair jewels
and leave thee naked and bare
they shall also bring up a company against thee and they shall
stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords
and they shall burn thine houses with fire and execute
judgments upon thee in the sight of many women and i will cause thee
to cease from playing the harlot and thou also shalt give no hire any
more
so will i make my fury toward thee to rest and my jealousy
shall depart from thee and i will be quiet and will be no more
angry
because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast
fretted me in all these things behold therefore i also will
recompense thy way upon thine head saith the lord god and thou shalt
not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations
behold every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb
against thee saying as is the mother so is her daughter
thou art thy mothers daughter that lotheth her husband and her
children and thou art the sister of thy sisters which lothed their
husbands and their children your mother was an hittite and your
father an amorite
and thine elder sister is samaria she and her daughters that
dwell at thy left hand and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy
right hand is sodom and her daughters
yet hast thou not walked after their ways nor done after their
abominations but as if that were a very little thing thou wast
corrupted more than they in all thy ways
as i live saith the lord god sodom thy sister hath not done
she nor her daughters as thou hast done thou and thy daughters
behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride
fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her
daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy
and they were haughty and committed abomination before me
therefore i took them away as i saw good
neither hath samaria committed half of thy sins but thou hast
multiplied thine abominations more than they and hast justified thy
sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done
thou also which hast judged thy sisters bear thine own shame
for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they they
are more righteous than thou yea be thou confounded also and bear
thy shame in that thou hast justified thy sisters
when i shall bring again their captivity the captivity of sodom
and her daughters and the captivity of samaria and her daughters
then will i bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of
them  that thou mayest bear thine own shame and mayest be
confounded in all that thou hast done in that thou art a comfort unto
them
when thy sisters sodom and her daughters shall return to their
former estate and samaria and her daughters shall return to their
former estate then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former
estate
for thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day
of thy pride  before thy wickedness was discovered as at the
time of thy reproach of the daughters of syria and all that are round
about her the daughters of the philistines which despise thee round
about
thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations saith the
lord
for thus saith the lord god i will even deal with thee as thou
hast done which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant
nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the days
of thy youth and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant
then thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou
shalt receive thy sisters thine elder and thy younger and i will
give them unto thee for daughters but not by thy covenant
and i will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt know
that i am the lord  that thou mayest remember and be
confounded and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame
when i am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done saith the
lord god
and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
put forth a riddle and speak a parable unto the house of israel
and say thus saith the lord god a great eagle with great wings
longwinged full of feathers which had divers colours came unto
lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar  he cropped off
the top of his young twigs and carried it into a land of traffick he
set it in a city of merchants
he took also of the seed of the land and planted it in a
fruitful field he placed it by great waters and set it as a willow
tree
and it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature whose
branches turned toward him and the roots thereof were under him so
it became a vine and brought forth branches and shot forth sprigs
there was also another great eagle with great wings and many
feathers and behold this vine did bend her roots toward him and
shot forth her branches toward him that he might water it by the
furrows of her plantation
it was planted in a good soil by great waters that it might
bring forth branches and that it might bear fruit that it might be a
goodly vine
say thou thus saith the lord god shall it prosper shall he not
pull up the roots thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that it
wither it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring even without
great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof
yea behold being planted shall it prosper shall it not
utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it it shall wither in the
furrows where it grew
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  say
now to the rebellious house know ye not what these things mean  tell
them behold the king of babylon is come to jerusalem and hath taken
the king thereof and the princes thereof and led them with him to
babylon  and hath taken of the kings seed and made a covenant
with him and hath taken an oath of him he hath also taken the mighty
of the land  that the kingdom might be base that it might not
lift itself up but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand
but he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into
egypt that they might give him horses and much people shall he
prosper shall he escape that doeth such things or shall he break the
covenant and be delivered   as i live saith the lord god
surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king whose
oath he despised and whose covenant he brake even with him in the
midst of babylon he shall die
neither shall pharaoh with his mighty army and great company
make for him in the war by casting up mounts and building forts to
cut off many persons  seeing he despised the oath by breaking
the covenant when lo he had given his hand and hath done all these
things he shall not escape
therefore thus saith the lord god as i live surely mine oath
that he hath despised and my covenant that he hath broken even it
will i recompense upon his own head
and i will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my
snare and i will bring him to babylon and will plead with him there
for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me
and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the
sword and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds and
ye shall know that i the lord have spoken it
thus saith the lord god i will also take of the highest branch
of the high cedar and will set it i will crop off from the top of
his young twigs a tender one and will plant it upon an high mountain
and eminent  in the mountain of the height of israel will i
plant it and it shall bring forth boughs and bear fruit and be a
goodly cedar and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing in the
shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell
and all the trees of the field shall know that i the lord have
brought down the high tree have exalted the low tree have dried up
the green tree and have made the dry tree to flourish i the lord
have spoken and have done it
the word of the lord came unto me again saying  what mean
ye that ye use this proverb concerning the land of israel saying
the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set
on edge   as i live saith the lord god ye shall not have
occasion any more to use this proverb in israel
behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also
the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die
but if a man be just and do that which is lawful and right
and hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes
to the idols of the house of israel neither hath defiled his
neighbours wife neither hath come near to a menstruous woman
and hath not oppressed any but hath restored to the debtor his
pledge hath spoiled none by violence hath given his bread to the
hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment  he that hath
not given forth upon usury neither hath taken any increase that hath
withdrawn his hand from iniquity hath executed true judgment between
man and man  hath walked in my statutes and hath kept my
judgments to deal truly he is just he shall surely live saith the
lord god
if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and that
doeth the like to any one of these things  and that doeth not
any of those duties but even hath eaten upon the mountains and
defiled his neighbours wife  hath oppressed the poor and needy
hath spoiled by violence hath not restored the pledge and hath
lifted up his eyes to the idols hath committed abomination
hath given forth upon usury and hath taken increase shall he then
live he shall not live he hath done all these abominations he shall
surely die his blood shall be upon him
now lo if he beget a son that seeth all his fathers sins
which he hath done and considereth and doeth not such like
that hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his
eyes to the idols of the house of israel hath not defiled his
neighbours wife  neither hath oppressed any hath not
withholden the pledge neither hath spoiled by violence but hath
given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a
garment  that hath taken off his hand from the poor that hath
not received usury nor increase hath executed my judgments hath
walked in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his
father he shall surely live
as for his father because he cruelly oppressed spoiled his
brother by violence and did that which is not good among his people
lo even he shall die in his iniquity
yet say ye why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the
father  when the son hath done that which is lawful and right and
hath kept all my statutes and hath done them he shall surely live
the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the
iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of
the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the
wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath
committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and
right he shall surely live he shall not die
all his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be
mentioned unto him in his righteousness that he hath done he shall
live
have i any pleasure at all that the wicked should die saith the
lord god and not that he should return from his ways and live
but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and
committeth iniquity and doeth according to all the abominations that
the wicked man doeth shall he live all his righteousness that he
hath done shall not be mentioned in his trespass that he hath
trespassed and in his sin that he hath sinned in them shall he die
yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal hear now o house
of israel is not my way equal are not your ways unequal   when
a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committeth
iniquity and dieth in them for his iniquity that he hath done shall
he die
again when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that
he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall
save his soul alive
because he considereth and turneth away from all his
transgressions that he hath committed he shall surely live he shall
not die
yet saith the house of israel the way of the lord is not equal
o house of israel are not my ways equal are not your ways unequal
therefore i will judge you o house of israel every one
according to his ways saith the lord god repent and turn yourselves
from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin
cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have
transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will
ye die o house of israel   for i have no pleasure in the death
of him that dieth saith the lord god wherefore turn yourselves and
live ye
moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel
and say what is thy mother a lioness she lay down among lions
she nourished her whelps among young lions
and she brought up one of her whelps it became a young lion and
it learned to catch the prey it devoured men
the nations also heard of him he was taken in their pit and
they brought him with chains unto the land of egypt
now when she saw that she had waited and her hope was lost then
she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion
and he went up and down among the lions he became a young lion
and learned to catch the prey and devoured men
and he knew their desolate palaces and he laid waste their
cities and the land was desolate and the fulness thereof by the
noise of his roaring
then the nations set against him on every side from the
provinces and spread their net over him he was taken in their pit
and they put him in ward in chains and brought him to the king
of babylon they brought him into holds that his voice should no more
be heard upon the mountains of israel
thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the waters
she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters
and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule
and her stature was exalted among the thick branches and she appeared
in her height with the multitude of her branches
but she was plucked up in fury she was cast down to the ground
and the east wind dried up her fruit her strong rods were broken and
withered the fire consumed them
and now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty
ground
and fire is gone out of a rod of her branches which hath
devoured her fruit so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to
rule this is a lamentation and shall be for a lamentation
and it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth month the
tenth day of the month that certain of the elders of israel came to
enquire of the lord and sat before me
then came the word of the lord unto me saying  son of man
speak unto the elders of israel and say unto them thus saith the
lord god are ye come to enquire of me as i live saith the lord god
i will not be enquired of by you
wilt thou judge them son of man wilt thou judge them cause
them to know the abominations of their fathers  and say unto
them thus saith the lord god in the day when i chose israel and
lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of jacob and made
myself known unto them in the land of egypt when i lifted up mine
hand unto them saying i am the lord your god  in the day that i
lifted up mine hand unto them to bring them forth of the land of
egypt into a land that i had espied for them flowing with milk and
honey which is the glory of all lands  then said i unto them
cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes and defile not
yourselves with the idols of egypt i am the lord your god
but they rebelled against me and would not hearken unto me they
did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes neither
did they forsake the idols of egypt then i said i will pour out my
fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of
the land of egypt
but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted
before the heathen among whom they were in whose sight i made myself
known unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of egypt
wherefore i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt
and brought them into the wilderness
and i gave them my statutes and shewed them my judgments which
if a man do he shall even live in them
moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me
and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them
but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wilderness
they walked not in my statutes and they despised my judgments which
if a man do he shall even live in them and my sabbaths they greatly
polluted then i said i would pour out my fury upon them in the
wilderness to consume them
but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted
before the heathen in whose sight i brought them out
yet also i lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness that i
would not bring them into the land which i had given them flowing
with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands  because
they despised my judgments and walked not in my statutes but
polluted my sabbaths for their heart went after their idols
nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them neither
did i make an end of them in the wilderness
but i said unto their children in the wilderness walk ye not in
the statutes of your fathers neither observe their judgments nor
defile yourselves with their idols  i am the lord your god walk
in my statutes and keep my judgments and do them  and hallow
my sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye may
know that i am the lord your god
notwithstanding the children rebelled against me they walked
not in my statutes neither kept my judgments to do them which if a
man do he shall even live in them they polluted my sabbaths then i
said i would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger
against them in the wilderness
nevertheless i withdrew mine hand and wrought for my names
sake that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen in
whose sight i brought them forth
i lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness that i
would scatter them among the heathen and disperse them through the
countries  because they had not executed my judgments but had
despised my statutes and had polluted my sabbaths and their eyes
were after their fathers idols
wherefore i gave them also statutes that were not good and
judgments whereby they should not live  and i polluted them in
their own gifts in that they caused to pass through the fire all that
openeth the womb that i might make them desolate to the end that
they might know that i am the lord
therefore son of man speak unto the house of israel and say
unto them thus saith the lord god yet in this your fathers have
blasphemed me in that they have committed a trespass against me
for when i had brought them into the land for the which i
lifted up mine hand to give it to them then they saw every high hill
and all the thick trees and they offered there their sacrifices and
there they presented the provocation of their offering there also
they made their sweet savour and poured out there their drink
offerings
then i said unto them what is the high place whereunto ye go
and the name whereof is called bamah unto this day
wherefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god
are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers and commit ye
whoredom after their abominations   for when ye offer your
gifts when ye make your sons to pass through the fire ye pollute
yourselves with all your idols even unto this day and shall i be
enquired of by you o house of israel as i live saith the lord god
i will not be enquired of by you
and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all that
ye say we will be as the heathen as the families of the countries
to serve wood and stone
as i live saith the lord god surely with a mighty hand and
with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out will i rule over
you  and i will bring you out from the people and will gather
you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered with a mighty hand
and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out
and i will bring you into the wilderness of the people and
there will i plead with you face to face
like as i pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the
land of egypt so will i plead with you saith the lord god
and i will cause you to pass under the rod and i will bring you
into the bond of the covenant  and i will purge out from among
you the rebels and them that transgress against me i will bring them
forth out of the country where they sojourn and they shall not enter
into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord
as for you o house of israel thus saith the lord god go ye
serve ye every one his idols and hereafter also if ye will not
hearken unto me but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts
and with your idols
for in mine holy mountain in the mountain of the height of
israel saith the lord god there shall all the house of israel all
of them in the land serve me there will i accept them and there
will i require your offerings and the firstfruits of your oblations
with all your holy things
i will accept you with your sweet savour when i bring you out
from the people and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have
been scattered and i will be sanctified in you before the heathen
and ye shall know that i am the lord when i shall bring you
into the land of israel into the country for the which i lifted up
mine hand to give it to your fathers
and there shall ye remember your ways and all your doings
wherein ye have been defiled and ye shall lothe yourselves in your
own sight for all your evils that ye have committed
and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have wrought with
you for my names sake not according to your wicked ways nor
according to your corrupt doings o ye house of israel saith the lord
god
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of
man set thy face toward the south and drop thy word toward the
south and prophesy against the forest of the south field  and
say to the forest of the south hear the word of the lord thus saith
the lord god behold i will kindle a fire in thee and it shall
devour every green tree in thee and every dry tree the flaming flame
shall not be quenched and all faces from the south to the north shall
be burned therein
and all flesh shall see that i the lord have kindled it it
shall not be quenched
then said i ah lord god they say of me doth he not speak
parables   and the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man set thy face toward jerusalem and drop thy word toward
the holy places and prophesy against the land of israel  and say
to the land of israel thus saith the lord behold i am against thee
and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath and will cut off from
thee the righteous and the wicked
seeing then that i will cut off from thee the righteous and the
wicked therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against
all flesh from the south to the north  that all flesh may know
that i the lord have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath it shall
not return any more
sigh therefore thou son of man with the breaking of thy loins
and with bitterness sigh before their eyes
and it shall be when they say unto thee wherefore sighest thou
that thou shalt answer for the tidings because it cometh and every
heart shall melt and all hands shall be feeble and every spirit
shall faint and all knees shall be weak as water behold it cometh
and shall be brought to pass saith the lord god
again the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
prophesy and say thus saith the lord say a sword a sword is
sharpened and also furbished  it is sharpened to make a sore
slaughter it is furbished that it may glitter should we then make
mirth it contemneth the rod of my son as every tree
and he hath given it to be furbished that it may be handled
this sword is sharpened and it is furbished to give it into the hand
of the slayer
cry and howl son of man for it shall be upon my people it
shall be upon all the princes of israel terrors by reason of the
sword shall be upon my people smite therefore upon thy thigh
because it is a trial and what if the sword contemn even the
rod  it shall be no more saith the lord god
thou therefore son of man prophesy and smite thine hands
together and let the sword be doubled the third time the sword of
the slain it is the sword of the great men that are slain which
entereth into their privy chambers
i have set the point of the sword against all their gates that
their heart may faint and their ruins be multiplied ah it is made
bright it is wrapped up for the slaughter
go thee one way or other either on the right hand or on the
left whithersoever thy face is set
i will also smite mine hands together and i will cause my fury
to rest i the lord have said it
the word of the lord came unto me again saying  also
thou son of man appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of
babylon may come both twain shall come forth out of one land and
choose thou a place choose it at the head of the way to the city
appoint a way that the sword may come to rabbath of the
ammonites and to judah in jerusalem the defenced
for the king of babylon stood at the parting of the way at the
head of the two ways to use divination he made his arrows bright he
consulted with images he looked in the liver
at his right hand was the divination for jerusalem to appoint
captains to open the mouth in the slaughter to lift up the voice
with shouting to appoint battering rams against the gates to cast a
mount and to build a fort
and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight
to them that have sworn oaths but he will call to remembrance the
iniquity that they may be taken
therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have made your
iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are discovered
so that in all your doings your sins do appear because i say that
ye are come to remembrance ye shall be taken with the hand
and thou profane wicked prince of israel whose day is come
when iniquity shall have an end  thus saith the lord god remove
the diadem and take off the crown this shall not be the same exalt
him that is low and abase him that is high
i will overturn overturn overturn it and it shall be no
more until he come whose right it is and i will give it him
and thou son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god
concerning the ammonites and concerning their reproach even say
thou the sword the sword is drawn for the slaughter it is
furbished to consume because of the glittering  whiles they see
vanity unto thee whiles they divine a lie unto thee to bring thee
upon the necks of them that are slain of the wicked whose day is
come when their iniquity shall have an end
shall i cause it to return into his sheath i will judge thee in
the place where thou wast created in the land of thy nativity
and i will pour out mine indignation upon thee i will blow
against thee in the fire of my wrath and deliver thee into the hand
of brutish men and skilful to destroy
thou shalt be for fuel to the fire thy blood shall be in the
midst of the land thou shalt be no more remembered for i the lord
have spoken it
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  now
thou son of man wilt thou judge wilt thou judge the bloody city
yea thou shalt shew her all her abominations
then say thou thus saith the lord god the city sheddeth blood
in the midst of it that her time may come and maketh idols against
herself to defile herself
thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed and hast
defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made and thou hast
caused thy days to draw near and art come even unto thy years
therefore have i made thee a reproach unto the heathen and a mocking
to all countries
those that be near and those that be far from thee shall mock
thee which art infamous and much vexed
behold the princes of israel every one were in thee to their
power to shed blood
in thee have they set light by father and mother in the midst of
thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger in thee have
they vexed the fatherless and the widow
thou hast despised mine holy things and hast profaned my
sabbaths
in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood and in thee they
eat upon the mountains in the midst of thee they commit lewdness
in thee have they discovered their fathers nakedness in thee
have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution
and one hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife
and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law and another in
thee hath humbled his sister his fathers daughter
in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood thou hast taken
usury and increase and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by
extortion and hast forgotten me saith the lord god
behold therefore i have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain
which thou hast made and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of
thee
can thine heart endure or can thine hands be strong in the
days that i shall deal with thee i the lord have spoken it and will
do it
and i will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee in
the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of thee
and thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of
the heathen and thou shalt know that i am the lord
and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
the house of israel is to me become dross all they are brass and
tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace they are even
the dross of silver
therefore thus saith the lord god because ye are all become
dross behold therefore i will gather you into the midst of
jerusalem
as they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin
into the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it
so will i gather you in mine anger and in my fury and i will leave
you there and melt you
yea i will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my
wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst therof
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall ye be
melted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i the lord have
poured out my fury upon you
and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
say unto her thou art the land that is not cleansed nor rained upon
in the day of indignation
there is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof like
a roaring lion ravening the prey they have devoured souls they have
taken the treasure and precious things they have made her many widows
in the midst thereof
her priests have violated my law and have profaned mine holy
things they have put no difference between the holy and profane
neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean
and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and i am profaned among
them
her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the
prey to shed blood and to destroy souls to get dishonest gain
and her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter seeing
vanity and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the lord god
when the lord hath not spoken
the people of the land have used oppression and exercised
robbery and have vexed the poor and needy yea they have oppressed
the stranger wrongfully
and i sought for a man among them that should make up the
hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not
destroy it but i found none
therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them i have
consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have i
recompensed upon their heads saith the lord god
the word of the lord came again unto me saying  son of man
there were two women the daughters of one mother  and they
committed whoredoms in egypt they committed whoredoms in their youth
there were their breasts pressed and there they bruised the teats of
their virginity
and the names of them were aholah the elder and aholibah her
sister and they were mine and they bare sons and daughters thus
were their names samaria is aholah and jerusalem aholibah
and aholah played the harlot when she was mine and she doted on
her lovers on the assyrians her neighbours  which were clothed
with blue captains and rulers all of them desirable young men
horsemen riding upon horses
thus she committed her whoredoms with them with all them that
were the chosen men of assyria and with all on whom she doted with
all their idols she defiled herself
neither left she her whoredoms brought from egypt for in her
youth they lay with her and they bruised the breasts of her
virginity and poured their whoredom upon her
wherefore i have delivered her into the hand of her lovers into
the hand of the assyrians upon whom she doted
these discovered her nakedness they took her sons and her
daughters and slew her with the sword and she became famous among
women for they had executed judgment upon her
and when her sister aholibah saw this she was more corrupt in
her inordinate love than she and in her whoredoms more than her
sister in her whoredoms
she doted upon the assyrians her neighbours captains and rulers
clothed most gorgeously horsemen riding upon horses all of them
desirable young men
then i saw that she was defiled that they took both one way
and that she increased her whoredoms for when she saw men
pourtrayed upon the wall the images of the chaldeans pourtrayed with
vermilion  girded with girdles upon their loins exceeding in
dyed attire upon their heads all of them princes to look to after
the manner of the babylonians of chaldea the land of their nativity
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon them
and sent messengers unto them into chaldea
and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love and they
defiled her with their whoredom and she was polluted with them and
her mind was alienated from them
so she discovered her whoredoms and discovered her nakedness
then my mind was alienated from her like as my mind was alienated
from her sister
yet she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance the
days of her youth wherein she had played the harlot in the land of
egypt
for she doted upon their paramours whose flesh is as the flesh
of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses
thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth in
bruising thy teats by the egyptians for the paps of thy youth
therefore o aholibah thus saith the lord god behold i will
raise up thy lovers against thee from whom thy mind is alienated and
i will bring them against thee on every side  the babylonians
and all the chaldeans pekod and shoa and koa and all the assyrians
with them all of them desirable young men captains and rulers great
lords and renowned all of them riding upon horses
and they shall come against thee with chariots wagons and
wheels and with an assembly of people which shall set against thee
buckler and shield and helmet round about and i will set judgment
before them and they shall judge thee according to their judgments
and i will set my jealousy against thee and they shall deal
furiously with thee they shall take away thy nose and thine ears and
thy remnant shall fall by the sword they shall take thy sons and thy
daughters and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire
they shall also strip thee out of thy clothes and take away thy
fair jewels
thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy
whoredom brought from the land of egypt so that thou shalt not lift
up thine eyes unto them nor remember egypt any more
for thus saith the lord god behold i will deliver thee into
the hand of them whom thou hatest into the hand of them from whom thy
mind is alienated  and they shall deal with thee hatefully and
shall take away all thy labour and shall leave thee naked and bare
and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered both thy
lewdness and thy whoredoms
i will do these things unto thee because thou hast gone a
whoring after the heathen and because thou art polluted with their
idols
thou hast walked in the way of thy sister therefore will i give
her cup into thine hand
thus saith the lord god thou shalt drink of thy sisters cup
deep and large thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision it
containeth much
thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup
of astonishment and desolation with the cup of thy sister samaria
thou shalt even drink it and suck it out and thou shalt break
the sherds thereof and pluck off thine own breasts for i have spoken
it saith the lord god
therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast forgotten
me and cast me behind thy back therefore bear thou also thy lewdness
and thy whoredoms
the lord said moreover unto me son of man wilt thou judge
aholah and aholibah yea declare unto them their abominations
that they have committed adultery and blood is in their hands and
with their idols have they committed adultery and have also caused
their sons whom they bare unto me to pass for them through the fire
to devour them
moreover this they have done unto me they have defiled my
sanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbaths
for when they had slain their children to their idols then they
came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it and lo thus have
they done in the midst of mine house
and furthermore that ye have sent for men to come from far
unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thou
didst wash thyself paintedst thy eyes and deckedst thyself with
ornaments  and satest upon a stately bed and a table prepared
before it whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil
and a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her and with
the men of the common sort were brought sabeans from the wilderness
which put bracelets upon their hands and beautiful crowns upon their
heads
then said i unto her that was old in adulteries will they now
commit whoredoms with her and she with them   yet they went in
unto her as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot so went
they in unto aholah and unto aholibah the lewd women
and the righteous men they shall judge them after the manner of
adulteresses and after the manner of women that shed blood because
they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands
for thus saith the lord god i will bring up a company upon
them and will give them to be removed and spoiled
and the company shall stone them with stones and dispatch them
with their swords they shall slay their sons and their daughters and
burn up their houses with fire
thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land that all
women may be taught not to do after your lewdness
and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you and ye shall
bear the sins of your idols and ye shall know that i am the lord god
again in the ninth year in the tenth month in the tenth day of
the month the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
write thee the name of the day even of this same day the king of
babylon set himself against jerusalem this same day
and utter a parable unto the rebellious house and say unto them
thus saith the lord god set on a pot set it on and also pour water
into it  gather the pieces thereof into it even every good
piece the thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choice bones
take the choice of the flock and burn also the bones under it
and make it boil well and let them seethe the bones of it therein
wherefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city to the
pot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it bring
it out piece by piece let no lot fall upon it
for her blood is in the midst of her she set it upon the top of
a rock she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust
that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance i have set her
blood upon the top of a rock that it should not be covered
therefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city i will
even make the pile for fire great
heap on wood kindle the fire consume the flesh and spice it
well and let the bones be burned
then set it empty upon the coals thereof that the brass of it
may be hot and may burn and that the filthiness of it may be molten
in it that the scum of it may be consumed
she hath wearied herself with lies and her great scum went not
forth out of her her scum shall be in the fire
in thy filthiness is lewdness because i have purged thee and
thou wast not purged thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any
more till i have caused my fury to rest upon thee
i the lord have spoken it it shall come to pass and i will do
it i will not go back neither will i spare neither will i repent
according to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge
thee saith the lord god
also the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of
man behold i take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a
stroke yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep neither shall thy tears
run down
forbear to cry make no mourning for the dead bind the tire of
thine head upon thee and put on thy shoes upon thy feet and cover
not thy lips and eat not the bread of men
so i spake unto the people in the morning and at even my wife
died and i did in the morning as i was commanded
and the people said unto me wilt thou not tell us what these
things are to us that thou doest so   then i answered them the
word of the lord came unto me saying  speak unto the house of
israel thus saith the lord god behold i will profane my sanctuary
the excellency of your strength the desire of your eyes and that
which your soul pitieth and your sons and your daughters whom ye have
left shall fall by the sword
and ye shall do as i have done ye shall not cover your lips
nor eat the bread of men
and your tires shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon
your feet ye shall not mourn nor weep but ye shall pine away for
your iniquities and mourn one toward another
thus ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all that he hath
done shall ye do and when this cometh ye shall know that i am the
lord god
also thou son of man shall it not be in the day when i take
from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their
eyes and that whereupon they set their minds their sons and their
daughters  that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto
thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears   in that day
shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped and thou shalt
speak and be no more dumb and thou shalt be a sign unto them and
they shall know that i am the lord
the word of the lord came again unto me saying  son of man
set thy face against the ammonites and prophesy against them
and say unto the ammonites hear the word of the lord god thus saith
the lord god because thou saidst aha against my sanctuary when it
was profaned and against the land of israel when it was desolate
and against the house of judah when they went into captivity
behold therefore i will deliver thee to the men of the east for a
possession and they shall set their palaces in thee and make their
dwellings in thee they shall eat thy fruit and they shall drink thy
milk
and i will make rabbah a stable for camels and the ammonites a
couching place for flocks and ye shall know that i am the lord
for thus saith the lord god because thou hast clapped thine
hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced in heart with all thy
despite against the land of israel  behold therefore i will
stretch out mine hand upon thee and will deliver thee for a spoil to
the heathen and i will cut thee off from the people and i will cause
thee to perish out of the countries i will destroy thee and thou
shalt know that i am the lord
thus saith the lord god because that moab and seir do say
behold the house of judah is like unto all the heathen
therefore behold i will open the side of moab from the cities from
his cities which are on his frontiers the glory of the country
bethjeshimoth baalmeon and kiriathaim  unto the men of the
east with the ammonites and will give them in possession that the
ammonites may not be remembered among the nations
and i will execute judgments upon moab and they shall know that
i am the lord
thus saith the lord god because that edom hath dealt against
the house of judah by taking vengeance and hath greatly offended and
revenged himself upon them  therefore thus saith the lord god i
will also stretch out mine hand upon edom and will cut off man and
beast from it and i will make it desolate from teman and they of
dedan shall fall by the sword
and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people
israel and they shall do in edom according to mine anger and
according to my fury and they shall know my vengeance saith the lord
god
thus saith the lord god because the philistines have dealt by
revenge and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart to destroy
it for the old hatred  therefore thus saith the lord god
behold i will stretch out mine hand upon the philistines and i will
cut off the cherethims and destroy the remnant of the sea coast
and i will execute great vengeance upon them with furious
rebukes and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall lay my
vengeance upon them
and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first day of the
month that the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of
man because that tyrus hath said against jerusalem aha she is
broken that was the gates of the people she is turned unto me i
shall be replenished now she is laid waste  therefore thus saith
the lord god behold i am against thee o tyrus and will cause many
nations to come up against thee as the sea causeth his waves to come
up
and they shall destroy the walls of tyrus and break down her
towers i will also scrape her dust from her and make her like the
top of a rock
it shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the
sea for i have spoken it saith the lord god and it shall become a
spoil to the nations
and her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the
sword and they shall know that i am the lord
for thus saith the lord god behold i will bring upon tyrus
nebuchadrezzar king of babylon a king of kings from the north with
horses and with chariots and with horsemen and companies and much
people
he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field and he
shall make a fort against thee and cast a mount against thee and
lift up the buckler against thee
and he shall set engines of war against thy walls and with his
axes he shall break down thy towers
by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover
thee thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the
wheels and of the chariots when he shall enter into thy gates as
men enter into a city wherein is made a breach
with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy
streets he shall slay thy people by the sword and thy strong
garrisons shall go down to the ground
and they shall make a spoil of thy riches and make a prey of
thy merchandise and they shall break down thy walls and destroy thy
pleasant houses and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy
dust in the midst of the water
and i will cause the noise of thy songs to cease and the sound
of thy harps shall be no more heard
and i will make thee like the top of a rock thou shalt be a
place to spread nets upon thou shalt be built no more for i the lord
have spoken it saith the lord god
thus saith the lord god to tyrus shall not the isles shake at
the sound of thy fall when the wounded cry when the slaughter is
made in the midst of thee   then all the princes of the sea
shall come down from their thrones and lay away their robes and put
off their broidered garments they shall clothe themselves with
trembling they shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble at every
moment and be astonished at thee
and they shall take up a lamentation for thee and say to thee
how art thou destroyed that wast inhabited of seafaring men the
renowned city which wast strong in the sea she and her inhabitants
which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it   now shall
the isles tremble in the day of thy fall yea the isles that are in
the sea shall be troubled at thy departure
for thus saith the lord god when i shall make thee a desolate
city like the cities that are not inhabited when i shall bring up
the deep upon thee and great waters shall cover thee  when i
shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit with the
people of old time and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth
in places desolate of old with them that go down to the pit that
thou be not inhabited and i shall set glory in the land of the
living  i will make thee a terror and thou shalt be no more
though thou be sought for yet shalt thou never be found again saith
the lord god
the word of the lord came again unto me saying  now thou
son of man take up a lamentation for tyrus  and say unto tyrus
o thou that art situate at the entry of the sea which art a merchant
of the people for many isles thus saith the lord god o tyrus thou

the word of the lord came again unto me saying  son of man
say unto the prince of tyrus thus saith the lord god because thine
heart is lifted up and thou hast said i am a god i sit in the seat
of god in the midst of the seas yet thou art a man and not god
though thou set thine heart as the heart of god  behold thou art
wiser than daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee
with thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten
thee riches and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures
by thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy
riches and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches
therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast set thine heart
as the heart of god  behold therefore i will bring strangers
upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall draw their
swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy
brightness
they shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the
deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas
wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee i am god but
thou shalt be a man and no god in the hand of him that slayeth thee
thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of
strangers for i have spoken it saith the lord god
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of
man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him
thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and
perfect in beauty
thou hast been in eden the garden of god every precious stone
was thy covering the sardius topaz and the diamond the beryl the
onyx and the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle
and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared
in thee in the day that thou wast created
thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee
so thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and
down in the midst of the stones of fire
thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
created till iniquity was found in thee
by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst
of thee with violence and thou hast sinned therefore i will cast
thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy thee o
covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire
thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast
corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to
the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee

iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffick therefore will i bring
forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will
bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that
behold thee
all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at
thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be any more
again the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of
man set thy face against zidon and prophesy against it  and
say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o zidon and
i will be glorified in the midst of thee and they shall know that i
am the lord when i shall have executed judgments in her and shall be
sanctified in her
for i will send into her pestilence and blood into her streets
and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon
her on every side and they shall know that i am the lord
and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of
israel nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them that
despised them and they shall know that i am the lord god
thus saith the lord god when i shall have gathered the house of
israel from the people among whom they are scattered and shall be
sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen then shall they dwell
in their land that i have given to my servant jacob
and they shall dwell safely therein and shall build houses and
plant vineyards yea they shall dwell with confidence when i have
executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them
and they shall know that i am the lord their god
in the tenth year in the tenth month in the twelfth day of the
month the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man set
thy face against pharaoh king of egypt and prophesy against him and
against all egypt  speak and say thus saith the lord god
behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon
that lieth in the midst of his rivers which hath said my river is
mine own and i have made it for myself
but i will put hooks in thy jaws and i will cause the fish of
thy rivers to stick unto thy scales and i will bring thee up out of
the midst of thy rivers and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick
unto thy scales
and i will leave thee thrown into the wilderness thee and all
the fish of thy rivers thou shalt fall upon the open fields thou
shalt not be brought together nor gathered i have given thee for
meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven
and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i am the lord
because they have been a staff of reed to the house of israel
when they took hold of thee by thy hand thou didst break and
rend all their shoulder and when they leaned upon thee thou brakest
and madest all their loins to be at a stand
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will bring a sword
upon thee and cut off man and beast out of thee
and the land of egypt shall be desolate and waste and they shall
know that i am the lord because he hath said the river is mine and
i have made it
behold therefore i am against thee and against thy rivers and
i will make the land of egypt utterly waste and desolate from the
tower of syene even unto the border of ethiopia
no foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall
pass through it neither shall it be inhabited forty years
and i will make the land of egypt desolate in the midst of the
countries that are desolate and her cities among the cities that are
laid waste shall be desolate forty years and i will scatter the
egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the
countries
yet thus saith the lord god at the end of forty years will i
gather the egyptians from the people whither they were scattered
and i will bring again the captivity of egypt and will cause
them to return into the land of pathros into the land of their
habitation and they shall be there a base kingdom
it shall be the basest of the kingdoms neither shall it exalt
itself any more above the nations for i will diminish them that they
shall no more rule over the nations
and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of israel
which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance when they shall look
after them but they shall know that i am the lord god
and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the
first month in the first day of the month the word of the lord came
unto me saying  son of man nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
caused his army to serve a great service against tyrus every head was
made bald and every shoulder was peeled yet had he no wages nor his
army for tyrus for the service that he had served against it
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will give the land of
egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take her
multitude and take her spoil and take her prey and it shall be the
wages for his army
i have given him the land of egypt for his labour wherewith he
served against it because they wrought for me saith the lord god
in that day will i cause the horn of the house of israel to bud
forth and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of
them and they shall know that i am the lord
the word of the lord came again unto me saying  son of man
prophesy and say thus saith the lord god howl ye woe worth the day
for the day is near even the day of the lord is near a cloudy
day it shall be the time of the heathen
and the sword shall come upon egypt and great pain shall be in
ethiopia when the slain shall fall in egypt and they shall take away
her multitude and her foundations shall be broken down
ethiopia and libya and lydia and all the mingled people and
chub and the men of the land that is in league shall fall with them
by the sword
thus saith the lord they also that uphold egypt shall fall and
the pride of her power shall come down from the tower of syene shall
they fall in it by the sword saith the lord god
and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are
desolate and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are
wasted
and they shall know that i am the lord when i have set a fire in
egypt and when all her helpers shall be destroyed
in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make
the careless ethiopians afraid and great pain shall come upon them
as in the day of egypt for lo it cometh
thus saith the lord god i will also make the multitude of egypt
to cease by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon
he and his people with him the terrible of the nations shall
be brought to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords
against egypt and fill the land with the slain
and i will make the rivers dry and sell the land into the hand
of the wicked and i will make the land waste and all that is
therein by the hand of strangers i the lord have spoken it
thus saith the lord god i will also destroy the idols and i
will cause their images to cease out of noph and there shall be no
more a prince of the land of egypt and i will put a fear in the land
of egypt
and i will make pathros desolate and will set fire in zoan and
will execute judgments in no
and i will pour my fury upon sin the strength of egypt and i
will cut off the multitude of no
and i will set fire in egypt sin shall have great pain and no
shall be rent asunder and noph shall have distresses daily
the young men of aven and of pibeseth shall fall by the sword
and these cities shall go into captivity
at tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened when i shall
break there the yokes of egypt and the pomp of her strength shall
cease in her as for her a cloud shall cover her and her daughters
shall go into captivity
thus will i execute judgments in egypt and they shall know that
i am the lord
and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first month in
the seventh day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me
saying  son of man i have broken the arm of pharaoh king of
egypt and lo it shall not be bound up to be healed to put a roller
to bind it to make it strong to hold the sword
therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against pharaoh
king of egypt and will break his arms the strong and that which was
broken and i will cause the sword to fall out of his hand
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will
disperse them through the countries
and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and put
my sword in his hand but i will break pharaohs arms and he shall
groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man
but i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and the
arms of pharaoh shall fall down and they shall know that i am the
lord when i shall put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon
and he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt
and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and disperse
them among the countries and they shall know that i am the lord
and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the third month in
the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me
saying  son of man speak unto pharaoh king of egypt and to his
multitude whom art thou like in thy greatness   behold the
assyrian was a cedar in lebanon with fair branches and with a
shadowing shroud and of an high stature and his top was among the
thick boughs
the waters made him great the deep set him up on high with her
rivers running round about his plants and sent her little rivers unto
all the trees of the field
therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the
field and his boughs were multiplied and his branches became long
because of the multitude of waters when he shot forth
all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs and under
his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young
and under his shadow dwelt all great nations
thus was he fair in his greatness in the length of his branches
for his root was by great waters
the cedars in the garden of god could not hide him the fir trees
were not like his boughs and the chestnut trees were not like his
branches nor any tree in the garden of god was like unto him in his
beauty
i have made him fair by the multitude of his branches so that
all the trees of eden that were in the garden of god envied him
therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast lifted up
thyself in height and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs
and his heart is lifted up in his height  i have therefore
delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen he shall
surely deal with him i have driven him out for his wickedness
and strangers the terrible of the nations have cut him off
and have left him upon the mountains and in all the valleys his
branches are fallen and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of
the land and all the people of the earth are gone down from his
shadow and have left him
upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain and all
the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches  to the end
that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their
height neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs neither
their trees stand up in their height all that drink water for they
are all delivered unto death to the nether parts of the earth in the
midst of the children of men with them that go down to the pit
thus saith the lord god in the day when he went down to the
grave i caused a mourning i covered the deep for him and i
restrained the floods thereof and the great waters were stayed and i
caused lebanon to mourn for him and all the trees of the field
fainted for him
i made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall when i
cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit and all the
trees of eden the choice and best of lebanon all that drink water
shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain
with the sword and they that were his arm that dwelt under his
shadow in the midst of the heathen
to whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the
trees of eden yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of eden
unto the nether parts of the earth thou shalt lie in the midst of the
uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword this is pharaoh
and all his multitude saith the lord god
and it came to pass in the twelfth year in the twelfth month in
the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me
saying  son of man take up a lamentation for pharaoh king of
egypt and say unto him thou art like a young lion of the nations
and thou art as a whale in the seas and thou camest forth with thy
rivers and troubledst the waters with thy feet and fouledst their
rivers
thus saith the lord god i will therefore spread out my net over
thee with a company of many people and they shall bring thee up in my
net
then will i leave thee upon the land i will cast thee forth upon
the open field and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain
upon thee and i will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee
and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys
with thy height
i will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest
even to the mountains and the rivers shall be full of thee
and when i shall put thee out i will cover the heaven and make
the stars thereof dark i will cover the sun with a cloud and the
moon shall not give her light
all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee and
set darkness upon thy land saith the lord god
i will also vex the hearts of many people when i shall bring thy
destruction among the nations into the countries which thou hast not
known
yea i will make many people amazed at thee and their kings
shall be horribly afraid for thee when i shall brandish my sword
before them and they shall tremble at every moment every man for his
own life in the day of thy fall
for thus saith the lord god the sword of the king of babylon
shall come upon thee
by the swords of the mighty will i cause thy multitude to fall
the terrible of the nations all of them and they shall spoil the
pomp of egypt and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed
i will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great
waters neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more nor the
hoofs of beasts trouble them
then will i make their waters deep and cause their rivers to
run like oil saith the lord god
when i shall make the land of egypt desolate and the country
shall be destitute of that whereof it was full when i shall smite all
them that dwell therein then shall they know that i am the lord
this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her the
daughters of the nations shall lament her they shall lament for her
even for egypt and for all her multitude saith the lord god
it came to pass also in the twelfth year in the fifteenth day
of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying
son of man wail for the multitude of egypt and cast them down even
her and the daughters of the famous nations unto the nether parts of
the earth with them that go down into the pit
whom dost thou pass in beauty go down and be thou laid with
the uncircumcised
they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the
sword she is delivered to the sword draw her and all her multitudes
the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst
of hell with them that help him they are gone down they lie
uncircumcised slain by the sword
asshur is there and all her company his graves are about him
all of them slain fallen by the sword  whose graves are set in
the sides of the pit and her company is round about her grave all of
them slain fallen by the sword which caused terror in the land of
the living
there is elam and all her multitude round about her grave all
of them slain fallen by the sword which are gone down uncircumcised
into the nether parts of the earth which caused their terror in the
land of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that go
down to the pit
they have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her
multitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised
slain by the sword though their terror was caused in the land of the
living yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the
pit he is put in the midst of them that be slain
there is meshech tubal and all her multitude her graves are
round about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword though
they caused their terror in the land of the living
and they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the
uncircumcised which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war
and they have laid their swords under their heads but their
iniquities shall be upon their bones though they were the terror of
the mighty in the land of the living
yea thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and
shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword
there is edom her kings and all her princes which with their
might are laid by them that were slain by the sword they shall lie
with the uncircumcised and with them that go down to the pit
there be the princes of the north all of them and all the
zidonians which are gone down with the slain with their terror they
are ashamed of their might and they lie uncircumcised with them that
be slain by the sword and bear their shame with them that go down to
the pit
pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his
multitude even pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword saith the
lord god
for i have caused my terror in the land of the living and he
shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are
slain with the sword even pharaoh and all his multitude saith the
lord god
again the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring
the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their
coasts and set him for their watchman  if when he seeth the
sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people
then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not
warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon
his own head
he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his
blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his
soul
but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet
and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person
from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will
i require at the watchmans hand
so thou o son of man i have set thee a watchman unto the house
of israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn
them from me
when i say unto the wicked o wicked man thou shalt surely die
if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked
man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thine
hand
nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it
if he do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou
hast delivered thy soul
therefore o thou son of man speak unto the house of israel
thus ye speak saying if our transgressions and our sins be upon us
and we pine away in them how should we then live   say unto
them as i live saith the lord god i have no pleasure in the death
of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn
ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of
israel   therefore thou son of man say unto the children of
thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him
in the day of his transgression as for the wickedness of the wicked
he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his
wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his
righteousness in the day that he sinneth
when i shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live if
he trust to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all his
righteousnesses shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he
hath committed he shall die for it
again when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die if he
turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right  if the
wicked restore the pledge give again that he had robbed walk in the
statutes of life without committing iniquity he shall surely live
he shall not die
none of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto
him he hath done that which is lawful and right he shall surely
live
yet the children of thy people say the way of the lord is not
equal but as for them their way is not equal
when the righteous turneth from his righteousness and
committeth iniquity he shall even die thereby
but if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which is
lawful and right he shall live thereby
yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal o ye house of
israel i will judge you every one after his ways
and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in the
tenth month in the fifth day of the month that one that had escaped
out of jerusalem came unto me saying the city is smitten
now the hand of the lord was upon me in the evening afore he
that was escaped came and had opened my mouth until he came to me in
the morning and my mouth was opened and i was no more dumb
then the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of
man they that inhabit those wastes of the land of israel speak
saying abraham was one and he inherited the land but we are many
the land is given us for inheritance
wherefore say unto them thus saith the lord god ye eat with
the blood and lift up your eyes toward your idols and shed blood
and shall ye possess the land   ye stand upon your sword ye
work abomination and ye defile every one his neighbours wife and
shall ye possess the land   say thou thus unto them thus saith
the lord god as i live surely they that are in the wastes shall fall
by the sword and him that is in the open field will i give to the
beasts to be devoured and they that be in the forts and in the caves
shall die of the pestilence
for i will lay the land most desolate and the pomp of her
strength shall cease and the mountains of israel shall be desolate
that none shall pass through
then shall they know that i am the lord when i have laid the
land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have
committed
also thou son of man the children of thy people still are
talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and
speak one to another every one to his brother saying come i pray
you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the lord
and they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sit
before thee as my people and they hear thy words but they will not
do them for with their mouth they shew much love but their heart
goeth after their covetousness
and lo thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that
hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they
hear thy words but they do them not
and when this cometh to pass lo it will come then shall
they know that a prophet hath been among them
and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
prophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say unto them
thus saith the lord god unto the shepherds woe be to the shepherds of
israel that do feed themselves should not the shepherds feed the
flocks   ye eat the fat and ye clothe you with the wool ye kill
them that are fed but ye feed not the flock
the diseased have ye not strengthened neither have ye healed
that which was sick neither have ye bound up that which was broken
neither have ye brought again that which was driven away neither have
ye sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have ye
ruled them
and they were scattered because there is no shepherd and they
became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered
my sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high
hill yea my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth and
none did search or seek after them
therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the lord  as i
live saith the lord god surely because my flock became a prey and
my flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no
shepherd neither did my shepherds search for my flock but the
shepherds fed themselves and fed not my flock  therefore o ye
shepherds hear the word of the lord  thus saith the lord god
behold i am against the shepherds and i will require my flock at
their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the flock neither
shall the shepherds feed themselves any more for i will deliver my
flock from their mouth that they may not be meat for them
for thus saith the lord god behold i even i will both search
my sheep and seek them out
as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among
his sheep that are scattered so will i seek out my sheep and will
deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the
cloudy and dark day
and i will bring them out from the people and gather them from
the countries and will bring them to their own land and feed them
upon the mountains of israel by the rivers and in all the inhabited
places of the country
i will feed them in a good pasture and upon the high mountains
of israel shall their fold be there shall they lie in a good fold
and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of israel
i will feed my flock and i will cause them to lie down saith
the lord god
i will seek that which was lost and bring again that which was
driven away and will bind up that which was broken and will
strengthen that which was sick but i will destroy the fat and the
strong i will feed them with judgment
and as for you o my flock thus saith the lord god behold i
judge between cattle and cattle between the rams and the he goats
seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good
pasture but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your
pastures and to have drunk of the deep waters but ye must foul the
residue with your feet   and as for my flock they eat that
which ye have trodden with your feet and they drink that which ye
have fouled with your feet
therefore thus saith the lord god unto them behold i even i
will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle
because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder and pushed
all the diseased with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad
therefore will i save my flock and they shall no more be a
prey and i will judge between cattle and cattle
and i will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feed
them even my servant david he shall feed them and he shall be their
shepherd
and i the lord will be their god and my servant david a prince
among them i the lord have spoken it
and i will make with them a covenant of peace and will cause
the evil beasts to cease out of the land and they shall dwell safely
in the wilderness and sleep in the woods
and i will make them and the places round about my hill a
blessing and i will cause the shower to come down in his season
there shall be showers of blessing
and the tree of the field shall yield her fruit and the earth
shall yield her increase and they shall be safe in their land and
shall know that i am the lord when i have broken the bands of their
yoke and delivered them out of the hand of those that served
themselves of them
and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen neither shall
the beast of the land devour them but they shall dwell safely and
none shall make them afraid
and i will raise up for them a plant of renown and they shall
be no more consumed with hunger in the land neither bear the shame of
the heathen any more
thus shall they know that i the lord their god am with them and
that they even the house of israel are my people saith the lord
god
and ye my flock the flock of my pasture are men and i am your
god saith the lord god
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of
man set thy face against mount seir and prophesy against it
and say unto it thus saith the lord god behold o mount seir i am
against thee and i will stretch out mine hand against thee and i
will make thee most desolate
i will lay thy cities waste and thou shalt be desolate and thou
shalt know that i am the lord
because thou hast had a perpetual hatred and hast shed the blood
of the children of israel by the force of the sword in the time of
their calamity in the time that their iniquity had an end
therefore as i live saith the lord god i will prepare thee unto
blood and blood shall pursue thee sith thou hast not hated blood
even blood shall pursue thee
thus will i make mount seir most desolate and cut off from it
him that passeth out and him that returneth
and i will fill his mountains with his slain men in thy hills
and in thy valleys and in all thy rivers shall they fall that are
slain with the sword
i will make thee perpetual desolations and thy cities shall not
return and ye shall know that i am the lord
because thou hast said these two nations and these two
countries shall be mine and we will possess it whereas the lord was
there  therefore as i live saith the lord god i will even do
according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hast
used out of thy hatred against them and i will make myself known
among them when i have judged thee
and thou shalt know that i am the lord and that i have heard
all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of
israel saying they are laid desolate they are given us to consume
thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me and have
multiplied your words against me i have heard them
thus saith the lord god when the whole earth rejoiceth i will
make thee desolate
as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of israel
because it was desolate so will i do unto thee thou shalt be
desolate o mount seir and all idumea even all of it and they shall
know that i am the lord
also thou son of man prophesy unto the mountains of israel and
say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord  thus
saith the lord god because the enemy hath said against you aha even
the ancient high places are ours in possession  therefore
prophesy and say thus saith the lord god because they have made you
desolate and swallowed you up on every side that ye might be a
possession unto the residue of the heathen and ye are taken up in the
lips of talkers and are an infamy of the people  therefore ye
mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the
lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the
valleys to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken
which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that
are round about  therefore thus saith the lord god surely in the
fire of my jealousy have i spoken against the residue of the heathen
and against all idumea which have appointed my land into their
possession with the joy of all their heart with despiteful minds to
cast it out for a prey
prophesy therefore concerning the land of israel and say unto
the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys
thus saith the lord god behold i have spoken in my jealousy and in
my fury because ye have borne the shame of the heathen
therefore thus saith the lord god i have lifted up mine hand surely
the heathen that are about you they shall bear their shame
but ye o mountains of israel ye shall shoot forth your
branches and yield your fruit to my people of israel for they are at
hand to come
for behold i am for you and i will turn unto you and ye shall
be tilled and sown  and i will multiply men upon you all the
house of israel even all of it and the cities shall be inhabited
and the wastes shall be builded  and i will multiply upon you
man and beast and they shall increase and bring fruit and i will
settle you after your old estates and will do better unto you than at
your beginnings and ye shall know that i am the lord
yea i will cause men to walk upon you even my people israel
and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance and
thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men
thus saith the lord god because they say unto you thou land
devourest up men and hast bereaved thy nations  therefore thou
shalt devour men no more neither bereave thy nations any more saith
the lord god
neither will i cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
heathen any more neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people
any more neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more saith
the lord god
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of
man when the house of israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it
by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as the
uncleanness of a removed woman
wherefore i poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had
shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had polluted
it  and i scattered them among the heathen and they were
dispersed through the countries according to their way and according
to their doings i judged them
and when they entered unto the heathen whither they went they
profaned my holy name when they said to them these are the people of
the lord and are gone forth out of his land
but i had pity for mine holy name which the house of israel had
profaned among the heathen whither they went
therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god
i do not this for your sakes o house of israel but for mine holy
names sake which ye have profaned among the heathen whither ye
went
and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the
heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen
shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be
sanctified in you before their eyes
for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out
of all countries and will bring you into your own land
then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be
clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i
cleanse you
a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put
within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh
and i will give you an heart of flesh
and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my
statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them
and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and
ye shall be my people and i will be your god
i will also save you from all your uncleannesses and i will
call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you
and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of
the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the
heathen
then shall ye remember your own evil ways and your doings that
were not good and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your
iniquities and for your abominations
not for your sakes do i this saith the lord god be it known
unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways o house of
israel
thus saith the lord god in the day that i shall have cleansed
you from all your iniquities i will also cause you to dwell in the
cities and the wastes shall be builded
and the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate
in the sight of all that passed by
and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like
the garden of eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are
become fenced and are inhabited
then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that i
the lord build the ruined places and plant that that was desolate i
the lord have spoken it and i will do it
thus saith the lord god i will yet for this be enquired of by
the house of israel to do it for them i will increase them with men
like a flock
as the holy flock as the flock of jerusalem in her solemn
feasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and
they shall know that i am the lord
the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the
spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which
was full of bones  and caused me to pass by them round about
and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they
were very dry
and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i
answered o lord god thou knowest
again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto
them o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord
thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause
breath to enter into you and ye shall live  and i will lay
sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with
skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that
i am the lord
so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there
was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone
to his bone
and when i beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came up upon
them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in
them
then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of
man and say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four
winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live
so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into
them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great
army
then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole
house of israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope
is lost we are cut off for our parts
therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god
behold o my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up
out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel
and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your
graves o my people and brought you up out of your graves  and
shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i shall place you
in your own land then shall ye know that i the lord have spoken it
and performed it saith the lord
the word of the lord came again unto me saying  moreover
thou son of man take thee one stick and write upon it for judah
and for the children of israel his companions then take another
stick and write upon it for joseph the stick of ephraim and for all
the house of israel his companions  and join them one to another
into one stick and they shall become one in thine hand
and when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee
saying wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these   say
unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the stick of
joseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of israel his
fellows and will put them with him even with the stick of judah and
make them one stick and they shall be one in mine hand
and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand
before their eyes
and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take
the children of israel from among the heathen whither they be gone
and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own
land  and i will make them one nation in the land upon the
mountains of israel and one king shall be king to them all and they
shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into two
kingdoms any more at all
neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols
nor with their detestable things nor with any of their
transgressions but i will save them out of all their dwellingplaces
wherein they have sinned and will cleanse them so shall they be my
people and i will be their god
and david my servant shall be king over them and they all shall
have one shepherd they shall also walk in my judgments and observe
my statutes and do them
and they shall dwell in the land that i have given unto jacob my
servant wherein your fathers have dwelt and they shall dwell
therein even they and their children and their childrens children
for ever and my servant david shall be their prince for ever
moreover i will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be
an everlasting covenant with them and i will place them and multiply
them and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore
my tabernacle also shall be with them yea i will be their god
and they shall be my people
and the heathen shall know that i the lord do sanctify israel
when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore
and the word of the lord came unto me saying  son of man
set thy face against gog the land of magog the chief prince of
meshech and tubal and prophesy against him  and say thus saith
the lord god behold i am against thee o gog the chief prince of
meshech and tubal  and i will turn thee back and put hooks into
thy jaws and i will bring thee forth and all thine army horses and
horsemen all of them clothed with all sorts of armour even a great
company with bucklers and shields all of them handling swords
persia ethiopia and libya with them all of them with shield and
helmet  gomer and all his bands the house of togarmah of the
north quarters and all his bands and many people with thee
be thou prepared and prepare for thyself thou and all thy
company that are assembled unto thee and be thou a guard unto them
after many days thou shalt be visited in the latter years thou
shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword and is
gathered out of many people against the mountains of israel which
have been always waste but it is brought forth out of the nations
and they shall dwell safely all of them
thou shalt ascend and come like a storm thou shalt be like a
cloud to cover the land thou and all thy bands and many people with
thee
thus saith the lord god it shall also come to pass that at the
same time shall things come into thy mind and thou shalt think an
evil thought  and thou shalt say i will go up to the land of
unwalled villages i will go to them that are at rest that dwell
safely all of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars
nor gates  to take a spoil and to take a prey to turn thine
hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited and upon the
people that are gathered out of the nations which have gotten cattle
and goods that dwell in the midst of the land
sheba and dedan and the merchants of tarshish with all the
young lions thereof shall say unto thee art thou come to take a
spoil hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey to carry away
silver and gold to take away cattle and goods to take a great spoil
therefore son of man prophesy and say unto gog thus saith the
lord god in that day when my people of israel dwelleth safely shalt
thou not know it   and thou shalt come from thy place out of the
north parts thou and many people with thee all of them riding upon
horses a great company and a mighty army  and thou shalt come
up against my people of israel as a cloud to cover the land it shall
be in the latter days and i will bring thee against my land that the
heathen may know me when i shall be sanctified in thee o gog before
their eyes
thus saith the lord god art thou he of whom i have spoken in
old time by my servants the prophets of israel which prophesied in
those days many years that i would bring thee against them   and
it shall come to pass at the same time when gog shall come against the
land of israel saith the lord god that my fury shall come up in my
face
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have i spoken
surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of
israel  so that the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the
heaven and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that
creep upon the earth and all the men that are upon the face of the
earth shall shake at my presence and the mountains shall be thrown
down and the steep places shall fall and every wall shall fall to
the ground
and i will call for a sword against him throughout all my
mountains saith the lord god every mans sword shall be against his
brother
and i will plead against him with pestilence and with blood and
i will rain upon him and upon his bands and upon the many people
that are with him an overflowing rain and great hailstones fire
and brimstone
thus will i magnify myself and sanctify myself and i will be
known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that i am the
lord
therefore thou son of man prophesy against gog and say thus
saith the lord god behold i am against thee o gog the chief prince
of meshech and tubal  and i will turn thee back and leave but
the sixth part of thee and will cause thee to come up from the north
parts and will bring thee upon the mountains of israel  and i
will smite thy bow out of thy left hand and will cause thine arrows
to fall out of thy right hand
thou shalt fall upon the mountains of israel thou and all thy
bands and the people that is with thee i will give thee unto the
ravenous birds of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be
devoured
thou shalt fall upon the open field for i have spoken it saith
the lord god
and i will send a fire on magog and among them that dwell
carelessly in the isles and they shall know that i am the lord
so will i make my holy name known in the midst of my people
israel and i will not let them pollute my holy name any more and the
heathen shall know that i am the lord the holy one in israel
behold it is come and it is done saith the lord god this is
the day whereof i have spoken
and they that dwell in the cities of israel shall go forth and
shall set on fire and burn the weapons both the shields and the
bucklers the bows and the arrows and the handstaves and the spears
and they shall burn them with fire seven years  so that they
shall take no wood out of the field neither cut down any out of the
forests for they shall burn the weapons with fire and they shall
spoil those that spoiled them and rob those that robbed them saith
the lord god
and it shall come to pass in that day that i will give unto gog
a place there of graves in israel the valley of the passengers on the
east of the sea and it shall stop the noses of the passengers and
there shall they bury gog and all his multitude and they shall call
it the valley of hamongog
and seven months shall the house of israel be burying of them
that they may cleanse the land
yea all the people of the land shall bury them and it shall be
to them a renown the day that i shall be glorified saith the lord
god
and they shall sever out men of continual employment passing
through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon
the face of the earth to cleanse it after the end of seven months
shall they search
and the passengers that pass through the land when any seeth a
mans bone then shall he set up a sign by it till the buriers have
buried it in the valley of hamongog
and also the name of the city shall be hamonah thus shall they
cleanse the land
and thou son of man thus saith the lord god speak unto every
feathered fowl and to every beast of the field assemble yourselves
and come gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that i do
sacrifice for you even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of
israel that ye may eat flesh and drink blood
ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the
princes of the earth of rams of lambs and of goats of bullocks
all of them fatlings of bashan
and ye shall eat fat till ye be full and drink blood till ye be
drunken of my sacrifice which i have sacrificed for you
thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots
with mighty men and with all men of war saith the lord god
and i will set my glory among the heathen and all the heathen
shall see my judgment that i have executed and my hand that i have
laid upon them
so the house of israel shall know that i am the lord their god
from that day and forward
and the heathen shall know that the house of israel went into
captivity for their iniquity because they trespassed against me
therefore hid i my face from them and gave them into the hand of
their enemies so fell they all by the sword
according to their uncleanness and according to their
transgressions have i done unto them and hid my face from them
therefore thus saith the lord god now will i bring again the
captivity of jacob and have mercy upon the whole house of israel and
will be jealous for my holy name  after that they have borne
their shame and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed
against me when they dwelt safely in their land and none made them
afraid
when i have brought them again from the people and gathered
them out of their enemies lands and am sanctified in them in the
sight of many nations  then shall they know that i am the lord
their god which caused them to be led into captivity among the
heathen but i have gathered them unto their own land and have left
none of them any more there
neither will i hide my face any more from them for i have
poured out my spirit upon the house of israel saith the lord god
in the five and twentieth year of our captivity in the beginning
of the year in the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year
after that the city was smitten in the selfsame day the hand of the
lord was upon me and brought me thither
in the visions of god brought he me into the land of israel and
set me upon a very high mountain by which was as the frame of a city
on the south
and he brought me thither and behold there was a man whose
appearance was like the appearance of brass with a line of flax in
his hand and a measuring reed and he stood in the gate
and the man said unto me son of man behold with thine eyes and
hear with thine ears and set thine heart upon all that i shall shew
thee for to the intent that i might shew them unto thee art thou

and without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in
the inner court which was at the side of the north gate and their

and he said unto me this chamber whose prospect is toward the
south is for the priests the keepers of the charge of the house
and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
priests the keepers of the charge of the altar these are the sons of
zadok among the sons of levi which come near to the lord to minister

then went he inward and measured the post of the door two
cubits and the door six cubits and the breadth of the door seven
cubits
so he measured the length thereof twenty cubits and the
breadth twenty cubits before the temple and he said unto me this
is the most holy place
after he measured the wall of the house six cubits and the
breadth of every side chamber four cubits round about the house on
every side
and the side chambers were three one over another and thirty in
order and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the
side chambers round about that they might have hold but they had not
hold in the wall of the house
and there was an enlarging and a winding about still upward to
the side chambers for the winding about of the house went still
upward round about the house therefore the breadth of the house was
still upward and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest
by the midst
i saw also the height of the house round about the foundations
of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits
the thickness of the wall which was for the side chamber
without was five cubits and that which was left was the place of the
side chambers that were within
and between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round
about the house on every side
and the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that
was left one door toward the north and another door toward the
south and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits
round about
now the building that was before the separate place at the end
toward the west was seventy cubits broad and the wall of the building
was five cubits thick round about and the length thereof ninety
cubits
so he measured the house an hundred cubits long and the
separate place and the building with the walls thereof an hundred
cubits long  also the breadth of the face of the house and of
the separate place toward the east an hundred cubits
and he measured the length of the building over against the
separate place which was behind it and the galleries thereof on the
one side and on the other side an hundred cubits with the inner
temple and the porches of the court  the door posts and the
narrow windows and the galleries round about on their three stories
over against the door cieled with wood round about and from the
ground up to the windows and the windows were covered  to that
above the door even unto the inner house and without and by all the
wall round about within and without by measure
and it was made with cherubims and palm trees so that a palm
tree was between a cherub and a cherub and every cherub had two
faces  so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the
one side and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the
other side it was made through all the house round about
from the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm

sanctuary the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other
the altar of wood was three cubits high and the length thereof
two cubits and the corners thereof and the length thereof and the
walls thereof were of wood and he said unto me this is the table
that is before the lord
and the temple and the sanctuary had two doors
and the doors had two leaves apiece two turning leaves two
leaves for the one door and two leaves for the other door

were thick planks upon the face of the porch without
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and

then he brought me forth into the utter court the way toward the
north and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the
separate place and which was before the building toward the north
before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door and
the breadth was fifty cubits
over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court
and over against the pavement which was for the utter court was
gallery against gallery in three stories
and before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward
a way of one cubit and their doors toward the north
now the upper chambers were shorter for the galleries were
higher than these than the lower and than the middlemost of the
building
for they were in three stories but had not pillars as the
pillars of the courts therefore the building was straitened more than
the lowest and the middlemost from the ground
and the wall that was without over against the chambers toward
the utter court on the forepart of the chambers the length thereof
was fifty cubits
for the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was
fifty cubits and lo before the temple were an hundred cubits
and from under these chambers was the entry on the east side as
one goeth into them from the utter court
the chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court
toward the east over against the separate place and over against the
building
and the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers
which were toward the north as long as they and as broad as they
and all their goings out were both according to their fashions and
according to their doors
and according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the
south was a door in the head of the way even the way directly before
the wall toward the east as one entereth into them
then said he unto me the north chambers and the south chambers
which are before the separate place they be holy chambers where the
priests that approach unto the lord shall eat the most holy things
there shall they lay the most holy things and the meat offering and
the sin offering and the trespass offering for the place is holy
when the priests enter therein then shall they not go out of
the holy place into the utter court but there they shall lay their
garments wherein they minister for they are holy and shall put on
other garments and shall approach to those things which are for the
people
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house he
brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east
and measured it round about
he measured the east side with the measuring reed five hundred
reeds with the measuring reed round about
he measured the north side five hundred reeds with the
measuring reed round about
he measured the south side five hundred reeds with the
measuring reed
he turned about to the west side and measured five hundred
reeds with the measuring reed
he measured it by the four sides it had a wall round about
five hundred reeds long and five hundred broad to make a separation
between the sanctuary and the profane place
afterward he brought me to the gate even the gate that looketh
toward the east  and behold the glory of the god of israel came
from the way of the east and his voice was like a noise of many
waters and the earth shined with his glory
and it was according to the appearance of the vision which i saw
even according to the vision that i saw when i came to destroy the
city and the visions were like the vision that i saw by the river
chebar and i fell upon my face
and the glory of the lord came into the house by the way of the
gate whose prospect is toward the east
so the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court
and behold the glory of the lord filled the house
and i heard him speaking unto me out of the house and the man
stood by me
and he said unto me son of man the place of my throne and the
place of the soles of my feet where i will dwell in the midst of the
children of israel for ever and my holy name shall the house of
israel no more defile neither they nor their kings by their
whoredom nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places
in their setting of their threshold by my thresholds and their
post by my posts and the wall between me and them they have even
defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed
wherefore i have consumed them in mine anger
now let them put away their whoredom and the carcases of their
kings far from me and i will dwell in the midst of them for ever
thou son of man shew the house to the house of israel that
they may be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the
pattern
and if they be ashamed of all that they have done shew them the
form of the house and the fashion thereof and the goings out
thereof and the comings in thereof and all the forms thereof and
all the ordinances thereof and all the forms thereof and all the
laws thereof and write it in their sight that they may keep the
whole form thereof and all the ordinances thereof and do them
this is the law of the house upon the top of the mountain the
whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy behold this is
the law of the house
and these are the measures of the altar after the cubits the
cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth even the bottom shall be a
cubit and the breadth a cubit and the border thereof by the edge
thereof round about shall be a span and this shall be the higher
place of the altar
and from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle
shall be two cubits and the breadth one cubit and from the lesser
settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits and the
breadth one cubit
so the altar shall be four cubits and from the altar and upward
shall be four horns
and the altar shall be twelve cubits long twelve broad square
in the four squares thereof
and the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad
in the four squares thereof and the border about it shall be half a
cubit and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about and his stairs
shall look toward the east
and he said unto me son of man thus saith the lord god these
are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it to
offer burnt offerings thereon and to sprinkle blood thereon
and thou shalt give to the priests the levites that be of the
seed of zadok which approach unto me to minister unto me saith the
lord god a young bullock for a sin offering
and thou shalt take of the blood thereof and put it on the four
horns of it and on the four corners of the settle and upon the
border round about thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it
thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering and he
shall burn it in the appointed place of the house without the
sanctuary
and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats
without blemish for a sin offering and they shall cleanse the altar
as they did cleanse it with the bullock
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it thou shalt offer a
young bullock without blemish and a ram out of the flock without
blemish
and thou shalt offer them before the lord and the priests shall
cast salt upon them and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering
unto the lord
seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin
offering they shall also prepare a young bullock and a ram out of
the flock without blemish
seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it and they
shall consecrate themselves
and when these days are expired it shall be that upon the
eighth day and so forward the priests shall make your burnt
offerings upon the altar and your peace offerings and i will accept
you saith the lord god
then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward
sanctuary which looketh toward the east and it was shut
then said the lord unto me this gate shall be shut it shall not
be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the lord the god
of israel hath entered in by it therefore it shall be shut
it is for the prince the prince he shall sit in it to eat bread
before the lord he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate
and shall go out by the way of the same
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house
and i looked and behold the glory of the lord filled the house of
the lord and i fell upon my face
and the lord said unto me son of man mark well and behold with
thine eyes and hear with thine ears all that i say unto thee
concerning all the ordinances of the house of the lord and all the
laws thereof and mark well the entering in of the house with every
going forth of the sanctuary
and thou shalt say to the rebellious even to the house of
israel thus saith the lord god o ye house of israel let it suffice
you of all your abominations  in that ye have brought into my
sanctuary strangers uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in
flesh to be in my sanctuary to pollute it even my house when ye
offer my bread the fat and the blood and they have broken my
covenant because of all your abominations
and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things but ye have
set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves
thus saith the lord god no stranger uncircumcised in heart nor
uncircumcised in flesh shall enter into my sanctuary of any stranger
that is among the children of israel
and the levites that are gone away far from me when israel went
astray which went astray away from me after their idols they shall
even bear their iniquity
yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary having charge at
the gates of the house and ministering to the house they shall slay
the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people and they shall
stand before them to minister unto them
because they ministered unto them before their idols and caused
the house of israel to fall into iniquity therefore have i lifted up
mine hand against them saith the lord god and they shall bear their
iniquity
and they shall not come near unto me to do the office of a
priest unto me nor to come near to any of my holy things in the most
holy place but they shall bear their shame and their abominations
which they have committed
but i will make them keepers of the charge of the house for all
the service thereof and for all that shall be done therein
but the priests the levites the sons of zadok that kept the
charge of my sanctuary when the children of israel went astray from
me they shall come near to me to minister unto me and they shall
stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood saith the lord
god  they shall enter into my sanctuary and they shall come
near to my table to minister unto me and they shall keep my charge
and it shall come to pass that when they enter in at the gates
of the inner court they shall be clothed with linen garments and no
wool shall come upon them whiles they minister in the gates of the
inner court and within
they shall have linen bonnets upon their heads and shall have
linen breeches upon their loins they shall not gird themselves with
any thing that causeth sweat
and when they go forth into the utter court even into the utter
court to the people they shall put off their garments wherein they
ministered and lay them in the holy chambers and they shall put on
other garments and they shall not sanctify the people with their
garments
neither shall they shave their heads nor suffer their locks to
grow long they shall only poll their heads
neither shall any priest drink wine when they enter into the
inner court
neither shall they take for their wives a widow nor her that is
put away but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of
israel or a widow that had a priest before
and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy
and profane and cause them to discern between the unclean and the
clean
and in controversy they shall stand in judgment and they shall
judge it according to my judgments and they shall keep my laws and my
statutes in all mine assemblies and they shall hallow my sabbaths
and they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves but
for father or for mother or for son or for daughter for brother
or for sister that hath had no husband they may defile themselves
and after he is cleansed they shall reckon unto him seven days
and in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary unto the inner
court to minister in the sanctuary he shall offer his sin offering
saith the lord god
and it shall be unto them for an inheritance i am their
inheritance and ye shall give them no possession in israel i am
their possession
they shall eat the meat offering and the sin offering and the
trespass offering and every dedicated thing in israel shall be
theirs
and the first of all the firstfruits of all things and every
oblation of all of every sort of your oblations shall be the
priests ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough
that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house
the priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself
or torn whether it be fowl or beast
moreover when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance
ye shall offer an oblation unto the lord an holy portion of the land
the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds and
the breadth shall be ten thousand this shall be holy in all the
borders thereof round about
of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length
with five hundred in breadth square round about and fifty cubits

and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and
twenty thousand and the breadth of ten thousand and in it shall be
the sanctuary and the most holy place
the holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the
ministers of the sanctuary which shall come near to minister unto the
lord and it shall be a place for their houses and an holy place for
the sanctuary
and the five and twenty thousand of length and the ten thousand
of breadth shall also the levites the ministers of the house have
for themselves for a possession for twenty chambers
and ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
broad and five and twenty thousand long over against the oblation of
the holy portion it shall be for the whole house of israel
and a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the
other side of the oblation of the holy portion and of the possession
of the city before the oblation of the holy portion and before the

portions from the west border unto the east border
in the land shall be his possession in israel and my princes
shall no more oppress my people and the rest of the land shall they
give to the house of israel according to their tribes
thus saith the lord god let it suffice you o princes of israel
remove violence and spoil and execute judgment and justice take away
your exactions from my people saith the lord god
ye shall have just balances and a just ephah and a just bath
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure that the bath
may contain the tenth part of an homer and the ephah the tenth part
of an homer the measure thereof shall be after the homer
and the shekel shall be twenty gerahs twenty shekels five and
twenty shekels fifteen shekels shall be your maneh
this is the oblation that ye shall offer the sixth part of an
ephah of an homer of wheat and ye shall give the sixth part of an
ephah of an homer of barley  concerning the ordinance of oil
the bath of oil ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the
cor which is an homer of ten baths for ten baths are an homer
and one lamb out of the flock out of two hundred out of the fat
pastures of israel for a meat offering and for a burnt offering and
for peace offerings to make reconciliation for them saith the lord
god
all the people of the land shall give this oblation for the
prince in israel
and it shall be the princes part to give burnt offerings and
meat offerings and drink offerings in the feasts and in the new
moons and in the sabbaths in all solemnities of the house of israel
he shall prepare the sin offering and the meat offering and the
burnt offering and the peace offerings to make reconciliation for
the house of israel
thus saith the lord god in the first month in the first day of
the month thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish and
cleanse the sanctuary  and the priest shall take of the blood of
the sin offering and put it upon the posts of the house and upon the
four corners of the settle of the altar and upon the posts of the
gate of the inner court
and so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one
that erreth and for him that is simple so shall ye reconcile the
house
in the first month in the fourteenth day of the month ye shall
have the passover a feast of seven days unleavened bread shall be
eaten
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for
all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering
and seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to
the lord seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the
seven days and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering
and he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock
and an ephah for a ram and an hin of oil for an ephah
in the seventh month in the fifteenth day of the month shall
he do the like in the feast of the seven days according to the sin
offering according to the burnt offering and according to the meat
offering and according to the oil
thus saith the lord god the gate of the inner court that looketh
toward the east shall be shut the six working days but on the sabbath
it shall be opened and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened
and the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate
without and shall stand by the post of the gate and the priests
shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings and he shall
worship at the threshold of the gate then he shall go forth but the
gate shall not be shut until the evening
likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this
gate before the lord in the sabbaths and in the new moons
and the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the lord
in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram
without blemish
and the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram and the meat
offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give and an hin of oil
to an ephah
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock
without blemish and six lambs and a ram they shall be without
blemish
and he shall prepare a meat offering an ephah for a bullock and
an ephah for a ram and for the lambs according as his hand shall
attain unto and an hin of oil to an ephah
and when the prince shall enter he shall go in by the way of the
porch of that gate and he shall go forth by the way thereof
but when the people of the land shall come before the lord in the
solemn feasts he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to
worship shall go out by the way of the south gate and he that
entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the
north gate he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came
in but shall go forth over against it
and the prince in the midst of them when they go in shall go
in and when they go forth shall go forth
and in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall
be an ephah to a bullock and an ephah to a ram and to the lambs as
he is able to give and an hin of oil to an ephah
now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or
peace offerings voluntarily unto the lord one shall then open him the
gate that looketh toward the east and he shall prepare his burnt
offering and his peace offerings as he did on the sabbath day then
he shall go forth and after his going forth one shall shut the gate
thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the lord of a
lamb of the first year without blemish thou shalt prepare it every
morning
and thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning the
sixth part of an ephah and the third part of an hin of oil to temper
with the fine flour a meat offering continually by a perpetual
ordinance unto the lord
thus shall they prepare the lamb and the meat offering and the
oil every morning for a continual burnt offering
thus saith the lord god if the prince give a gift unto any of
his sons the inheritance thereof shall be his sons it shall be
their possession by inheritance
but if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants
then it shall be his to the year of liberty after it shall return to
the prince but his inheritance shall be his sons for them
moreover the prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance
by oppression to thrust them out of their possession but he shall
give his sons inheritance out of his own possession that my people be
not scattered every man from his possession
after he brought me through the entry which was at the side of
the gate into the holy chambers of the priests which looked toward
the north and behold there was a place on the two sides westward
then said he unto me this is the place where the priests shall
boil the trespass offering and the sin offering where they shall bake
the meat offering that they bear them not out into the utter court
to sanctify the people
then he brought me forth into the utter court and caused me to
pass by the four corners of the court and behold in every corner of
the court there was a court
in the four corners of the court there were courts joined of
forty cubits long and thirty broad these four corners were of one
measure
and there was a row of building round about in them round about
them four and it was made with boiling places under the rows round
about
then said he unto me these are the places of them that boil
where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the
people
afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house and
behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house
eastward for the forefront of the house stood toward the east and
the waters came down from under from the right side of the house at
the south side of the altar
then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward and led
me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh
eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right side
and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth
eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the
waters the waters were to the ankles
again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters
the waters were to the knees again he measured a thousand and
brought me through the waters were to the loins
afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that i could
not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river
that could not be passed over
and he said unto me son of man hast thou seen this then he
brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river
now when i had returned behold at the bank of the river were
very many trees on the one side and on the other
then said he unto me these waters issue out toward the east
country and go down into the desert and go into the sea which being
brought forth into the sea the waters shall be healed
and it shall come to pass that every thing that liveth which
moveth whithersoever the rivers shall come shall live and there
shall be a very great multitude of fish because these waters shall
come thither for they shall be healed and every thing shall live
whither the river cometh
and it shall come to pass that the fishers shall stand upon it
from engedi even unto eneglaim they shall be a place to spread forth
nets their fish shall be according to their kinds as the fish of the
great sea exceeding many
but the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not
be healed they shall be given to salt
and by the river upon the bank thereof on this side and on that
side shall grow all trees for meat whose leaf shall not fade
neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed it shall bring forth new
fruit according to his months because their waters they issued out of
the sanctuary and the fruit thereof shall be for meat and the leaf
thereof for medicine

the book of daniel
in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came
nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it
and the lord gave jehoiakim king of judah into his hand with part
of the vessels of the house of god which he carried into the land of
shinar to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the
treasure house of his god
and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that
he should bring certain of the children of israel and of the kings
seed and of the princes  children in whom was no blemish but
well favoured and skilful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge
and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in
the kings palace and whom they might teach the learning and the
tongue of the chaldeans
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the kings meat
and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that
at the end thereof they might stand before the king
now among these were of the children of judah daniel hananiah
mishael and azariah  unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave
names for he gave unto daniel the name of belteshazzar and to
hananiah of shadrach and to mishael of meshach and to azariah of
abednego
but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself
with the portion of the kings meat nor with the wine which he drank
therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not
defile himself
now god had brought daniel into favour and tender love with the
prince of the eunuchs
and the prince of the eunuchs said unto daniel i fear my lord
the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink for why should
he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your
sort then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king
then said daniel to melzar whom the prince of the eunuchs had
set over daniel hananiah mishael and azariah  prove thy
servants i beseech thee ten days and let them give us pulse to eat
and water to drink
then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the
countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the kings
meat and as thou seest deal with thy servants
so he consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days
and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and
fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the
kings meat
thus melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine
that they should drink and gave them pulse
as for these four children god gave them knowledge and skill in
all learning and wisdom and daniel had understanding in all visions
and dreams
now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring
them in then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before
nebuchadnezzar
and the king communed with them and among them all was found
none like daniel hananiah mishael and azariah therefore stood they
before the king
and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king
enquired of them he found them ten times better than all the
magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm
and daniel continued even unto the first year of king cyrus
and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar
nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams wherewith his spirit was troubled and
his sleep brake from him
then the king commanded to call the magicians and the
astrologers and the sorcerers and the chaldeans for to shew the
king his dreams so they came and stood before the king
and the king said unto them i have dreamed a dream and my spirit
was troubled to know the dream
then spake the chaldeans to the king in syriack o king live for
ever tell thy servants the dream and we will shew the
interpretation
the king answered and said to the chaldeans the thing is gone
from me if ye will not make known unto me the dream with the
interpretation thereof ye shall be cut in pieces and your houses
shall be made a dunghill
but if ye shew the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shall
receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour therefore shew me
the dream and the interpretation thereof
they answered again and said let the king tell his servants the
dream and we will shew the interpretation of it
the king answered and said i know of certainty that ye would gain
the time because ye see the thing is gone from me
but if ye will not make known unto me the dream there is but one
decree for you for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak
before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and
i shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof
the chaldeans answered before the king and said there is not a
man upon the earth that can shew the kings matter therefore there is
no king lord nor ruler that asked such things at any magician or
astrologer or chaldean
and it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none
other that can shew it before the king except the gods whose
dwelling is not with flesh
for this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded
to destroy all the wise men of babylon
and the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain and
they sought daniel and his fellows to be slain
then daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to arioch the
captain of the kings guard which was gone forth to slay the wise men
of babylon  he answered and said to arioch the kings captain
why is the decree so hasty from the king then arioch made the thing
known to daniel
then daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give
him time and that he would shew the king the interpretation
then daniel went to his house and made the thing known to
hananiah mishael and azariah his companions  that they would
desire mercies of the god of heaven concerning this secret that
daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men
of babylon
then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a night vision then
daniel blessed the god of heaven
daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god for ever and
ever for wisdom and might are his  and he changeth the times and
the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom
unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding  he
revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the
darkness and the light dwelleth with him
i thank thee and praise thee o thou god of my fathers who hast
given me wisdom and might and hast made known unto me now what we
desired of thee for thou hast now made known unto us the kings
matter
therefore daniel went in unto arioch whom the king had ordained
to destroy the wise men of babylon he went and said thus unto him
destroy not the wise men of babylon bring me in before the king and
i will shew unto the king the interpretation
then arioch brought in daniel before the king in haste and said
thus unto him i have found a man of the captives of judah that will
make known unto the king the interpretation
the king answered and said to daniel whose name was
belteshazzar art thou able to make known unto me the dream which i
have seen and the interpretation thereof   daniel answered in
the presence of the king and said the secret which the king hath
demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers the magicians the
soothsayers shew unto the king  but there is a god in heaven
that revealeth secrets and maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzar
what shall be in the latter days thy dream and the visions of thy
head upon thy bed are these  as for thee o king thy thoughts
came into thy mind upon thy bed what should come to pass hereafter
and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to
pass
but as for me this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom
that i have more than any living but for their sakes that shall make
known the interpretation to the king and that thou mightest know the
thoughts of thy heart
thou o king sawest and behold a great image this great image
whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form
thereof was terrible
this images head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of
silver his belly and his thighs of brass  his legs of iron his
feet part of iron and part of clay
thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which
smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and brake
them to pieces
then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold
broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer
threshingfloors and the wind carried them away that no place was
found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great
mountain and filled the whole earth
this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof
before the king
thou o king art a king of kings for the god of heaven hath
given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory
and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the
field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and
hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold
and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and
another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the
earth
and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron forasmuch as iron
breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh
all these shall it break in pieces and bruise
and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potters clay
and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in
it of the strength of the iron forasmuch as thou sawest the iron
mixed with miry clay
and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay
so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken
and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall
mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one
to another even as iron is not mixed with clay
and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a
kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be
left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all
these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever
forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
mountain without hands and that it brake in pieces the iron the
brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made
known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is
certain and the interpretation thereof sure
then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped
daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet
odours unto him
the king answered unto daniel and said of a truth it is that
your god is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of
secrets seeing thou couldest reveal this secret
then the king made daniel a great man and gave him many great
gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of babylon and
chief of the governors over all the wise men of babylon
then daniel requested of the king and he set shadrach meshach
and abednego over the affairs of the province of babylon but daniel
sat in the gate of the king
nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was
threescore cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits he set it up in
the plain of dura in the province of babylon
then nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes
the governors and the captains the judges the treasurers the
counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to
come to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had
set up
then the princes the governors and captains the judges the
treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the
provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image
that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the
image that nebuchadnezzar had set up
then an herald cried aloud to you it is commanded o people
nations and languages  that at what time ye hear the sound of the
cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of
musick ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar
the king hath set up  and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth
shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace
therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the
cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and all kinds of musick all
the people the nations and the languages fell down and worshipped
the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near and accused
the jews
they spake and said to the king nebuchadnezzar o king live for
ever
thou o king hast made a decree that every man that shall hear
the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer
and all kinds of musick shall fall down and worship the golden image
and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth that he should be
cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace
there are certain jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the
province of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego these men o
king have not regarded thee they serve not thy gods nor worship the
golden image which thou hast set up
then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring
shadrach meshach and abednego then they brought these men before
the king
nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true o shadrach
meshach and abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden
image which i have set up   now if ye be ready that at what time
ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and
dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the image
which i have made well but if ye worship not ye shall be cast the
same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that
god that shall deliver you out of my hands   shadrach meshach
and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are
not careful to answer thee in this matter
if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the
burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand o
king
but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve
thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up
then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visage
was changed against shadrach meshach and abednego therefore he
spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times
more than it was wont to be heated
and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to
bind shadrach meshach and abednego and to cast them into the
burning fiery furnace
then these men were bound in their coats their hosen and their
hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the
burning fiery furnace
therefore because the kings commandment was urgent and the
furnace exceeding hot the flames of the fire slew those men that took
up shadrach meshach and abednego
and these three men shadrach meshach and abednego fell down
bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace
then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied and rose up in haste
and spake and said unto his counsellors did not we cast three men
bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the
king true o king
he answered and said lo i see four men loose walking in the
midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth
is like the son of god
then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery
furnace and spake and said shadrach meshach and abednego ye
servants of the most high god come forth and come hither then
shadrach meshach and abednego came forth of the midst of the fire
and the princes governors and captains and the kings
counsellors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies
the fire had no power nor was an hair of their head singed neither
were their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them
then nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of
shadrach meshach and abednego who hath sent his angel and
delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the
kings word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor
worship any god except their own god
therefore i make a decree that every people nation and
language which speak any thing amiss against the god of shadrach
meshach and abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall
be made a dunghill because there is no other god that can deliver
after this sort
then the king promoted shadrach meshach and abednego in the
province of babylon
nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people nations and languages
that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you
i thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high god
hath wrought toward me
how great are his signs and how mighty are his wonders his
kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion is from generation
to generation
i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house and flourishing in my
palace  i saw a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts upon
my bed and the visions of my head troubled me
therefore made i a decree to bring in all the wise men of babylon
before me that they might make known unto me the interpretation of
the dream
then came in the magicians the astrologers the chaldeans and
the soothsayers and i told the dream before them but they did not
make known unto me the interpretation thereof
but at the last daniel came in before me whose name was
belteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom is the
spirit of the holy gods and before him i told the dream saying
o belteshazzar master of the magicians because i know that the
spirit of the holy gods is in thee and no secret troubleth thee tell
me the visions of my dream that i have seen and the interpretation
thereof
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed i saw and behold a
tree in the midst of the earth and the height thereof was great
the tree grew and was strong and the height thereof reached
unto heaven and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth
the leaves thereof were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it
was meat for all the beasts of the field had shadow under it and the
fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof and all flesh was fed
of it
i saw in the visions of my head upon my bed and behold a
watcher and an holy one came down from heaven  he cried aloud
and said thus hew down the tree and cut off his branches shake off
his leaves and scatter his fruit let the beasts get away from under
it and the fowls from his branches  nevertheless leave the stump
of his roots in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the
tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven
and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth
let his heart be changed from mans and let a beasts heart be given
unto him and let seven times pass over him
this matter is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by
the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know that
the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to
whomsoever he will and setteth up over it the basest of men
this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen now thou o
belteshazzar declare the interpretation thereof forasmuch as all the
wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the
interpretation but thou art able for the spirit of the holy gods is
in thee
then daniel whose name was belteshazzar was astonied for one
hour and his thoughts troubled him the king spake and said
belteshazzar let not the dream or the interpretation thereof
trouble thee belteshazzar answered and said my lord the dream be to
them that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies
the tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose
height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the
earth  whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and in
it was meat for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt and
upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation
it is thou o king that art grown and become strong for thy
greatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thy dominion to the
end of the earth
and whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down
from heaven and saying hew the tree down and destroy it yet leave
the stump of the roots thereof in the earth even with a band of iron
and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with
the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts of the
field till seven times pass over him  this is the
interpretation o king and this is the decree of the most high which
is come upon my lord the king  that they shall drive thee from
men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they
shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet thee with the
dew of heaven and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know
that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to
whomsoever he will
and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots
thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after that thou shalt have known
that the heavens do rule
wherefore o king let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and
break off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by shewing
mercy to the poor if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity
all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar
at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
kingdom of babylon
the king spake and said is not this great babylon that i have
built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for
the honour of my majesty   while the word was in the kings
mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying o king nebuchadnezzar
to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee
and they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be
with the beasts of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as
oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the
most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he
will
the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar and he
was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet
with the dew of heaven till his hairs were grown like eagles
feathers and his nails like birds claws
and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes
unto heaven and mine understanding returned unto me and i blessed
the most high and i praised and honoured him that liveth for ever
whose dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from
generation to generation  and all the inhabitants of the earth
are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army
of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay
his hand or say unto him what doest thou   at the same time my
reason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom mine honour
and brightness returned unto me and my counsellors and my lords
sought unto me and i was established in my kingdom and excellent
majesty was added unto me
now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the king of
heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those
that walk in pride he is able to abase
belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords
and drank wine before the thousand
belshazzar whiles he tasted the wine commanded to bring the
golden and silver vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar had taken
out of the temple which was in jerusalem that the king and his
princes his wives and his concubines might drink therein
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the
temple of the house of god which was at jerusalem and the king and
his princes his wives and his concubines drank in them
they drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver of
brass of iron of wood and of stone
in the same hour came forth fingers of a mans hand and wrote
over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the
kings palace and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote
then the kings countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled
him so that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote
one against another
the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers the chaldeans
and the soothsayers and the king spake and said to the wise men of
babylon whosoever shall read this writing and shew me the
interpretation thereof shall be clothed with scarlet and have a
chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the
kingdom
then came in all the kings wise men but they could not read the
writing nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof
then was king belshazzar greatly troubled and his countenance was
changed in him and his lords were astonied
now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords
came into the banquet house and the queen spake and said o king
live for ever let not thy thoughts trouble thee nor let thy
countenance be changed  there is a man in thy kingdom in whom is
the spirit of the holy gods and in the days of thy father light and
understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in
him whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father the king i say thy
father made master of the magicians astrologers chaldeans and
soothsayers  forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and
understanding interpreting of dreams and shewing of hard sentences
and dissolving of doubts were found in the same daniel whom the king
named belteshazzar now let daniel be called and he will shew the
interpretation
then was daniel brought in before the king and the king spake
and said unto daniel art thou that daniel which art of the children
of the captivity of judah whom the king my father brought out of
jewry   i have even heard of thee that the spirit of the gods is
in thee and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is
found in thee
and now the wise men the astrologers have been brought in
before me that they should read this writing and make known unto me
the interpretation thereof but they could not shew the interpretation
of the thing  and i have heard of thee that thou canst make
interpretations and dissolve doubts now if thou canst read the
writing and make known to me the interpretation thereof thou shalt
be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about thy neck and
shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom
then daniel answered and said before the king let thy gifts be
to thyself and give thy rewards to another yet i will read the
writing unto the king and make known to him the interpretation
o thou king the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father a
kingdom and majesty and glory and honour  and for the majesty
that he gave him all people nations and languages trembled and
feared before him whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept
alive and whom he would he set up and whom he would he put down
but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride
he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from
him  and he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was
made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses they
fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of
heaven till he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom of
men and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will
and thou his son o belshazzar hast not humbled thine heart
though thou knewest all this  but hast lifted up thyself against
the lord of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house
before thee and thou and thy lords thy wives and thy concubines
have drunk wine in them and thou hast praised the gods of silver and
gold of brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear nor
know and the god in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thy
ways hast thou not glorified  then was the part of the hand sent
from him and this writing was written
and this is the writing that was written mene mene tekel
upharsin
this is the interpretation of the thing mene god hath numbered
thy kingdom and finished it
tekel thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting
peres thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and
persians
then commanded belshazzar and they clothed daniel with scarlet
and put a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamation
concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom
in that night was belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slain
and darius the median took the kingdom being about threescore
and two years old
it pleased darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty
princes which should be over the whole kingdom  and over these
three presidents of whom daniel was first that the princes might
give accounts unto them and the king should have no damage
then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes
because an excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to set
him over the whole realm
then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against
daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor
fault forasmuch as he was faithful neither was there any error or
fault found in him
then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this
daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his god
then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king
and said thus unto him king darius live for ever
all the presidents of the kingdom the governors and the princes
the counsellors and the captains have consulted together to
establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whosoever
shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days save of thee
o king he shall be cast into the den of lions
now o king establish the decree and sign the writing that it
be not changed according to the law of the medes and persians which
altereth not
wherefore king darius signed the writing and the decree
now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into
his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward jerusalem
he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave
thanks before his god as he did aforetime
then these men assembled and found daniel praying and making
supplication before his god
then they came near and spake before the king concerning the
kings decree hast thou not signed a decree that every man that
shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days save of
thee o king shall be cast into the den of lions the king answered
and said the thing is true according to the law of the medes and
persians which altereth not
then answered they and said before the king that daniel which
is of the children of the captivity of judah regardeth not thee o
king nor the decree that thou hast signed but maketh his petition
three times a day
then the king when he heard these words was sore displeased
with himself and set his heart on daniel to deliver him and he
laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him
then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king
know o king that the law of the medes and persians is that no
decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed
then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him
into the den of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel thy
god whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and
the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his
lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel
then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting
neither were instruments of musick brought before him and his sleep
went from him
then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste
unto the den of lions
and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice
unto daniel and the king spake and said to daniel o daniel servant
of the living god is thy god whom thou servest continually able to
deliver thee from the lions   then said daniel unto the king o
king live for ever
my god hath sent his angel and hath shut the lions mouths that
they have not hurt me forasmuch as before him innocency was found in
me and also before thee o king have i done no hurt
then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that
they should take daniel up out of the den so daniel was taken up out
of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he
believed in his god
and the king commanded and they brought those men which had
accused daniel and they cast them into the den of lions them their
children and their wives and the lions had the mastery of them and
brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the
den
then king darius wrote unto all people nations and languages
that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you
i make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble
and fear before the god of daniel for he is the living god and
stedfast for ever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
and his dominion shall be even unto the end
he delivereth and rescueth and he worketh signs and wonders in
heaven and in earth who hath delivered daniel from the power of the
lions
so this daniel prospered in the reign of darius and in the reign
of cyrus the persian
in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel had a dream
and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and
told the sum of the matters
daniel spake and said i saw in my vision by night and behold
the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea
and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from
another
the first was like a lion and had eagles wings i beheld till
the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth
and made stand upon the feet as a man and a mans heart was given to
it
and behold another beast a second like to a bear and it raised
up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it
between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arise devour
much flesh
after this i beheld and lo another like a leopard which had
upon the back of it four wings of a fowl the beast had also four
heads and dominion was given to it
after this i saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast
dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron
teeth it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with
the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were
before it and it had ten horns
i considered the horns and behold there came up among them
another little horn before whom there were three of the first horns
plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like the
eyes of man and a mouth speaking great things
i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days
did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head
like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his
wheels as burning fire
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand
thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand
stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened
i beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the
horn spake i beheld even till the beast was slain and his body
destroyed and given to the burning flame
as concerning the rest of the beasts they had their dominion
taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time
i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man
came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and
they brought him near before him
and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that
all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is
an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom
that which shall not be destroyed
i daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body and
the visions of my head troubled me
i came near unto one of them that stood by and asked him the
truth of all this so he told me and made me know the interpretation
of the things
these great beasts which are four are four kings which shall
arise out of the earth
but the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and
possess the kingdom for ever even for ever and ever
then i would know the truth of the fourth beast which was
diverse from all the others exceeding dreadful whose teeth were of
iron and his nails of brass which devoured brake in pieces and
stamped the residue with his feet  and of the ten horns that were
in his head and of the other which came up and before whom three
fell even of that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spake very
great things whose look was more stout than his fellows
i beheld and the same horn made war with the saints and
prevailed against them  until the ancient of days came and
judgment was given to the saints of the most high and the time came
that the saints possessed the kingdom
thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon
earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the
whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces
and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall
arise and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse from
the first and he shall subdue three kings
and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall
wear out the saints of the most high and think to change times and
laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and
the dividing of time
but the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his
dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end
and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom
under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of
the most high whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all
dominions shall serve and obey him
hitherto is the end of the matter as for me daniel my
cogitations much troubled me and my countenance changed in me but i
kept the matter in my heart
in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a vision
appeared unto me even unto me daniel after that which appeared unto
me at the first
and i saw in a vision and it came to pass when i saw that i was
at shushan in the palace which is in the province of elam and i saw
in a vision and i was by the river of ulai
then i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold there stood
before the river a ram which had two horns and the two horns were
high but one was higher than the other and the higher came up last
i saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward so
that no beasts might stand before him neither was there any that
could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will and
became great
and as i was considering behold an he goat came from the west on
the face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and the goat
had a notable horn between his eyes
and he came to the ram that had two horns which i had seen
standing before the river and ran unto him in the fury of his power
and i saw him come close unto the ram and he was moved with
choler against him and smote the ram and brake his two horns and
there was no power in the ram to stand before him but he cast him
down to the ground and stamped upon him and there was none that
could deliver the ram out of his hand
therefore the he goat waxed very great and when he was strong
the great horn was broken and for it came up four notable ones toward
the four winds of heaven
and out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed
exceeding great toward the south and toward the east and toward the
pleasant land
and it waxed great even to the host of heaven and it cast down
some of the host and of the stars to the ground and stamped upon
them
yea he magnified himself even to the prince of the host and by
him the daily sacrifice was taken away and the place of the sanctuary
was cast down
and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason
of transgression and it cast down the truth to the ground and it
practised and prospered
then i heard one saint speaking and another saint said unto that
certain saint which spake how long shall be the vision concerning the
daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both the
sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot   and he said
unto me unto two thousand and three hundred days then shall the
sanctuary be cleansed
and it came to pass when i even i daniel had seen the vision
and sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me as the
appearance of a man
and i heard a mans voice between the banks of ulai which
called and said gabriel make this man to understand the vision
so he came near where i stood and when he came i was afraid
and fell upon my face but he said unto me understand o son of man
for at the time of the end shall be the vision
now as he was speaking with me i was in a deep sleep on my face
toward the ground but he touched me and set me upright
and he said behold i will make thee know what shall be in the
last end of the indignation for at the time appointed the end shall
be
the ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of media
and persia
and the rough goat is the king of grecia and the great horn that
is between his eyes is the first king
now that being broken whereas four stood up for it four
kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation but not in his power
and in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors
are come to the full a king of fierce countenance and understanding
dark sentences shall stand up
and his power shall be mighty but not by his own power and he
shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practise and shall
destroy the mighty and the holy people
and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
his hand and he shall magnify himself in his heart and by peace
shall destroy many he shall also stand up against the prince of
princes but he shall be broken without hand
and the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is
true wherefore shut thou up the vision for it shall be for many
days
and i daniel fainted and was sick certain days afterward i rose
up and did the kings business and i was astonished at the vision
but none understood it
in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus of the seed of
the medes which was made king over the realm of the chaldeans  in
the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the number of
the years whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet
that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of
jerusalem
and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and
supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes  and i
prayed unto the lord my god and made my confession and said o lord
the great and dreadful god keeping the covenant and mercy to them
that love him and to them that keep his commandments  we have
sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have
rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments
neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which
spake in thy name to our kings our princes and our fathers and to
all the people of the land
o lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion
of faces as at this day to the men of judah and to the inhabitants
of jerusalem and unto all israel that are near and that are far
off through all the countries whither thou hast driven them because
of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee
o lord to us belongeth confusion of face to our kings to our
princes and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee
to the lord our god belong mercies and forgivenesses though we
have rebelled against him  neither have we obeyed the voice of
the lord our god to walk in his laws which he set before us by his
servants the prophets
yea all israel have transgressed thy law even by departing
that they might not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured upon
us and the oath that is written in the law of moses the servant of
god because we have sinned against him
and he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us and
against our judges that judged us by bringing upon us a great evil
for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon
jerusalem
as it is written in the law of moses all this evil is come upon
us yet made we not our prayer before the lord our god that we might
turn from our iniquities and understand thy truth
therefore hath the lord watched upon the evil and brought it
upon us for the lord our god is righteous in all his works which he
doeth for we obeyed not his voice
and now o lord our god that hast brought thy people forth out
of the land of egypt with a mighty hand and hast gotten thee renown
as at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly
o lord according to all thy righteousness i beseech thee let
thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city jerusalem thy
holy mountain because for our sins and for the iniquities of our
fathers jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that
are about us
now therefore o our god hear the prayer of thy servant and his
supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is
desolate for the lords sake
o my god incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and
behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for
we do not present our supplications before thee for our
righteousnesses but for thy great mercies
o lord hear o lord forgive o lord hearken and do defer not
for thine own sake o my god for thy city and thy people are called
by thy name
and whiles i was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and
the sin of my people israel and presenting my supplication before the
lord my god for the holy mountain of my god  yea whiles i was
speaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i had seen in the
vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about
the time of the evening oblation
and he informed me and talked with me and said o daniel i am
now come forth to give thee skill and understanding
at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth
and i am come to shew thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore
understand the matter and consider the vision
seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to
make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting
righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint
the most holy
know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the
commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the
prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street
shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times
and after threescore and two weeks shall messiah be cut off but
not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall
destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with
a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined
and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in
the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to
cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it
desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be
poured upon the desolate
in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealed
unto daniel whose name was called belteshazzar and the thing was
true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing
and had understanding of the vision
in those days i daniel was mourning three full weeks
i ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth
neither did i anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were
fulfilled
and in the four and twentieth day of the first month as i was by
the side of the great river which is hiddekel  then i lifted up
mine eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen
whose loins were girded with fine gold of uphaz  his body also
was like the beryl and his face as the appearance of lightning and
his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in colour to
polished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a
multitude
and i daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me
saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that they
fled to hide themselves
therefore i was left alone and saw this great vision and there
remained no strength in me for my comeliness was turned in me into
corruption and i retained no strength
yet heard i the voice of his words and when i heard the voice of
his words then was i in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward
the ground
and behold an hand touched me which set me upon my knees and
upon the palms of my hands
and he said unto me o daniel a man greatly beloved understand
the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee am
i now sent
and when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling
then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day
that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself
before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words
but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one and
twenty days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help
me and i remained there with the kings of persia
now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days
and when he had spoken such words unto me i set my face toward
the ground and i became dumb
and behold one like the similitude of the sons of men touched
my lips then i opened my mouth and spake and said unto him that
stood before me o my lord by the vision my sorrows are turned upon
me and i have retained no strength
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord
for as for me straightway there remained no strength in me neither
is there breath left in me
then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of
a man and he strengthened me  and said o man greatly beloved
fear not peace be unto thee be strong yea be strong and when he
had spoken unto me i was strengthened and said let my lord speak
for thou hast strengthened me
then said he knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee and now
will i return to fight with the prince of persia and when i am gone
forth lo the prince of grecia shall come
but i will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of
truth and there is none that holdeth with me in these things but
michael your prince
also i in the first year of darius the mede even i stood to
confirm and to strengthen him
and now will i shew thee the truth behold there shall stand up
yet three kings in persia and the fourth shall be far richer than
they all and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all
against the realm of grecia
and a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great
dominion and do according to his will
and when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken and
shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven and not to his
posterity nor according to his dominion which he ruled for his
kingdom shall be plucked up even for others beside those
and the king of the south shall be strong and one of his
princes and he shall be strong above him and have dominion his
dominion shall be a great dominion
and in the end of years they shall join themselves together for
the kings daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north
to make an agreement but she shall not retain the power of the arm
neither shall he stand nor his arm but she shall be given up and
they that brought her and he that begat her and he that strengthened
her in these times
but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his
estate which shall come with an army and shall enter into the
fortress of the king of the north and shall deal against them and
shall prevail  and shall also carry captives into egypt their
gods with their princes and with their precious vessels of silver
and of gold and he shall continue more years than the king of the
north
so the king of the south shall come into his kingdom and shall
return into his own land
but his sons shall be stirred up and shall assemble a multitude
of great forces and one shall certainly come and overflow and pass
through then shall he return and be stirred up even to his
fortress
and the king of the south shall be moved with choler and shall
come forth and fight with him even with the king of the north and he
shall set forth a great multitude but the multitude shall be given
into his hand
and when he hath taken away the multitude his heart shall be
lifted up and he shall cast down many ten thousands but he shall not
be strengthened by it
for the king of the north shall return and shall set forth a
multitude greater than the former and shall certainly come after
certain years with a great army and with much riches
and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of
the south also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to
establish the vision but they shall fall
so the king of the north shall come and cast up a mount and
take the most fenced cities and the arms of the south shall not
withstand neither his chosen people neither shall there be any
strength to withstand
but he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
will and none shall stand before him and he shall stand in the
glorious land which by his hand shall be consumed
he shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
whole kingdom and upright ones with him thus shall he do and he
shall give him the daughter of women corrupting her but she shall
not stand on his side neither be for him
after this shall he turn his face unto the isles and shall take
many but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered
by him to cease without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn
upon him
then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land but
he shall stumble and fall and not be found
then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory
of the kingdom but within few days he shall be destroyed neither in
anger nor in battle
and in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they
shall not give the honour of the kingdom but he shall come in
peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries
and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before
him and shall be broken yea also the prince of the covenant
and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully
for he shall come up and shall become strong with a small people
he shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
province and he shall do that which his fathers have not done nor
his fathers fathers he shall scatter among them the prey and spoil
and riches yea and he shall forecast his devices against the strong
holds even for a time
and he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king
of the south with a great army and the king of the south shall be
stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army but he shall
not stand for they shall forecast devices against him
yea they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
him and his army shall overflow and many shall fall down slain
and both of these kings hearts shall be to do mischief and
they shall speak lies at one table but it shall not prosper for yet
the end shall be at the time appointed
then shall he return into his land with great riches and his
heart shall be against the holy covenant and he shall do exploits
and return to his own land
at the time appointed he shall return and come toward the
south but it shall not be as the former or as the latter
for the ships of chittim shall come against him therefore he
shall be grieved and return and have indignation against the holy
covenant so shall he do he shall even return and have intelligence
with them that forsake the holy covenant
and arms shall stand on his part and they shall pollute the
sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice and
they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate
and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by
flatteries but the people that do know their god shall be strong and
do exploits
and they that understand among the people shall instruct many
yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame by captivity and by
spoil many days
now when they shall fall they shall be holpen with a little
help but many shall cleave to them with flatteries
and some of them of understanding shall fall to try them and
to purge and to make them white even to the time of the end because
it is yet for a time appointed
and the king shall do according to his will and he shall exalt
himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak
marvellous things against the god of gods and shall prosper till the
indignation be accomplished for that that is determined shall be
done
neither shall he regard the god of his fathers nor the desire
of women nor regard any god for he shall magnify himself above all
but in his estate shall he honour the god of forces and a god
whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold and silver and
with precious stones and pleasant things
thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god
whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory and he shall cause
them to rule over many and shall divide the land for gain
and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
him and the king of the north shall come against him like a
whirlwind with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships and
he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over
he shall enter also into the glorious land and many countries
shall be overthrown but these shall escape out of his hand even
edom and moab and the chief of the children of ammon
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries and the
land of egypt shall not escape
but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
silver and over all the precious things of egypt and the libyans and
the ethiopians shall be at his steps
but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
him therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and
utterly to make away many
and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
seas in the glorious holy mountain yet he shall come to his end and
none shall help him
and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which
standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of
trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same
time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that
shall be found written in the book
and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake
some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt
and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for
ever and ever
but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to
the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be
increased
then i daniel looked and behold there stood other two the one
on this side of the bank of the river and the other on that side of
the bank of the river
and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the
waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders
and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters
of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto
heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a
time times and an half and when he shall have accomplished to
scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be
finished
and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what
shall be the end of these things   and he said go thy way
daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the
end
many shall be purified and made white and tried but the
wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but
the wise shall understand
and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away
and the abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be a
thousand two hundred and ninety days
blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three
hundred and five and thirty days
but go thou thy way till the end be for thou shalt rest
and stand in thy lot at the end of the days
hosea
the word of the lord that came unto hosea the son of beeri in
the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah and in
the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel
the beginning of the word of the lord by hosea and the lord said
to hosea go take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of
whoredoms for the land hath committed great whoredom departing from
the lord
so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim which
conceived and bare him a son
and the lord said unto him call his name jezreel for yet a
little while and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house of
jehu and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of israel
and it shall come to pass at that day that i will break the bow
of israel in the valley of jezreel
and she conceived again and bare a daughter and god said unto
him call her name loruhamah for i will no more have mercy upon the
house of israel but i will utterly take them away
but i will have mercy upon the house of judah and will save them
by the lord their god and will not save them by bow nor by sword
nor by battle by horses nor by horsemen
now when she had weaned loruhamah she conceived and bare a son
then said god call his name loammi for ye are not my people and
i will not be your god
yet the number of the children of israel shall be as the sand of
the sea which cannot be measured nor numbered and it shall come to
pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my
people there it shall be said unto them ye are the sons of the
living god
then shall the children of judah and the children of israel be
gathered together and appoint themselves one head and they shall
come up out of the land for great shall be the day of jezreel
say ye unto your brethren ammi and to your sisters ruhamah
plead with your mother plead for she is not my wife neither am
i her husband let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her
sight and her adulteries from between her breasts  lest i strip
her naked and set her as in the day that she was born and make her
as a wilderness and set her like a dry land and slay her with
thirst
and i will not have mercy upon her children for they be the
children of whoredoms
for their mother hath played the harlot she that conceived them
hath done shamefully for she said i will go after my lovers that
give me my bread and my water my wool and my flax mine oil and my
drink
therefore behold i will hedge up thy way with thorns and make a
wall that she shall not find her paths
and she shall follow after her lovers but she shall not overtake
them and she shall seek them but shall not find them then shall she
say i will go and return to my first husband for then was it better
with me than now
for she did not know that i gave her corn and wine and oil and
multiplied her silver and gold which they prepared for baal
therefore will i return and take away my corn in the time
thereof and my wine in the season thereof and will recover my wool
and my flax given to cover her nakedness
and now will i discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers
and none shall deliver her out of mine hand
i will also cause all her mirth to cease her feast days her new
moons and her sabbaths and all her solemn feasts
and i will destroy her vines and her fig trees whereof she hath
said these are my rewards that my lovers have given me and i will
make them a forest and the beasts of the field shall eat them
and i will visit upon her the days of baalim wherein she burned
incense to them and she decked herself with her earrings and her
jewels and she went after her lovers and forgat me saith the lord
therefore behold i will allure her and bring her into the
wilderness and speak comfortably unto her
and i will give her her vineyards from thence and the valley of
achor for a door of hope and she shall sing there as in the days of
her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of
egypt
and it shall be at that day saith the lord that thou shalt call
me ishi and shalt call me no more baali
for i will take away the names of baalim out of her mouth and
they shall no more be remembered by their name
and in that day will i make a covenant for them with the beasts
of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping
things of the ground and i will break the bow and the sword and the
battle out of the earth and will make them to lie down safely
and i will betroth thee unto me for ever yea i will betroth
thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in lovingkindness
and in mercies
i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt
know the lord
and it shall come to pass in that day i will hear saith the
lord i will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth  and
the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they
shall hear jezreel
and i will sow her unto me in the earth and i will have mercy
upon her that had not obtained mercy and i will say to them which
were not my people thou art my people and they shall say thou art
my god
then said the lord unto me go yet love a woman beloved of her
friend yet an adulteress according to the love of the lord toward
the children of israel who look to other gods and love flagons of
wine
so i bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and for an
homer of barley and an half homer of barley  and i said unto her
thou shalt abide for me many days thou shalt not play the harlot and
thou shalt not be for another man so will i also be for thee
for the children of israel shall abide many days without a king
and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an image
and without an ephod and without teraphim  afterward shall the
children of israel return and seek the lord their god and david
their king and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter
days
hear the word of the lord ye children of israel for the lord
hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land because there is
no truth nor mercy nor knowledge of god in the land
by swearing and lying and killing and stealing and committing
adultery they break out and blood toucheth blood
therefore shall the land mourn and every one that dwelleth
therein shall languish with the beasts of the field and with the
fowls of heaven yea the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away
yet let no man strive nor reprove another for thy people are as
they that strive with the priest
therefore shalt thou fall in the day and the prophet also shall
fall with thee in the night and i will destroy thy mother
my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou hast
rejected knowledge i will also reject thee that thou shalt be no
priest to me seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy god i will
also forget thy children
as they were increased so they sinned against me therefore will
i change their glory into shame
they eat up the sin of my people and they set their heart on
their iniquity
and there shall be like people like priest and i will punish
them for their ways and reward them their doings
for they shall eat and not have enough they shall commit
whoredom and shall not increase because they have left off to take
heed to the lord
whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart
my people ask counsel at their stocks and their staff declareth
unto them for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err and
they have gone a whoring from under their god
they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burn incense
upon the hills under oaks and poplars and elms because the shadow
thereof is good therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom and
your spouses shall commit adultery
i will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom nor
your spouses when they commit adultery for themselves are separated
with whores and they sacrifice with harlots therefore the people
that doth not understand shall fall
though thou israel play the harlot yet let not judah offend
and come not ye unto gilgal neither go ye up to bethaven nor swear
the lord liveth
for israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer now the lord
will feed them as a lamb in a large place
ephraim is joined to idols let him alone
their drink is sour they have committed whoredom continually
her rulers with shame do love give ye
the wind hath bound her up in her wings and they shall be
ashamed because of their sacrifices
hear ye this o priests and hearken ye house of israel and give
ye ear o house of the king for judgment is toward you because ye
have been a snare on mizpah and a net spread upon tabor
and the revolters are profound to make slaughter though i have
been a rebuker of them all
i know ephraim and israel is not hid from me for now o ephraim
thou committest whoredom and israel is defiled
they will not frame their doings to turn unto their god for the
spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them and they have not known
the lord
and the pride of israel doth testify to his face therefore shall
israel and ephraim fall in their iniquity judah also shall fall with
them
they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the
lord but they shall not find him he hath withdrawn himself from
them
they have dealt treacherously against the lord for they have
begotten strange children now shall a month devour them with their
portions
blow ye the cornet in gibeah and the trumpet in ramah cry aloud
at bethaven after thee o benjamin
ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke among the tribes
of israel have i made known that which shall surely be
the princes of judah were like them that remove the bound
therefore i will pour out my wrath upon them like water
ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment because he willingly
walked after the commandment
therefore will i be unto ephraim as a moth and to the house of
judah as rottenness
when ephraim saw his sickness and judah saw his wound then went
ephraim to the assyrian and sent to king jareb yet could he not heal
you nor cure you of your wound
for i will be unto ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the
house of judah i even i will tear and go away i will take away
and none shall rescue him
i will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their
offence and seek my face in their affliction they will seek me
early
come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn and he
will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up
after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise
us up and we shall live in his sight
then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going
forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the
rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth
o ephraim what shall i do unto thee o judah what shall i do
unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early
dew it goeth away
therefore have i hewed them by the prophets i have slain them by
the words of my mouth and thy judgments are as the light that goeth
forth
for i desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of god
more than burnt offerings
but they like men have transgressed the covenant there have they
dealt treacherously against me
gilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted with
blood
and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priests
murder in the way by consent for they commit lewdness
i have seen an horrible thing in the house of israel there is
the whoredom of ephraim israel is defiled
also o judah he hath set an harvest for thee when i returned
the captivity of my people
when i would have healed israel then the iniquity of ephraim was
discovered and the wickedness of samaria for they commit falsehood
and the thief cometh in and the troop of robbers spoileth without
and they consider not in their hearts that i remember all their
wickedness now their own doings have beset them about they are
before my face
they make the king glad with their wickedness and the princes
with their lies
they are all adulterers as an oven heated by the baker who
ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough until it be
leavened
in the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles
of wine he stretched out his hand with scorners
for they have made ready their heart like an oven whiles they lie
in wait their baker sleepeth all the night in the morning it burneth
as a flaming fire
they are all hot as an oven and have devoured their judges all
their kings are fallen there is none among them that calleth unto me
ephraim he hath mixed himself among the people ephraim is a cake
not turned
strangers have devoured his strength and he knoweth it not yea
gray hairs are here and there upon him yet he knoweth not
and the pride of israel testifieth to his face and they do not
return to the lord their god nor seek him for all this
ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart they call to
egypt they go to assyria
when they shall go i will spread my net upon them i will bring
them down as the fowls of the heaven i will chastise them as their
congregation hath heard
woe unto them for they have fled from me destruction unto them
because they have transgressed against me though i have redeemed
them yet they have spoken lies against me
and they have not cried unto me with their heart when they
howled upon their beds they assemble themselves for corn and wine
and they rebel against me
though i have bound and strengthened their arms yet do they
imagine mischief against me
they return but not to the most high they are like a deceitful
bow their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their
tongue this shall be their derision in the land of egypt
set the trumpet to thy mouth he shall come as an eagle against
the house of the lord because they have transgressed my covenant and
trespassed against my law
israel shall cry unto me my god we know thee
israel hath cast off the thing that is good the enemy shall
pursue him
they have set up kings but not by me they have made princes and
i knew it not of their silver and their gold have they made them
idols that they may be cut off
thy calf o samaria hath cast thee off mine anger is kindled
against them how long will it be ere they attain to innocency
for from israel was it also the workman made it therefore it is not
god but the calf of samaria shall be broken in pieces
for they have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind it
hath no stalk the bud shall yield no meal if so be it yield the
strangers shall swallow it up
israel is swallowed up now shall they be among the gentiles as a
vessel wherein is no pleasure
for they are gone up to assyria a wild ass alone by himself
ephraim hath hired lovers
yea though they have hired among the nations now will i gather
them and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of
princes
because ephraim hath made many altars to sin altars shall be
unto him to sin
i have written to him the great things of my law but they were
counted as a strange thing
they sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings and
eat it but the lord accepteth them not now will he remember their
iniquity and visit their sins they shall return to egypt
for israel hath forgotten his maker and buildeth temples and
judah hath multiplied fenced cities but i will send a fire upon his
cities and it shall devour the palaces thereof
rejoice not o israel for joy as other people for thou hast
gone a whoring from thy god thou hast loved a reward upon every
cornfloor
the floor and the winepress shall not feed them and the new wine
shall fail in her
they shall not dwell in the lords land but ephraim shall return
to egypt and they shall eat unclean things in assyria
they shall not offer wine offerings to the lord neither shall
they be pleasing unto him their sacrifices shall be unto them as the
bread of mourners all that eat thereof shall be polluted for their
bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the lord
what will ye do in the solemn day and in the day of the feast of
the lord   for lo they are gone because of destruction egypt
shall gather them up memphis shall bury them the pleasant places for
their silver nettles shall possess them thorns shall be in their
tabernacles
the days of visitation are come the days of recompence are come
israel shall know it the prophet is a fool the spiritual man is mad
for the multitude of thine iniquity and the great hatred
the watchman of ephraim was with my god but the prophet is a
snare of a fowler in all his ways and hatred in the house of his god
they have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of gibeah
therefore he will remember their iniquity he will visit their sins
i found israel like grapes in the wilderness i saw your fathers
as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time but they went to
baalpeor and separated themselves unto that shame and their
abominations were according as they loved
as for ephraim their glory shall fly away like a bird from the
birth and from the womb and from the conception
though they bring up their children yet will i bereave them
that there shall not be a man left yea woe also to them when i
depart from them   ephraim as i saw tyrus is planted in a
pleasant place but ephraim shall bring forth his children to the
murderer
give them o lord what wilt thou give give them a miscarrying
womb and dry breasts
all their wickedness is in gilgal for there i hated them for
the wickedness of their doings i will drive them out of mine house i
will love them no more all their princes are revolters
ephraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear no
fruit yea though they bring forth yet will i slay even the beloved
fruit of their womb
my god will cast them away because they did not hearken unto
him and they shall be wanderers among the nations
israel is an empty vine he bringeth forth fruit unto himself
according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars
according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images
their heart is divided now shall they be found faulty he shall
break down their altars he shall spoil their images
for now they shall say we have no king because we feared not
the lord what then should a king do to us   they have spoken
words swearing falsely in making a covenant thus judgment springeth
up as hemlock in the furrows of the field
the inhabitants of samaria shall fear because of the calves of
bethaven for the people thereof shall mourn over it and the priests
thereof that rejoiced on it for the glory thereof because it is
departed from it
it shall be also carried unto assyria for a present to king
jareb ephraim shall receive shame and israel shall be ashamed of his
own counsel
as for samaria her king is cut off as the foam upon the water
the high places also of aven the sin of israel shall be
destroyed the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars
and they shall say to the mountains cover us and to the hills fall
on us
o israel thou hast sinned from the days of gibeah there they
stood the battle in gibeah against the children of iniquity did not
overtake them
it is in my desire that i should chastise them and the people
shall be gathered against them when they shall bind themselves in
their two furrows
and ephraim is as an heifer that is taught and loveth to tread
out the corn but i passed over upon her fair neck i will make
ephraim to ride judah shall plow and jacob shall break his clods
sow to yourselves in righteousness reap in mercy break up your
fallow ground for it is time to seek the lord till he come and rain
righteousness upon you
ye have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity ye have
eaten the fruit of lies because thou didst trust in thy way in the
multitude of thy mighty men
therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people and all thy
fortresses shall be spoiled as shalman spoiled betharbel in the day
of battle the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children
so shall bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness in
a morning shall the king of israel utterly be cut off
when israel was a child then i loved him and called my son out
of egypt
as they called them so they went from them they sacrificed unto
baalim and burned incense to graven images
i taught ephraim also to go taking them by their arms but they
knew not that i healed them
i drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and i was to
them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws and i laid meat
unto them
he shall not return into the land of egypt and the assyrian
shall be his king because they refused to return
and the sword shall abide on his cities and shall consume his
branches and devour them because of their own counsels
and my people are bent to backsliding from me though they called
them to the most high none at all would exalt him
how shall i give thee up ephraim how shall i deliver thee
israel  how shall i make thee as admah how shall i set thee as
zeboim mine heart is turned within me my repentings are kindled
together
i will not execute the fierceness of mine anger i will not
return to destroy ephraim for i am god and not man the holy one in
the midst of thee and i will not enter into the city
they shall walk after the lord he shall roar like a lion when
he shall roar then the children shall tremble from the west
they shall tremble as a bird out of egypt and as a dove out of
the land of assyria and i will place them in their houses saith the
lord
ephraim compasseth me about with lies and the house of israel
with deceit but judah yet ruleth with god and is faithful with the
saints
ephraim feedeth on wind and followeth after the east wind he
daily increaseth lies and desolation and they do make a covenant with
the assyrians and oil is carried into egypt
the lord hath also a controversy with judah and will punish
jacob according to his ways according to his doings will he
recompense him
he took his brother by the heel in the womb and by his strength
he had power with god  yea he had power over the angel and
prevailed he wept and made supplication unto him he found him in
bethel and there he spake with us  even the lord god of hosts
the lord is his memorial
therefore turn thou to thy god keep mercy and judgment and wait
on thy god continually
he is a merchant the balances of deceit are in his hand he
loveth to oppress
and ephraim said yet i am become rich i have found me out
substance in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that
were sin
and i that am the lord thy god from the land of egypt will yet
make thee to dwell in tabernacles as in the days of the solemn feast
i have also spoken by the prophets and i have multiplied
visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets
is there iniquity in gilead surely they are vanity they
sacrifice bullocks in gilgal yea their altars are as heaps in the
furrows of the fields
and jacob fled into the country of syria and israel served for
a wife and for a wife he kept sheep
and by a prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt and by a
prophet was he preserved
ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly therefore shall he
leave his blood upon him and his reproach shall his lord return unto
him
when ephraim spake trembling he exalted himself in israel but
when he offended in baal he died
and now they sin more and more and have made them molten images
of their silver and idols according to their own understanding all
of it the work of the craftsmen they say of them let the men that
sacrifice kiss the calves
therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew
that passeth away as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out
of the floor and as the smoke out of the chimney
yet i am the lord thy god from the land of egypt and thou shalt
know no god but me for there is no saviour beside me
i did know thee in the wilderness in the land of great drought
according to their pasture so were they filled they were
filled and their heart was exalted therefore have they forgotten me
therefore i will be unto them as a lion as a leopard by the way
will i observe them  i will meet them as a bear that is bereaved
of her whelps and will rend the caul of their heart and there will i
devour them like a lion the wild beast shall tear them
o israel thou hast destroyed thyself but in me is thine help
i will be thy king where is any other that may save thee in all
thy cities and thy judges of whom thou saidst give me a king and
princes   i gave thee a king in mine anger and took him away in
my wrath
the iniquity of ephraim is bound up his sin is hid
the sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him he is an
unwise son for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking
forth of children
i will ransom them from the power of the grave i will redeem
them from death o death i will be thy plagues o grave i will be
thy destruction repentance shall be hid from mine eyes
though he be fruitful among his brethren an east wind shall
come the wind of the lord shall come up from the wilderness and his
spring shall become dry and his fountain shall be dried up he shall
spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels
samaria shall become desolate for she hath rebelled against her
god they shall fall by the sword their infants shall be dashed in
pieces and their women with child shall be ripped up
o israel return unto the lord thy god for thou hast fallen by
thine iniquity
take with you words and turn to the lord say unto him take
away all iniquity and receive us graciously so will we render the
calves of our lips
asshur shall not save us we will not ride upon horses neither
will we say any more to the work of our hands ye are our gods for in
thee the fatherless findeth mercy
i will heal their backsliding i will love them freely for mine
anger is turned away from him
i will be as the dew unto israel he shall grow as the lily and
cast forth his roots as lebanon
his branches shall spread and his beauty shall be as the olive
tree and his smell as lebanon
they that dwell under his shadow shall return they shall revive
as the corn and grow as the vine the scent thereof shall be as the
wine of lebanon
ephraim shall say what have i to do any more with idols i have
heard him and observed him i am like a green fir tree from me is
thy fruit found
who is wise and he shall understand these things prudent and
he shall know them for the ways of the lord are right and the just
shall walk in them but the transgressors shall fall therein
joel
the word of the lord that came to joel the son of pethuel
hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land
hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers
tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their
children and their children another generation
that which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten and
that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that
which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten
awake ye drunkards and weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine
because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth
for a nation is come up upon my land strong and without number
whose teeth are the teeth of a lion and he hath the cheek teeth of a
great lion
he hath laid my vine waste and barked my fig tree he hath made
it clean bare and cast it away the branches thereof are made white
lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her
youth
the meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house
of the lord the priests the lords ministers mourn
the field is wasted the land mourneth for the corn is wasted
the new wine is dried up the oil languisheth
be ye ashamed o ye husbandmen howl o ye vinedressers for the
wheat and for the barley because the harvest of the field is
perished
the vine is dried up and the fig tree languisheth the
pomegranate tree the palm tree also and the apple tree even all the
trees of the field are withered because joy is withered away from
the sons of men
gird yourselves and lament ye priests howl ye ministers of
the altar come lie all night in sackcloth ye ministers of my god
for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the
house of your god
sanctify ye a fast call a solemn assembly gather the elders and
all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the lord your god
and cry unto the lord  alas for the day for the day of the lord
is at hand and as a destruction from the almighty shall it come
is not the meat cut off before our eyes yea joy and gladness
from the house of our god   the seed is rotten under their clods
the garners are laid desolate the barns are broken down for the corn
is withered
how do the beasts groan the herds of cattle are perplexed
because they have no pasture yea the flocks of sheep are made
desolate
o lord to thee will i cry for the fire hath devoured the
pastures of the wilderness and the flame hath burned all the trees of
the field
the beasts of the field cry also unto thee for the rivers of
waters are dried up and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the
wilderness
blow ye the trumpet in zion and sound an alarm in my holy
mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of
the lord cometh for it is nigh at hand  a day of darkness and of
gloominess a day of clouds and of thick darkness as the morning
spread upon the mountains a great people and a strong there hath not
been ever the like neither shall be any more after it even to the
years of many generations
a fire devoureth before them and behind them a flame burneth the
land is as the garden of eden before them and behind them a desolate
wilderness yea and nothing shall escape them
the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and as
horsemen so shall they run
like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they
leap like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble as
a strong people set in battle array
before their face the people shall be much pained all faces shall
gather blackness
they shall run like mighty men they shall climb the wall like men
of war and they shall march every one on his ways and they shall not
break their ranks  neither shall one thrust another they shall
walk every one in his path and when they fall upon the sword they
shall not be wounded
they shall run to and fro in the city they shall run upon the
wall they shall climb up upon the houses they shall enter in at the
windows like a thief
the earth shall quake before them the heavens shall tremble the
sun and the moon shall be dark and the stars shall withdraw their
shining  and the lord shall utter his voice before his army for
his camp is very great for he is strong that executeth his word for
the day of the lord is great and very terrible and who can abide it
therefore also now saith the lord turn ye even to me with all
your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning
and rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the
lord your god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of
great kindness and repenteth him of the evil
who knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a blessing
behind him even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the lord
your god   blow the trumpet in zion sanctify a fast call a
solemn assembly  gather the people sanctify the congregation
assemble the elders gather the children and those that suck the
breasts let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out
of her closet
let the priests the ministers of the lord weep between the
porch and the altar and let them say spare thy people o lord and
give not thine heritage to reproach that the heathen should rule over
them wherefore should they say among the people where is their god
then will the lord be jealous for his land and pity his people
yea the lord will answer and say unto his people behold i will
send you corn and wine and oil and ye shall be satisfied therewith
and i will no more make you a reproach among the heathen  but i
will remove far off from you the northern army and will drive him
into a land barren and desolate with his face toward the east sea
and his hinder part toward the utmost sea and his stink shall come
up and his ill savour shall come up because he hath done great
things
fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the lord will do great
things
be not afraid ye beasts of the field for the pastures of the
wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit the fig tree and
the vine do yield their strength
be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your
god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will
cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter
rain in the first month
and the floors shall be full of wheat and the vats shall
overflow with wine and oil
and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten
the cankerworm and the caterpiller and the palmerworm my great army
which i sent among you
and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name
of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my
people shall never be ashamed
and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am
the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be
ashamed
and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my
spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see
visions  and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in
those days will i pour out my spirit
and i will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood
and fire and pillars of smoke
the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood
before the great and terrible day of the lord come
and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name
of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem
shall be deliverance as the lord hath said and in the remnant whom
the lord shall call
for behold in those days and in that time when i shall bring
again the captivity of judah and jerusalem  i will also gather all
nations and will bring them down into the valley of jehoshaphat and
will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage israel
whom they have scattered among the nations and parted my land
and they have cast lots for my people and have given a boy for an
harlot and sold a girl for wine that they might drink
yea and what have ye to do with me o tyre and zidon and all
the coasts of palestine will ye render me a recompence and if ye
recompense me swiftly and speedily will i return your recompence upon
your own head  because ye have taken my silver and my gold and
have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things  the
children also of judah and the children of jerusalem have ye sold unto
the grecians that ye might remove them far from their border
behold i will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold
them and will return your recompence upon your own head  and i
will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children
of judah and they shall sell them to the sabeans to a people far
off for the lord hath spoken it
proclaim ye this among the gentiles prepare war wake up the
mighty men let all the men of war draw near let them come up
beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears
let the weak say i am strong
assemble yourselves and come all ye heathen and gather
yourselves together round about thither cause thy mighty ones to come
down o lord
let the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of
jehoshaphat for there will i sit to judge all the heathen round
about
put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe come get you
down for the press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness
is great
multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of
the lord is near in the valley of decision
the sun and the moon shall be darkened and the stars shall
withdraw their shining
the lord also shall roar out of zion and utter his voice from
jerusalem and the heavens and the earth shall shake but the lord
will be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of
israel
so shall ye know that i am the lord your god dwelling in zion my
holy mountain then shall jerusalem be holy and there shall no
strangers pass through her any more
and it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall
drop down new wine and the hills shall flow with milk and all the
rivers of judah shall flow with waters and a fountain shall come
forth out of the house of the lord and shall water the valley of
shittim
egypt shall be a desolation and edom shall be a desolate
wilderness for the violence against the children of judah because
they have shed innocent blood in their land
but judah shall dwell for ever and jerusalem from generation to
generation
for i will cleanse their blood that i have not cleansed for the
lord dwelleth in zion
amos
the words of amos who was among the herdmen of tekoa which he
saw concerning israel in the days of uzziah king of judah and in the
days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel two years before the
earthquake
and he said the lord will roar from zion and utter his voice
from jerusalem and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn and
the top of carmel shall wither
thus saith the lord for three transgressions of damascus and for
four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have
threshed gilead with threshing instruments of iron  but i will
send a fire into the house of hazael which shall devour the palaces
of benhadad
i will break also the bar of damascus and cut off the inhabitant
from the plain of aven and him that holdeth the sceptre from the
house of eden and the people of syria shall go into captivity unto
kir saith the lord
thus saith the lord for three transgressions of gaza and for
four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they
carried away captive the whole captivity to deliver them up to edom
but i will send a fire on the wall of gaza which shall devour the
palaces thereof  and i will cut off the inhabitant from ashdod
and him that holdeth the sceptre from ashkelon and i will turn mine
hand against ekron and the remnant of the philistines shall perish
saith the lord god
thus saith the lord for three transgressions of tyrus and for
four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they
delivered up the whole captivity to edom and remembered not the
brotherly covenant  but i will send a fire on the wall of tyrus
which shall devour the palaces thereof
thus saith the lord for three transgressions of edom and for
four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because he did
pursue his brother with the sword and did cast off all pity and his
anger did tear perpetually and he kept his wrath for ever  but i
will send a fire upon teman which shall devour the palaces of bozrah
thus saith the lord for three transgressions of the children of
ammon and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof
because they have ripped up the women with child of gilead that they
might enlarge their border  but i will kindle a fire in the wall
of rabbah and it shall devour the palaces thereof with shouting in
the day of battle with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind
and their king shall go into captivity he and his princes together
saith the lord
thus saith the lord for three transgressions of moab and for
four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because he burned
the bones of the king of edom into lime  but i will send a fire
upon moab and it shall devour the palaces of kirioth and moab shall
die with tumult with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet
and i will cut off the judge from the midst thereof and will slay all
the princes thereof with him saith the lord
thus saith the lord for three transgressions of judah and for
four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have
despised the law of the lord and have not kept his commandments and
their lies caused them to err after the which their fathers have
walked  but i will send a fire upon judah and it shall devour the
palaces of jerusalem
thus saith the lord for three transgressions of israel and for
four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they sold
the righteous for silver and the poor for a pair of shoes  that
pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor and turn
aside the way of the meek and a man and his father will go in unto
the same maid to profane my holy name  and they lay themselves
down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar and they drink the
wine of the condemned in the house of their god
yet destroyed i the amorite before them whose height was like the
height of the cedars and he was strong as the oaks yet i destroyed
his fruit from above and his roots from beneath
also i brought you up from the land of egypt and led you forty
years through the wilderness to possess the land of the amorite
and i raised up of your sons for prophets and of your young men
for nazarites is it not even thus o ye children of israel saith the
lord
but ye gave the nazarites wine to drink and commanded the
prophets saying prophesy not
behold i am pressed under you as a cart is pressed that is full
of sheaves
therefore the flight shall perish from the swift and the strong
shall not strengthen his force neither shall the mighty deliver
himself  neither shall he stand that handleth the bow and he
that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself neither shall he that
rideth the horse deliver himself
and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked
in that day saith the lord
hear this word that the lord hath spoken against you o children
of israel against the whole family which i brought up from the land
of egypt saying  you only have i known of all the families of the
earth therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities
can two walk together except they be agreed   will a lion
roar in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of
his den if he have taken nothing   can a bird fall in a snare
upon the earth where no gin is for him  shall one take up a snare
from the earth and have taken nothing at all   shall a trumpet be
blown in the city and the people not be afraid  shall there be evil
in a city and the lord hath not done it   surely the lord god
will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the
prophets
the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord god hath spoken
who can but prophesy   publish in the palaces at ashdod and in
the palaces in the land of egypt and say assemble yourselves upon
the mountains of samaria and behold the great tumults in the midst
thereof and the oppressed in the midst thereof
for they know not to do right saith the lord who store up
violence and robbery in their palaces
therefore thus saith the lord god an adversary there shall be
even round about the land and he shall bring down thy strength from
thee and thy palaces shall be spoiled
thus saith the lord as the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of
the lion two legs or a piece of an ear so shall the children of
israel be taken out that dwell in samaria in the corner of a bed and
in damascus in a couch
hear ye and testify in the house of jacob saith the lord god
the god of hosts  that in the day that i shall visit the
transgressions of israel upon him i will also visit the altars of
bethel and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the
ground
and i will smite the winter house with the summer house and the
houses of ivory shall perish and the great houses shall have an end
saith the lord
hear this word ye kine of bashan that are in the mountain of
samaria which oppress the poor which crush the needy which say to
their masters bring and let us drink
the lord god hath sworn by his holiness that lo the days shall
come upon you that he will take you away with hooks and your
posterity with fishhooks
and ye shall go out at the breaches every cow at that which is
before her and ye shall cast them into the palace saith the lord
come to bethel and transgress at gilgal multiply transgression
and bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes after three
years  and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven and
proclaim and publish the free offerings for this liketh you o ye
children of israel saith the lord god
and i also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities
and want of bread in all your places yet have ye not returned unto
me saith the lord
and also i have withholden the rain from you when there were yet
three months to the harvest and i caused it to rain upon one city
and caused it not to rain upon another city one piece was rained
upon and the piece whereupon it rained not withered
so two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water but
they were not satisfied yet have ye not returned unto me saith the
lord
i have smitten you with blasting and mildew when your gardens and
your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased the
palmerworm devoured them yet have ye not returned unto me saith the
lord
i have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of egypt
your young men have i slain with the sword and have taken away your
horses and i have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your
nostrils yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord
i have overthrown some of you as god overthrew sodom and
gomorrah and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning yet
have ye not returned unto me saith the lord
therefore thus will i do unto thee o israel and because i will
do this unto thee prepare to meet thy god o israel
for lo he that formeth the mountains and createth the wind
and declareth unto man what is his thought that maketh the morning
darkness and treadeth upon the high places of the earth the lord
the god of hosts is his name
hear ye this word which i take up against you even a lamentation
o house of israel
the virgin of israel is fallen she shall no more rise she is
forsaken upon her land there is none to raise her up
for thus saith the lord god the city that went out by a thousand
shall leave an hundred and that which went forth by an hundred shall
leave ten to the house of israel
for thus saith the lord unto the house of israel seek ye me and
ye shall live  but seek not bethel nor enter into gilgal and
pass not to beersheba for gilgal shall surely go into captivity and
bethel shall come to nought
seek the lord and ye shall live lest he break out like fire in
the house of joseph and devour it and there be none to quench it in
bethel
ye who turn judgment to wormwood and leave off righteousness in
the earth  seek him that maketh the seven stars and orion and
turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark
with night that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them
out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name  that
strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong so that the spoiled
shall come against the fortress
they hate him that rebuketh in the gate and they abhor him that
speaketh uprightly
forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor and ye
take from him burdens of wheat ye have built houses of hewn stone
but ye shall not dwell in them ye have planted pleasant vineyards
but ye shall not drink wine of them
for i know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins
they afflict the just they take a bribe and they turn aside the poor
in the gate from their right
therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time for it is
an evil time
seek good and not evil that ye may live and so the lord the
god of hosts shall be with you as ye have spoken
hate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in the
gate it may be that the lord god of hosts will be gracious unto the
remnant of joseph
therefore the lord the god of hosts the lord saith thus
wailing shall be in all streets and they shall say in all the
highways alas alas  and they shall call the husbandman to mourning
and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing
and in all vineyards shall be wailing for i will pass through
thee saith the lord
woe unto you that desire the day of the lord to what end is it
for you the day of the lord is darkness and not light
as if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him or went
into the house and leaned his hand on the wall and a serpent bit
him
shall not the day of the lord be darkness and not light even
very dark and no brightness in it   i hate i despise your feast
days and i will not smell in your solemn assemblies
though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings i
will not accept them neither will i regard the peace offerings of
your fat beasts
take thou away from me the noise of thy songs for i will not
hear the melody of thy viols
but let judgment run down as waters and righteousness as a
mighty stream
have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the
wilderness forty years o house of israel   but ye have borne the
tabernacle of your moloch and chiun your images the star of your god
which ye made to yourselves
therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus
saith the lord whose name is the god of hosts
woe to them that are at ease in zion and trust in the mountain of
samaria which are named chief of the nations to whom the house of
israel came   pass ye unto calneh and see and from thence go ye
to hamath the great then go down to gath of the philistines be they
better than these kingdoms or their border greater than your border
ye that put far away the evil day and cause the seat of violence
to come near  that lie upon beds of ivory and stretch themselves
upon their couches and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves
out of the midst of the stall  that chant to the sound of the
viol and invent to themselves instruments of musick like david
that drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the chief
ointments but they are not grieved for the affliction of joseph
therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go
captive and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be
removed
the lord god hath sworn by himself saith the lord the god of
hosts i abhor the excellency of jacob and hate his palaces
therefore will i deliver up the city with all that is therein
and it shall come to pass if there remain ten men in one house
that they shall die
and a mans uncle shall take him up and he that burneth him to
bring out the bones out of the house and shall say unto him that is
by the sides of the house is there yet any with thee and he shall
say no then shall he say hold thy tongue for we may not make
mention of the name of the lord
for behold the lord commandeth and he will smite the great
house with breaches and the little house with clefts
shall horses run upon the rock will one plow there with oxen
for ye have turned judgment into gall and the fruit of righteousness
into hemlock  ye which rejoice in a thing of nought which say
have we not taken to us horns by our own strength   but behold
i will raise up against you a nation o house of israel saith the
lord the god of hosts and they shall afflict you from the entering in
of hemath unto the river of the wilderness
thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold he formed
grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth
and lo it was the latter growth after the kings mowings
and it came to pass that when they had made an end of eating the
grass of the land then i said o lord god forgive i beseech thee
by whom shall jacob arise for he is small
the lord repented for this it shall not be saith the lord
thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold the lord god
called to contend by fire and it devoured the great deep and did eat
up a part
then said i o lord god cease i beseech thee by whom shall
jacob arise for he is small
the lord repented for this this also shall not be saith the lord
god
thus he shewed me and behold the lord stood upon a wall made by
a plumbline with a plumbline in his hand
and the lord said unto me amos what seest thou and i said a
plumbline then said the lord behold i will set a plumbline in the
midst of my people israel i will not again pass by them any more
and the high places of isaac shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of
israel shall be laid waste and i will rise against the house of
jeroboam with the sword
then amaziah the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king of
israel saying amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the
house of israel the land is not able to bear all his words
for thus amos saith jeroboam shall die by the sword and israel
shall surely be led away captive out of their own land
also amaziah said unto amos o thou seer go flee thee away into
the land of judah and there eat bread and prophesy there  but
prophesy not again any more at bethel for it is the kings chapel
and it is the kings court
then answered amos and said to amaziah i was no prophet
neither was i a prophets son but i was an herdman and a gatherer of
sycomore fruit  and the lord took me as i followed the flock and
the lord said unto me go prophesy unto my people israel
now therefore hear thou the word of the lord thou sayest
prophesy not against israel and drop not thy word against the house
of isaac
therefore thus saith the lord thy wife shall be an harlot in the
city and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword and thy
land shall be divided by line and thou shalt die in a polluted land
and israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land
thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold a basket of
summer fruit
and he said amos what seest thou and i said a basket of summer
fruit then said the lord unto me the end is come upon my people of
israel i will not again pass by them any more
and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day saith
the lord god there shall be many dead bodies in every place they
shall cast them forth with silence
hear this o ye that swallow up the needy even to make the poor
of the land to fail  saying when will the new moon be gone that
we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat making
the ephah small and the shekel great and falsifying the balances by
deceit   that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a
pair of shoes yea and sell the refuse of the wheat   the lord
hath sworn by the excellency of jacob surely i will never forget any
of their works
shall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn that
dwelleth therein and it shall rise up wholly as a flood and it shall
be cast out and drowned as by the flood of egypt
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord god that i
will cause the sun to go down at noon and i will darken the earth in
the clear day  and i will turn your feasts into mourning and all
your songs into lamentation and i will bring up sackcloth upon all
loins and baldness upon every head and i will make it as the
mourning of an only son and the end thereof as a bitter day
behold the days come saith the lord god that i will send a
famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but
of hearing the words of the lord  and they shall wander from sea
to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro
to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it
in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for
thirst
they that swear by the sin of samaria and say thy god o dan
liveth and the manner of beersheba liveth even they shall fall and
never rise up again
i saw the lord standing upon the altar and he said smite the
lintel of the door that the posts may shake and cut them in the
head all of them and i will slay the last of them with the sword he
that fleeth of them shall not flee away and he that escapeth of them
shall not be delivered
though they dig into hell thence shall mine hand take them
though they climb up to heaven thence will i bring them down  and
though they hide themselves in the top of carmel i will search and
take them out thence and though they be hid from my sight in the
bottom of the sea thence will i command the serpent and he shall
bite them  and though they go into captivity before their enemies
thence will i command the sword and it shall slay them and i will
set mine eyes upon them for evil and not for good
and the lord god of hosts is he that toucheth the land and it
shall melt and all that dwell therein shall mourn and it shall rise
up wholly like a flood and shall be drowned as by the flood of
egypt
it is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven and hath founded
his troop in the earth he that calleth for the waters of the sea and
poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name
are ye not as children of the ethiopians unto me o children of
israel saith the lord have not i brought up israel out of the land
of egypt and the philistines from caphtor and the syrians from kir
behold the eyes of the lord god are upon the sinful kingdom and
i will destroy it from off the face of the earth saving that i will
not utterly destroy the house of jacob saith the lord
for lo i will command and i will sift the house of israel among
all nations like as corn is sifted in a sieve yet shall not the
least grain fall upon the earth
all the sinners of my people shall die by the sword which say
the evil shall not overtake nor prevent us
in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that is
fallen and close up the breaches thereof and i will raise up his
ruins and i will build it as in the days of old  that they may
possess the remnant of edom and of all the heathen which are called
by my name saith the lord that doeth this
behold the days come saith the lord that the plowman shall
overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed
and the mountains shall drop sweet wine and all the hills shall melt
and i will bring again the captivity of my people of israel and
they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them and they shall
plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof they shall also make
gardens and eat the fruit of them
and i will plant them upon their land and they shall no more be
pulled up out of their land which i have given them saith the lord
thy god
obadiah
the vision of obadiah thus saith the lord god concerning edom
we have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sent among
the heathen arise ye and let us rise up against her in battle
behold i have made thee small among the heathen thou art greatly
despised
the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee thou that dwellest in
the clefts of the rock whose habitation is high that saith in his
heart who shall bring me down to the ground   though thou exalt
thyself as the eagle and though thou set thy nest among the stars
thence will i bring thee down saith the lord
if thieves came to thee if robbers by night how art thou cut
off  would they not have stolen till they had enough if the
grapegatherers came to thee would they not leave some grapes
how are the things of esau searched out how are his hidden things
sought up   all the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even
to the border the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
thee and prevailed against thee that they eat thy bread have laid a
wound under thee there is none understanding in him
shall i not in that day saith the lord even destroy the wise men
out of edom and understanding out of the mount of esau   and thy
mighty men o teman shall be dismayed to the end that every one of
the mount of esau may be cut off by slaughter
for thy violence against thy brother jacob shame shall cover
thee and thou shalt be cut off for ever
in the day that thou stoodest on the other side in the day that
the strangers carried away captive his forces and foreigners entered
into his gates and cast lots upon jerusalem even thou wast as one of
them
but thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in
the day that he became a stranger neither shouldest thou have
rejoiced over the children of judah in the day of their destruction
neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress
thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the
day of their calamity yea thou shouldest not have looked on their
affliction in the day of their calamity nor have laid hands on their
substance in the day of their calamity  neither shouldest thou
have stood in the crossway to cut off those of his that did escape
neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain
in the day of distress
for the day of the lord is near upon all the heathen as thou
hast done it shall be done unto thee thy reward shall return upon
thine own head
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain so shall all the
heathen drink continually yea they shall drink and they shall
swallow down and they shall be as though they had not been
but upon mount zion shall be deliverance and there shall be
holiness and the house of jacob shall possess their possessions
and the house of jacob shall be a fire and the house of joseph a
flame and the house of esau for stubble and they shall kindle in
them and devour them and there shall not be any remaining of the
house of esau for the lord hath spoken it
and they of the south shall possess the mount of esau and they
of the plain the philistines and they shall possess the fields of
ephraim and the fields of samaria and benjamin shall possess gilead
and the captivity of this host of the children of israel shall
possess that of the canaanites even unto zarephath and the captivity
of jerusalem which is in sepharad shall possess the cities of the
south
and saviours shall come up on mount zion to judge the mount of
esau and the kingdom shall be the lords
jonah
now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amittai
saying  arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it
for their wickedness is come up before me
but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the
lord and went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish
so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them
unto tarshish from the presence of the lord
but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a
mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken
then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god
and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to
lighten it of them but jonah was gone down into the sides of the
ship and he lay and was fast asleep
so the shipmaster came to him and said unto him what meanest
thou o sleeper arise call upon thy god if so be that god will
think upon us that we perish not
and they said every one to his fellow come and let us cast lots
that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us so they cast
lots and the lot fell upon jonah
then said they unto him tell us we pray thee for whose cause
this evil is upon us what is thine occupation and whence comest
thou what is thy country and of what people art thou   and he
said unto them i am an hebrew and i fear the lord the god of
heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land
then were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him why hast
thou done this for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the
lord because he had told them
then said they unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea
may be calm unto us for the sea wrought and was tempestuous
and he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into the
sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for i know that for my sake
this great tempest is upon you
nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land but they
could not for the sea wrought and was tempestuous against them
wherefore they cried unto the lord and said we beseech thee o
lord we beseech thee let us not perish for this mans life and lay
not upon us innocent blood for thou o lord hast done as it pleased
thee
so they look up jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the
sea ceased from her raging
then the men feared the lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice
unto the lord and made vows
now the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah and
jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights
then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fishs belly
and said i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and
he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heardest my
voice
for thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas
and the floods compassed me about all thy billows and thy waves
passed over me
then i said i am cast out of thy sight yet i will look again
toward thy holy temple
the waters compassed me about even to the soul the depth closed
me round about the weeds were wrapped about my head
i went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with her
bars was about me for ever yet hast thou brought up my life from
corruption o lord my god
when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord and my
prayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple
they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy
but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving i
will pay that that i have vowed salvation is of the lord
and the lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out jonah upon
the dry land
and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time saying
arise go unto nineveh that great city and preach unto it the
preaching that i bid thee
so jonah arose and went unto nineveh according to the word of
the lord now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days
journey
and jonah began to enter into the city a days journey and he
cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown
so the people of nineveh believed god and proclaimed a fast and
put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them
for word came unto the king of nineveh and he arose from his
throne and he laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth
and sat in ashes
and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through nineveh by
the decree of the king and his nobles saying let neither man nor
beast herd nor flock taste any thing let them not feed nor drink
water  but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry
mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and
from the violence that is in their hands
who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his
fierce anger that we perish not   and god saw their works that
they turned from their evil way and god repented of the evil that he
had said that he would do unto them and he did it not
but it displeased jonah exceedingly and he was very angry
and he prayed unto the lord and said i pray thee o lord was
not this my saying when i was yet in my country therefore i fled
before unto tarshish for i knew that thou art a gracious god and
merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentest thee of
the evil
therefore now o lord take i beseech thee my life from me for
it is better for me to die than to live
then said the lord doest thou well to be angry   so jonah
went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there
made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might see
what would become of the city
and the lord god prepared a gourd and made it to come up over
jonah that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from
his grief so jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd
but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day and it
smote the gourd that it withered
and it came to pass when the sun did arise that god prepared a
vehement east wind and the sun beat upon the head of jonah that he
fainted and wished in himself to die and said it is better for me
to die than to live
and god said to jonah doest thou well to be angry for the gourd
and he said i do well to be angry even unto death
then said the lord thou hast had pity on the gourd for the
which thou hast not laboured neither madest it grow which came up in
a night and perished in a night  and should not i spare nineveh
that great city wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that
cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also
much cattle
micah
the word of the lord that came to micah the morasthite in the
days of jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah which he saw
concerning samaria and jerusalem
hear all ye people hearken o earth and all that therein is
and let the lord god be witness against you the lord from his holy
temple
for behold the lord cometh forth out of his place and will come
down and tread upon the high places of the earth
and the mountains shall be molten under him and the valleys shall
be cleft as wax before the fire and as the waters that are poured
down a steep place
for the transgression of jacob is all this and for the sins of
the house of israel what is the transgression of jacob is it not
samaria and what are the high places of judah are they not
jerusalem   therefore i will make samaria as an heap of the field
and as plantings of a vineyard and i will pour down the stones
thereof into the valley and i will discover the foundations thereof
and all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces and
all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire and all the idols
thereof will i lay desolate for she gathered it of the hire of an
harlot and they shall return to the hire of an harlot
therefore i will wail and howl i will go stripped and naked i
will make a wailing like the dragons and mourning as the owls
for her wound is incurable for it is come unto judah he is come
unto the gate of my people even to jerusalem
declare ye it not at gath weep ye not at all in the house of
aphrah roll thyself in the dust
pass ye away thou inhabitant of saphir having thy shame naked
the inhabitant of zaanan came not forth in the mourning of bethezel
he shall receive of you his standing
for the inhabitant of maroth waited carefully for good but evil
came down from the lord unto the gate of jerusalem
o thou inhabitant of lachish bind the chariot to the swift
beast she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of zion for
the transgressions of israel were found in thee
therefore shalt thou give presents to moreshethgath the houses
of achzib shall be a lie to the kings of israel
yet will i bring an heir unto thee o inhabitant of mareshah he
shall come unto adullam the glory of israel
make thee bald and poll thee for thy delicate children enlarge
thy baldness as the eagle for they are gone into captivity from thee
woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds
when the morning is light they practise it because it is in the
power of their hand
and they covet fields and take them by violence and houses and
take them away so they oppress a man and his house even a man and
his heritage
therefore thus saith the lord behold against this family do i
devise an evil from which ye shall not remove your necks neither
shall ye go haughtily for this time is evil
in that day shall one take up a parable against you and lament
with a doleful lamentation and say we be utterly spoiled he hath
changed the portion of my people how hath he removed it from me
turning away he hath divided our fields
therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in
the congregation of the lord
prophesy ye not say they to them that prophesy they shall not
prophesy to them that they shall not take shame
o thou that art named the house of jacob is the spirit of the
lord straitened are these his doings do not my words do good to him
that walketh uprightly   even of late my people is risen up as an
enemy ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by
securely as men averse from war
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant
houses from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever
arise ye and depart for this is not your rest because it is
polluted it shall destroy you even with a sore destruction
if a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie saying i
will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink he shall even be
the prophet of this people
i will surely assemble o jacob all of thee i will surely
gather the remnant of israel i will put them together as the sheep of
bozrah as the flock in the midst of their fold they shall make great
noise by reason of the multitude of men
the breaker is come up before them they have broken up and have
passed through the gate and are gone out by it and their king shall
pass before them and the lord on the head of them
and i said hear i pray you o heads of jacob and ye princes of
the house of israel is it not for you to know judgment   who hate
the good and love the evil who pluck off their skin from off them
and their flesh from off their bones  who also eat the flesh of my
people and flay their skin from off them and they break their bones
and chop them in pieces as for the pot and as flesh within the
caldron
then shall they cry unto the lord but he will not hear them he
will even hide his face from them at that time as they have behaved
themselves ill in their doings
thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that make my people
err that bite with their teeth and cry peace and he that putteth
not into their mouths they even prepare war against him
therefore night shall be unto you that ye shall not have a
vision and it shall be dark unto you that ye shall not divine and
the sun shall go down over the prophets and the day shall be dark
over them
then shall the seers be ashamed and the diviners confounded yea
they shall all cover their lips for there is no answer of god
but truly i am full of power by the spirit of the lord and of
judgment and of might to declare unto jacob his transgression and
to israel his sin
hear this i pray you ye heads of the house of jacob and princes
of the house of israel that abhor judgment and pervert all equity
they build up zion with blood and jerusalem with iniquity
the heads thereof judge for reward and the priests thereof teach
for hire and the prophets thereof divine for money yet will they
lean upon the lord and say is not the lord among us none evil can
come upon us
therefore shall zion for your sake be plowed as a field and
jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the
high places of the forest
but in the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of
the house of the lord shall be established in the top of the
mountains and it shall be exalted above the hills and people shall
flow unto it
and many nations shall come and say come and let us go up to
the mountain of the lord and to the house of the god of jacob and he
will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for the law
shall go forth of zion and the word of the lord from jerusalem
and he shall judge among many people and rebuke strong nations
afar off and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their
spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up a sword against
nation neither shall they learn war any more
but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig
tree and none shall make them afraid for the mouth of the lord of
hosts hath spoken it
for all people will walk every one in the name of his god and we
will walk in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever
in that day saith the lord will i assemble her that halteth and
i will gather her that is driven out and her that i have afflicted
and i will make her that halted a remnant and her that was cast
far off a strong nation and the lord shall reign over them in mount
zion from henceforth even for ever
and thou o tower of the flock the strong hold of the daughter of
zion unto thee shall it come even the first dominion the kingdom
shall come to the daughter of jerusalem
now why dost thou cry out aloud is there no king in thee is thy
counsellor perished for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail
be in pain and labour to bring forth o daughter of zion like a
woman in travail for now shalt thou go forth out of the city and
thou shalt dwell in the field and thou shalt go even to babylon
there shalt thou be delivered there the lord shall redeem thee from
the hand of thine enemies
now also many nations are gathered against thee that say let
her be defiled and let our eye look upon zion
but they know not the thoughts of the lord neither understand
they his counsel for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the
floor
arise and thresh o daughter of zion for i will make thine horn
iron and i will make thy hoofs brass and thou shalt beat in pieces
many people and i will consecrate their gain unto the lord and their
substance unto the lord of the whole earth
now gather thyself in troops o daughter of troops he hath laid
siege against us they shall smite the judge of israel with a rod upon
the cheek
but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be little among the
thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that
is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old
from everlasting
therefore will he give them up until the time that she which
travaileth hath brought forth then the remnant of his brethren shall
return unto the children of israel
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord in the
majesty of the name of the lord his god and they shall abide for now
shall he be great unto the ends of the earth
and this man shall be the peace when the assyrian shall come into
our land and when he shall tread in our palaces then shall we raise
against him seven shepherds and eight principal men
and they shall waste the land of assyria with the sword and the
land of nimrod in the entrances thereof thus shall he deliver us from
the assyrian when he cometh into our land and when he treadeth
within our borders
and the remnant of jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a
dew from the lord as the showers upon the grass that tarrieth not
for man nor waiteth for the sons of men
and the remnant of jacob shall be among the gentiles in the midst
of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest as a young
lion among the flocks of sheep who if he go through both treadeth
down and teareth in pieces and none can deliver
thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries and all
thine enemies shall be cut off
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that i
will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee and i will destroy
thy chariots  and i will cut off the cities of thy land and
throw down all thy strong holds  and i will cut off witchcrafts
out of thine hand and thou shalt have no more soothsayers  thy
graven images also will i cut off and thy standing images out of the
midst of thee and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands
and i will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee so will
i destroy thy cities
and i will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen
such as they have not heard
hear ye now what the lord saith arise contend thou before the
mountains and let the hills hear thy voice
hear ye o mountains the lords controversy and ye strong
foundations of the earth for the lord hath a controversy with his
people and he will plead with israel
o my people what have i done unto thee and wherein have i
wearied thee testify against me
for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt and redeemed thee
out of the house of servants and i sent before thee moses aaron and
miriam
o my people remember now what balak king of moab consulted and
what balaam the son of beor answered him from shittim unto gilgal
that ye may know the righteousness of the lord
wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the
high god shall i come before him with burnt offerings with calves of
a year old   will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams or
with ten thousands of rivers of oil shall i give my firstborn for my
transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul   he
hath shewed thee o man what is good and what doth the lord require
of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with
thy god   the lords voice crieth unto the city and the man of
wisdom shall see thy name hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it
are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the
wicked and the scant measure that is abominable   shall i count
them pure with the wicked balances and with the bag of deceitful
weights   for the rich men thereof are full of violence and the
inhabitants thereof have spoken lies and their tongue is deceitful in
their mouth
therefore also will i make thee sick in smiting thee in making
thee desolate because of thy sins
thou shalt eat but not be satisfied and thy casting down shall
be in the midst of thee and thou shalt take hold but shalt not
deliver and that which thou deliverest will i give up to the sword
thou shalt sow but thou shalt not reap thou shalt tread the
olives but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil and sweet wine but
shalt not drink wine
for the statutes of omri are kept and all the works of the house
of ahab and ye walk in their counsels that i should make thee a
desolation and the inhabitants thereof an hissing therefore ye shall
bear the reproach of my people
woe is me for i am as when they have gathered the summer fruits
as the grapegleanings of the vintage there is no cluster to eat my
soul desired the firstripe fruit
the good man is perished out of the earth and there is none
upright among men they all lie in wait for blood they hunt every man
his brother with a net
that they may do evil with both hands earnestly the prince
asketh and the judge asketh for a reward and the great man he
uttereth his mischievous desire so they wrap it up
the best of them is as a brier the most upright is sharper than a
thorn hedge the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh now
shall be their perplexity
trust ye not in a friend put ye not confidence in a guide keep
the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom
for the son dishonoureth the father the daughter riseth up
against her mother the daughter in law against her mother in law a
mans enemies are the men of his own house
therefore i will look unto the lord i will wait for the god of my
salvation my god will hear me
rejoice not against me o mine enemy when i fall i shall arise
when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me
i will bear the indignation of the lord because i have sinned
against him until he plead my cause and execute judgment for me he
will bring me forth to the light and i shall behold his
righteousness
then she that is mine enemy shall see it and shame shall cover
her which said unto me where is the lord thy god mine eyes shall
behold her now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets
in the day that thy walls are to be built in that day shall the
decree be far removed
in that day also he shall come even to thee from assyria and
from the fortified cities and from the fortress even to the river
and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain
notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that
dwell therein for the fruit of their doings
feed thy people with thy rod the flock of thine heritage which
dwell solitarily in the wood in the midst of carmel let them feed in
bashan and gilead as in the days of old
according to the days of thy coming out of the land of egypt will
i shew unto him marvellous things
the nations shall see and be confounded at all their might they
shall lay their hand upon their mouth their ears shall be deaf
they shall lick the dust like a serpent they shall move out of
their holes like worms of the earth they shall be afraid of the lord
our god and shall fear because of thee
who is a god like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity and passeth
by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retaineth not
his anger for ever because he delighteth in mercy
he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will
subdue our iniquities and thou wilt cast all their sins into the
depths of the sea
thou wilt perform the truth to jacob and the mercy to abraham
which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old
nahum
the burden of nineveh the book of the vision of nahum the elkoshite
god is jealous and the lord revengeth the lord revengeth and is
furious the lord will take vengeance on his adversaries and he
reserveth wrath for his enemies
the lord is slow to anger and great in power and will not at all
acquit the wicked the lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the
storm and the clouds are the dust of his feet
he rebuketh the sea and maketh it dry and drieth up all the
rivers bashan languisheth and carmel and the flower of lebanon
languisheth
the mountains quake at him and the hills melt and the earth is
burned at his presence yea the world and all that dwell therein
who can stand before his indignation and who can abide in the
fierceness of his anger his fury is poured out like fire and the
rocks are thrown down by him
the lord is good a strong hold in the day of trouble and he
knoweth them that trust in him
but with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the
place thereof and darkness shall pursue his enemies
what do ye imagine against the lord he will make an utter end
affliction shall not rise up the second time
for while they be folden together as thorns and while they are
drunken as drunkards they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry
there is one come out of thee that imagineth evil against the
lord a wicked counsellor
thus saith the lord though they be quiet and likewise many yet
thus shall they be cut down when he shall pass through though i have
afflicted thee i will afflict thee no more
for now will i break his yoke from off thee and will burst thy
bonds in sunder
and the lord hath given a commandment concerning thee that no
more of thy name be sown out of the house of thy gods will i cut off
the graven image and the molten image i will make thy grave for thou
art vile
behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
tidings that publisheth peace o judah keep thy solemn feasts
perform thy vows for the wicked shall no more pass through thee he
is utterly cut off
he that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face keep the
munition watch the way make thy loins strong fortify thy power
mightily
for the lord hath turned away the excellency of jacob as the
excellency of israel for the emptiers have emptied them out and
marred their vine branches
the shield of his mighty men is made red the valiant men are in
scarlet the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his
preparation and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken
the chariots shall rage in the streets they shall justle one
against another in the broad ways they shall seem like torches they
shall run like the lightnings
he shall recount his worthies they shall stumble in their walk
they shall make haste to the wall thereof and the defence shall be
prepared
the gates of the rivers shall be opened and the palace shall be
dissolved
and huzzab shall be led away captive she shall be brought up and
her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves tabering upon
their breasts
but nineveh is of old like a pool of water yet they shall flee
away
stand stand shall they cry but none shall look back
take ye the spoil of silver take the spoil of gold for there is
none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture
she is empty and void and waste and the heart melteth and the
knees smite together and much pain is in all loins and the faces of
them all gather blackness
where is the dwelling of the lions and the feedingplace of the
young lions where the lion even the old lion walked and the lions
whelp and none made them afraid   the lion did tear in pieces
enough for his whelps and strangled for his lionesses and filled his
holes with prey and his dens with ravin
behold i am against thee saith the lord of hosts and i will
burn her chariots in the smoke and the sword shall devour thy young
lions and i will cut off thy prey from the earth and the voice of
thy messengers shall no more be heard
woe to the bloody city it is all full of lies and robbery the
prey departeth not  the noise of a whip and the noise of the
rattling of the wheels and of the pransing horses and of the jumping
chariots
the horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering
spear and there is a multitude of slain and a great number of
carcases and there is none end of their corpses they stumble upon
their corpses  because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the
wellfavoured harlot the mistress of witchcrafts that selleth nations
through her whoredoms and families through her witchcrafts
behold i am against thee saith the lord of hosts and i will
discover thy skirts upon thy face and i will shew the nations thy
nakedness and the kingdoms thy shame
and i will cast abominable filth upon thee and make thee vile
and will set thee as a gazingstock
and it shall come to pass that all they that look upon thee shall
flee from thee and say nineveh is laid waste who will bemoan her
whence shall i seek comforters for thee   art thou better than
populous no that was situate among the rivers that had the waters
round about it whose rampart was the sea and her wall was from the
sea   ethiopia and egypt were her strength and it was infinite
put and lubim were thy helpers
yet was she carried away she went into captivity her young
children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets and
they cast lots for her honourable men and all her great men were
bound in chains
thou also shalt be drunken thou shalt be hid thou also shalt
seek strength because of the enemy
all thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe
figs if they be shaken they shall even fall into the mouth of the
eater
behold thy people in the midst of thee are women the gates of
thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies the fire shall
devour thy bars
draw thee waters for the siege fortify thy strong holds go into
clay and tread the morter make strong the brickkiln
there shall the fire devour thee the sword shall cut thee off
it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm make thyself many as the
cankerworm make thyself many as the locusts
thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven the
cankerworm spoileth and fleeth away
thy crowned are as the locusts and thy captains as the great
grasshoppers which camp in the hedges in the cold day but when the
sun ariseth they flee away and their place is not known where they
are
thy shepherds slumber o king of assyria thy nobles shall dwell
in the dust thy people is scattered upon the mountains and no man
gathereth them
there is no healing of thy bruise thy wound is grievous all
that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee for upon
whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually
habakkuk
the burden which habakkuk the prophet did see
o lord how long shall i cry and thou wilt not hear even cry out
unto thee of violence and thou wilt not save   why dost thou shew
me iniquity and cause me to behold grievance for spoiling and
violence are before me and there are that raise up strife and
contention
therefore the law is slacked and judgment doth never go forth
for the wicked doth compass about the righteous therefore wrong
judgment proceedeth
behold ye among the heathen and regard and wonder marvelously
for i will work a work in your days which ye will not believe though
it be told you
for lo i raise up the chaldeans that bitter and hasty nation
which shall march through the breadth of the land to possess the
dwellingplaces that are not theirs
they are terrible and dreadful their judgment and their dignity
shall proceed of themselves
their horses also are swifter than the leopards and are more
fierce than the evening wolves and their horsemen shall spread
themselves and their horsemen shall come from far they shall fly as
the eagle that hasteth to eat
they shall come all for violence their faces shall sup up as the
east wind and they shall gather the captivity as the sand
and they shall scoff at the kings and the princes shall be a
scorn unto them they shall deride every strong hold for they shall
heap dust and take it
then shall his mind change and he shall pass over and offend
imputing this his power unto his god
art thou not from everlasting o lord my god mine holy one we
shall not die o lord thou hast ordained them for judgment and o
mighty god thou hast established them for correction
thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil and canst not look on
iniquity wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously
and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more
righteous than he   and makest men as the fishes of the sea as
the creeping things that have no ruler over them   they take up
all of them with the angle they catch them in their net and gather
them in their drag therefore they rejoice and are glad
therefore they sacrifice unto their net and burn incense unto
their drag because by them their portion is fat and their meat
plenteous
shall they therefore empty their net and not spare continually
to slay the nations   i will stand upon my watch and set me upon
the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what i
shall answer when i am reproved
and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it
plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it
for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it
shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it
will surely come it will not tarry
behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the
just shall live by his faith
yea also because he transgresseth by wine he is a proud man
neither keepeth at home who enlargeth his desire as hell and is as
death and cannot be satisfied but gathereth unto him all nations
and heapeth unto him all people  shall not all these take up a
parable against him and a taunting proverb against him and say woe
to him that increaseth that which is not his how long and to him
that ladeth himself with thick clay   shall they not rise up
suddenly that shall bite thee and awake that shall vex thee and thou
shalt be for booties unto them   because thou hast spoiled many
nations all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee because of
mens blood and for the violence of the land of the city and of all
that dwell therein
woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house that
he may set his nest on high that he may be delivered from the power
of evil   thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off
many people and hast sinned against thy soul
for the stone shall cry out of the wall and the beam out of the
timber shall answer it
woe to him that buildeth a town with blood and stablisheth a
city by iniquity   behold is it not of the lord of hosts that
the people shall labour in the very fire and the people shall weary
themselves for very vanity   for the earth shall be filled with
the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters cover the sea
woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink that puttest thy
bottle to him and makest him drunken also that thou mayest look on
their nakedness   thou art filled with shame for glory drink
thou also and let thy foreskin be uncovered the cup of the lords
right hand shall be turned unto thee and shameful spewing shall be on
thy glory
for the violence of lebanon shall cover thee and the spoil of
beasts which made them afraid because of mens blood and for the
violence of the land of the city and of all that dwell therein
what profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath
graven it the molten image and a teacher of lies that the maker of
his work trusteth therein to make dumb idols   woe unto him that
saith to the wood awake to the dumb stone arise it shall teach
behold it is laid over with gold and silver and there is no breath
at all in the midst of it
but the lord is in his holy temple let all the earth keep
silence before him
a prayer of habakkuk the prophet upon shigionoth
o lord i have heard thy speech and was afraid o lord revive
thy work in the midst of the years in the midst of the years make
known in wrath remember mercy
god came from teman and the holy one from mount paran selah his
glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise
and his brightness was as the light he had horns coming out of
his hand and there was the hiding of his power
before him went the pestilence and burning coals went forth at
his feet
he stood and measured the earth he beheld and drove asunder the
nations and the everlasting mountains were scattered the perpetual
hills did bow his ways are everlasting
i saw the tents of cushan in affliction and the curtains of the
land of midian did tremble
was the lord displeased against the rivers was thine anger
against the rivers was thy wrath against the sea that thou didst
ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation   thy bow was
made quite naked according to the oaths of the tribes even thy word
selah thou didst cleave the earth with rivers
the mountains saw thee and they trembled the overflowing of the
water passed by the deep uttered his voice and lifted up his hands
on high
the sun and moon stood still in their habitation at the light of
thine arrows they went and at the shining of thy glittering spear
thou didst march through the land in indignation thou didst
thresh the heathen in anger
thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people even for
salvation with thine anointed thou woundedst the head out of the
house of the wicked by discovering the foundation unto the neck
selah
thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his
villages they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me their rejoicing
was as to devour the poor secretly
thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses through the
heap of great waters
when i heard my belly trembled my lips quivered at the voice
rottenness entered into my bones and i trembled in myself that i
might rest in the day of trouble when he cometh up unto the people
he will invade them with his troops
although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be
in the vines the labour of the olive shall fail and the fields shall
yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there
shall be no herd in the stalls  yet i will rejoice in the lord i
will joy in the god of my salvation
the lord god is my strength and he will make my feet like hinds
feet and he will make me to walk upon mine high places to the chief
singer on my stringed instruments
zephaniah
the word of the lord which came unto zephaniah the son of cushi
the son of gedaliah the son of amariah the son of hizkiah in the
days of josiah the son of amon king of judah
i will utterly consume all things from off the land saith the
lord
i will consume man and beast i will consume the fowls of the
heaven and the fishes of the sea and the stumbling blocks with the
wicked and i will cut off man from off the land saith the lord
i will also stretch out mine hand upon judah and upon all the
inhabitants of jerusalem and i will cut off the remnant of baal from
this place and the name of the chemarims with the priests  and
them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops and them that
worship and that swear by the lord and that swear by malcham  and
them that are turned back from the lord and those that have not
sought the lord nor enquired for him
hold thy peace at the presence of the lord god for the day of the
lord is at hand for the lord hath prepared a sacrifice he hath bid
his guests
and it shall come to pass in the day of the lords sacrifice that
i will punish the princes and the kings children and all such as
are clothed with strange apparel
in the same day also will i punish all those that leap on the
threshold which fill their masters houses with violence and deceit
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that there
shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate and an howling from
the second and a great crashing from the hills
howl ye inhabitants of maktesh for all the merchant people are
cut down all they that bear silver are cut off
and it shall come to pass at that time that i will search
jerusalem with candles and punish the men that are settled on their
lees that say in their heart the lord will not do good neither will
he do evil
therefore their goods shall become a booty and their houses a
desolation they shall also build houses but not inhabit them and
they shall plant vineyards but not drink the wine thereof
the great day of the lord is near it is near and hasteth
greatly even the voice of the day of the lord the mighty man shall
cry there bitterly
that day is a day of wrath a day of trouble and distress a day
of wasteness and desolation a day of darkness and gloominess a day
of clouds and thick darkness  a day of the trumpet and alarm
against the fenced cities and against the high towers
and i will bring distress upon men that they shall walk like
blind men because they have sinned against the lord and their blood
shall be poured out as dust and their flesh as the dung
neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them
in the day of the lords wrath but the whole land shall be devoured
by the fire of his jealousy for he shall make even a speedy riddance
of all them that dwell in the land
gather yourselves together yea gather together o nation not
desired  before the decree bring forth before the day pass as the
chaff before the fierce anger of the lord come upon you before the
day of the lords anger come upon you
seek ye the lord all ye meek of the earth which have wrought his
judgment seek righteousness seek meekness it may be ye shall be hid
in the day of the lords anger
for gaza shall be forsaken and ashkelon a desolation they shall
drive out ashdod at the noon day and ekron shall be rooted up
woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast the nation of the
cherethites the word of the lord is against you o canaan the land
of the philistines i will even destroy thee that there shall be no
inhabitant
and the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds
and folds for flocks
and the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of judah they
shall feed thereupon in the houses of ashkelon shall they lie down in
the evening for the lord their god shall visit them and turn away
their captivity
i have heard the reproach of moab and the revilings of the
children of ammon whereby they have reproached my people and
magnified themselves against their border
therefore as i live saith the lord of hosts the god of israel
surely moab shall be as sodom and the children of ammon as gomorrah
even the breeding of nettles and saltpits and a perpetual
desolation the residue of my people shall spoil them and the remnant
of my people shall possess them
this shall they have for their pride because they have
reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the lord of
hosts
the lord will be terrible unto them for he will famish all the
gods of the earth and men shall worship him every one from his
place even all the isles of the heathen
ye ethiopians also ye shall be slain by my sword
and he will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy
assyria and will make nineveh a desolation and dry like a
wilderness
and flocks shall lie down in the midst of her all the beasts of
the nations both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the
upper lintels of it their voice shall sing in the windows desolation
shall be in the thresholds for he shall uncover the cedar work
this is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly that said in
her heart i am and there is none beside me how is she become a
desolation a place for beasts to lie down in every one that passeth
by her shall hiss and wag his hand
woe to her that is filthy and polluted to the oppressing city
she obeyed not the voice she received not correction she trusted
not in the lord she drew not near to her god
her princes within her are roaring lions her judges are evening
wolves they gnaw not the bones till the morrow
her prophets are light and treacherous persons her priests have
polluted the sanctuary they have done violence to the law
the just lord is in the midst thereof he will not do iniquity
every morning doth he bring his judgment to light he faileth not but
the unjust knoweth no shame
i have cut off the nations their towers are desolate i made
their streets waste that none passeth by their cities are destroyed
so that there is no man that there is none inhabitant
i said surely thou wilt fear me thou wilt receive instruction
so their dwelling should not be cut off howsoever i punished them
but they rose early and corrupted all their doings
therefore wait ye upon me saith the lord until the day that i
rise up to the prey for my determination is to gather the nations
that i may assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them mine indignation
even all my fierce anger for all the earth shall be devoured with the
fire of my jealousy
for then will i turn to the people a pure language that they may
all call upon the name of the lord to serve him with one consent
from beyond the rivers of ethiopia my suppliants even the
daughter of my dispersed shall bring mine offering
in that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein
thou hast transgressed against me for then i will take away out of
the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride and thou shalt no
more be haughty because of my holy mountain
i will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor
people and they shall trust in the name of the lord
the remnant of israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies
neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they
shall feed and lie down and none shall make them afraid
sing o daughter of zion shout o israel be glad and rejoice
with all the heart o daughter of jerusalem
the lord hath taken away thy judgments he hath cast out thine
enemy the king of israel even the lord is in the midst of thee
thou shalt not see evil any more
in that day it shall be said to jerusalem fear thou not and to
zion let not thine hands be slack
the lord thy god in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he
will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy
over thee with singing
i will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly
who are of thee to whom the reproach of it was a burden
behold at that time i will undo all that afflict thee and i
will save her that halteth and gather her that was driven out and i
will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put
to shame
at that time will i bring you again even in the time that i
gather you for i will make you a name and a praise among all people
of the earth when i turn back your captivity before your eyes
saith the lord
haggai
in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month in the
first day of the month came the word of the lord by haggai the
prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shealtiel governor of judah and
to joshua the son of josedech the high priest saying  thus
speaketh the lord of hosts saying this people say the time is not
come the time that the lords house should be built
then came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet saying
is it time for you o ye to dwell in your cieled houses and this
house lie waste   now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts
consider your ways
ye have sown much and bring in little ye eat but ye have not
enough ye drink but ye are not filled with drink ye clothe you but
there is none warm and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it
into a bag with holes
thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways
go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and i
will take pleasure in it and i will be glorified saith the lord
ye looked for much and lo it came to little and when ye brought
it home i did blow upon it why saith the lord of hosts because of
mine house that is waste and ye run every man unto his own house
therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew and the earth
is stayed from her fruit
and i called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains
and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon
that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle
and upon all the labour of the hands
then zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and joshua the son of
josedech the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed
the voice of the lord their god and the words of haggai the prophet
as the lord their god had sent him and the people did fear before the
lord
then spake haggai the lords messenger in the lords message unto
the people saying i am with you saith the lord
and the lord stirred up the spirit of zerubbabel the son of
shealtiel governor of judah and the spirit of joshua the son of
josedech the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the
people and they came and did work in the house of the lord of hosts
their god  in the four and twentieth day of the sixth month in
the second year of darius the king
in the seventh month in the one and twentieth day of the month
came the word of the lord by the prophet haggai saying  speak now
to zerubbabel the son of shealtiel governor of judah and to joshua
the son of josedech the high priest and to the residue of the
people saying  who is left among you that saw this house in her
first glory and how do ye see it now is it not in your eyes in
comparison of it as nothing   yet now be strong o zerubbabel
saith the lord and be strong o joshua son of josedech the high
priest and be strong all ye people of the land saith the lord and
work for i am with you saith the lord of hosts  according to the
word that i covenanted with you when ye came out of egypt so my
spirit remaineth among you fear ye not
for thus saith the lord of hosts yet once it is a little while
and i will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry
land  and i will shake all nations and the desire of all nations
shall come and i will fill this house with glory saith the lord of
hosts
the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the lord of hosts
the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the
former saith the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace
saith the lord of hosts
in the four and twentieth day of the ninth month in the second
year of darius came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet
saying  thus saith the lord of hosts ask now the priests
concerning the law saying  if one bear holy flesh in the skirt
of his garment and with his skirt do touch bread or pottage or
wine or oil or any meat shall it be holy and the priests answered
and said no
then said haggai if one that is unclean by a dead body touch any
of these shall it be unclean and the priests answered and said it
shall be unclean
then answered haggai and said so is this people and so is this
nation before me saith the lord and so is every work of their hands
and that which they offer there is unclean
and now i pray you consider from this day and upward from
before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the lord
since those days were when one came to an heap of twenty measures
there were but ten when one came to the pressfat for to draw out
fifty vessels out of the press there were but twenty
i smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all
the labours of your hands yet ye turned not to me saith the lord
consider now from this day and upward from the four and
twentieth day of the ninth month even from the day that the
foundation of the lords temple was laid consider it
is the seed yet in the barn yea as yet the vine and the fig
tree and the pomegranate and the olive tree hath not brought forth
from this day will i bless you
and again the word of the lord came unto haggai in the four and
twentieth day of the month saying  speak to zerubbabel governor
of judah saying i will shake the heavens and the earth  and i
will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and i will destroy the strength
of the kingdoms of the heathen and i will overthrow the chariots and
those that ride in them and the horses and their riders shall come
down every one by the sword of his brother
in that day saith the lord of hosts will i take thee o
zerubbabel my servant the son of shealtiel saith the lord and will
make thee as a signet for i have chosen thee saith the lord of hosts
zechariah
in the eighth month in the second year of darius came the word
of the lord unto zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the
prophet saying  the lord hath been sore displeased with your
fathers
therefore say thou unto them thus saith the lord of hosts turn
ye unto me saith the lord of hosts and i will turn unto you saith
the lord of hosts
be ye not as your fathers unto whom the former prophets have
cried saying thus saith the lord of hosts turn ye now from your
evil ways and from your evil doings but they did not hear nor
hearken unto me saith the lord
your fathers where are they and the prophets do they live for
ever   but my words and my statutes which i commanded my servants
the prophets did they not take hold of your fathers and they
returned and said like as the lord of hosts thought to do unto us
according to our ways and according to our doings so hath he dealt
with us
upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is
the month sebat in the second year of darius came the word of the
lord unto zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the
prophet saying  i saw by night and behold a man riding upon a
red horse and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the
bottom and behind him were there red horses speckled and white
then said i o my lord what are these and the angel that talked
with me said unto me i will shew thee what these be
and the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said
these are they whom the lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the
earth
and they answered the angel of the lord that stood among the
myrtle trees and said we have walked to and fro through the earth
and behold all the earth sitteth still and is at rest
then the angel of the lord answered and said o lord of hosts
how long wilt thou not have mercy on jerusalem and on the cities of
judah against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and
ten years   and the lord answered the angel that talked with me
with good words and comfortable words
so the angel that communed with me said unto me cry thou
saying thus saith the lord of hosts i am jealous for jerusalem and
for zion with a great jealousy
and i am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease
for i was but a little displeased and they helped forward the
affliction
therefore thus saith the lord i am returned to jerusalem with
mercies my house shall be built in it saith the lord of hosts and a
line shall be stretched forth upon jerusalem
cry yet saying thus saith the lord of hosts my cities through
prosperity shall yet be spread abroad and the lord shall yet comfort
zion and shall yet choose jerusalem
then lifted i up mine eyes and saw and behold four horns
and i said unto the angel that talked with me what be these and
he answered me these are the horns which have scattered judah
israel and jerusalem
and the lord shewed me four carpenters
then said i what come these to do and he spake saying these
are the horns which have scattered judah so that no man did lift up
his head but these are come to fray them to cast out the horns of
the gentiles which lifted up their horn over the land of judah to
scatter it
i lifted up mine eyes again and looked and behold a man with a
measuring line in his hand
then said i whither goest thou and he said unto me to measure
jerusalem to see what is the breadth thereof and what is the length
thereof
and behold the angel that talked with me went forth and another
angel went out to meet him  and said unto him run speak to this
young man saying jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls
for the multitude of men and cattle therein  for i saith the
lord will be unto her a wall of fire round about and will be the
glory in the midst of her
ho ho come forth and flee from the land of the north saith the
lord for i have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven
saith the lord
deliver thyself o zion that dwellest with the daughter of
babylon
for thus saith the lord of hosts after the glory hath he sent me
unto the nations which spoiled you for he that toucheth you toucheth
the apple of his eye
for behold i will shake mine hand upon them and they shall be a
spoil to their servants and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath
sent me
sing and rejoice o daughter of zion for lo i come and i will
dwell in the midst of thee saith the lord
and many nations shall be joined to the lord in that day and
shall be my people and i will dwell in the midst of thee and thou
shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee
and the lord shall inherit judah his portion in the holy land
and shall choose jerusalem again
be silent o all flesh before the lord for he is raised up out
of his holy habitation
and he shewed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel
of the lord and satan standing at his right hand to resist him
and the lord said unto satan the lord rebuke thee o satan even
the lord that hath chosen jerusalem rebuke thee is not this a brand
plucked out of the fire   now joshua was clothed with filthy
garments and stood before the angel
and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him
saying take away the filthy garments from him and unto him he said
behold i have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and i will
clothe thee with change of raiment
and i said let them set a fair mitre upon his head so they set a
fair mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments and the angel
of the lord stood by
and the angel of the lord protested unto joshua saying  thus
saith the lord of hosts if thou wilt walk in my ways and if thou
wilt keep my charge then thou shalt also judge my house and shalt
also keep my courts and i will give thee places to walk among these
that stand by
hear now o joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit
before thee for they are men wondered at for behold i will bring
forth my servant the branch
for behold the stone that i have laid before joshua upon one
stone shall be seven eyes behold i will engrave the graving thereof
saith the lord of hosts and i will remove the iniquity of that land
in one day
in that day saith the lord of hosts shall ye call every man his
neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree
and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a
man that is wakened out of his sleep
and said unto me what seest thou and i said i have looked and
behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and
his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are
upon the top thereof  and two olive trees by it one upon the
right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof
so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying
what are these my lord   then the angel that talked with me
answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and i said
no my lord
then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of
the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by
my spirit saith the lord of hosts
who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt
become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with
shoutings crying grace grace unto it
moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying  the hands
of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall
also finish it and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent
me unto you
for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall
rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with
those seven they are the eyes of the lord which run to and fro
through the whole earth
then answered i and said unto him what are these two olive
trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side
thereof   and i answered again and said unto him what be these
two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden
oil out of themselves   and he answered me and said knowest thou
not what these be and i said no my lord
then said he these are the two anointed ones that stand by the
lord of the whole earth
then i turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a
flying roll
and he said unto me what seest thou and i answered i see a
flying roll the length thereof is twenty cubits and the breadth
thereof ten cubits
then said he unto me this is the curse that goeth forth over the
face of the whole earth for every one that stealeth shall be cut off
as on this side according to it and every one that sweareth shall be
cut off as on that side according to it
i will bring it forth saith the lord of hosts and it shall enter
into the house of the thief and into the house of him that sweareth
falsely by my name and it shall remain in the midst of his house and
shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof
then the angel that talked with me went forth and said unto me
lift up now thine eyes and see what is this that goeth forth
and i said what is it and he said this is an ephah that goeth
forth he said moreover this is their resemblance through all the
earth
and behold there was lifted up a talent of lead and this is a
woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah
and he said this is wickedness and he cast it into the midst of
the ephah and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof
then lifted i up mine eyes and looked and behold there came
out two women and the wind was in their wings for they had wings
like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the ephah between the
earth and the heaven
then said i to the angel that talked with me whither do these
bear the ephah   and he said unto me to build it an house in the
land of shinar and it shall be established and set there upon her
own base
and i turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold
there came four chariots out from between two mountains and the
mountains were mountains of brass
in the first chariot were red horses and in the second chariot
black horses  and in the third chariot white horses and in the
fourth chariot grisled and bay horses
then i answered and said unto the angel that talked with me what
are these my lord   and the angel answered and said unto me
these are the four spirits of the heavens which go forth from
standing before the lord of all the earth
the black horses which are therein go forth into the north
country and the white go forth after them and the grisled go forth
toward the south country
and the bay went forth and sought to go that they might walk to
and fro through the earth and he said get you hence walk to and fro
through the earth so they walked to and fro through the earth
then cried he upon me and spake unto me saying behold these
that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north
country
and the word of the lord came unto me saying  take of them
of the captivity even of heldai of tobijah and of jedaiah which
are come from babylon and come thou the same day and go into the
house of josiah the son of zephaniah  then take silver and gold
and make crowns and set them upon the head of joshua the son of
josedech the high priest  and speak unto him saying thus
speaketh the lord of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the
branch and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the
temple of the lord  even he shall build the temple of the lord
and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne
and he shall be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace
shall be between them both
and the crowns shall be to helem and to tobijah and to jedaiah
and to hen the son of zephaniah for a memorial in the temple of the
lord
and they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of
the lord and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto
you and this shall come to pass if ye will diligently obey the voice
of the lord your god
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king darius that the
word of the lord came unto zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth
month even in chisleu  when they had sent unto the house of god
sherezer and regemmelech and their men to pray before the lord
and to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the lord of
hosts and to the prophets saying should i weep in the fifth month
separating myself as i have done these so many years   then came
the word of the lord of hosts unto me saying  speak unto all the
people of the land and to the priests saying when ye fasted and
mourned in the fifth and seventh month even those seventy years did
ye at all fast unto me even to me   and when ye did eat and when
ye did drink did not ye eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves
should ye not hear the words which the lord hath cried by the
former prophets when jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity and
the cities thereof round about her when men inhabited the south and
the plain   and the word of the lord came unto zechariah saying
thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying execute true judgment
and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother  and
oppress not the widow nor the fatherless the stranger nor the poor
and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart
but they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and
stopped their ears that they should not hear
yea they made their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should
hear the law and the words which the lord of hosts hath sent in his
spirit by the former prophets therefore came a great wrath from the
lord of hosts
therefore it is come to pass that as he cried and they would
not hear so they cried and i would not hear saith the lord of
hosts  but i scattered them with a whirlwind among all the
nations whom they knew not thus the land was desolate after them
that no man passed through nor returned for they laid the pleasant
land desolate
again the word of the lord of hosts came to me saying  thus
saith the lord of hosts i was jealous for zion with great jealousy
and i was jealous for her with great fury
thus saith the lord i am returned unto zion and will dwell in
the midst of jerusalem and jerusalem shall be called a city of truth
and the mountain of the lord of hosts the holy mountain
thus saith the lord of hosts there shall yet old men and old
women dwell in the streets of jerusalem and every man with his staff
in his hand for very age
and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
playing in the streets thereof
thus saith the lord of hosts if it be marvellous in the eyes of
the remnant of this people in these days should it also be marvellous
in mine eyes saith the lord of hosts
thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will save my people from
the east country and from the west country  and i will bring
them and they shall dwell in the midst of jerusalem and they shall
be my people and i will be their god in truth and in righteousness
thus saith the lord of hosts let your hands be strong ye that
hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets which
were in the day that the foundation of the house of the lord of hosts
was laid that the temple might be built
for before these days there was no hire for man nor any hire for
beast neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in
because of the affliction for i set all men every one against his
neighbour
but now i will not be unto the residue of this people as in the
former days saith the lord of hosts
for the seed shall be prosperous the vine shall give her fruit
and the ground shall give her increase and the heavens shall give
their dew and i will cause the remnant of this people to possess all
these things
and it shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the
heathen o house of judah and house of israel so will i save you
and ye shall be a blessing fear not but let your hands be strong
for thus saith the lord of hosts as i thought to punish you
when your fathers provoked me to wrath saith the lord of hosts and i
repented not  so again have i thought in these days to do well
unto jerusalem and to the house of judah fear ye not
these are the things that ye shall do speak ye every man the
truth to his neighbour execute the judgment of truth and peace in
your gates  and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts
against his neighbour and love no false oath for all these are
things that i hate saith the lord
and the word of the lord of hosts came unto me saying  thus
saith the lord of hosts the fast of the fourth month and the fast of
the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth
shall be to the house of judah joy and gladness and cheerful feasts
therefore love the truth and peace
thus saith the lord of hosts it shall yet come to pass that
there shall come people and the inhabitants of many cities  and
the inhabitants of one city shall go to another saying let us go
speedily to pray before the lord and to seek the lord of hosts i
will go also
yea many people and strong nations shall come to seek the lord
of hosts in jerusalem and to pray before the lord
thus saith the lord of hosts in those days it shall come to
pass that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the
nations even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a jew
saying we will go with you for we have heard that god is with you
the burden of the word of the lord in the land of hadrach and
damascus shall be the rest thereof when the eyes of man as of all
the tribes of israel shall be toward the lord
and hamath also shall border thereby tyrus and zidon though it
be very wise
and tyrus did build herself a strong hold and heaped up silver as
the dust and fine gold as the mire of the streets
behold the lord will cast her out and he will smite her power in
the sea and she shall be devoured with fire
ashkelon shall see it and fear gaza also shall see it and be
very sorrowful and ekron for her expectation shall be ashamed and
the king shall perish from gaza and ashkelon shall not be inhabited
and a bastard shall dwell in ashdod and i will cut off the pride
of the philistines
and i will take away his blood out of his mouth and his
abominations from between his teeth but he that remaineth even he
shall be for our god and he shall be as a governor in judah and
ekron as a jebusite
and i will encamp about mine house because of the army because of
him that passeth by and because of him that returneth and no
oppressor shall pass through them any more for now have i seen with
mine eyes
rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of
jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having
salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of
an ass
and i will cut off the chariot from ephraim and the horse from
jerusalem and the battle bow shall be cut off and he shall speak
peace unto the heathen and his dominion shall be from sea even to
sea and from the river even to the ends of the earth
as for thee also by the blood of thy covenant i have sent forth
thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water
turn you to the strong hold ye prisoners of hope even to day do
i declare that i will render double unto thee  when i have bent
judah for me filled the bow with ephraim and raised up thy sons o
zion against thy sons o greece and made thee as the sword of a
mighty man
and the lord shall be seen over them and his arrow shall go
forth as the lightning and the lord god shall blow the trumpet and
shall go with whirlwinds of the south
the lord of hosts shall defend them and they shall devour and
subdue with sling stones and they shall drink and make a noise as
through wine and they shall be filled like bowls and as the corners
of the altar
and the lord their god shall save them in that day as the flock
of his people for they shall be as the stones of a crown lifted up
as an ensign upon his land
for how great is his goodness and how great is his beauty corn
shall make the young men cheerful and new wine the maids
ask ye of the lord rain in the time of the latter rain so the
lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to every
one grass in the field
for the idols have spoken vanity and the diviners have seen a
lie and have told false dreams they comfort in vain therefore they
went their way as a flock they were troubled because there was no
shepherd
mine anger was kindled against the shepherds and i punished the
goats for the lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house of
judah and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle
out of him came forth the corner out of him the nail out of him
the battle bow out of him every oppressor together
and they shall be as mighty men which tread down their enemies
in the mire of the streets in the battle and they shall fight
because the lord is with them and the riders on horses shall be
confounded
and i will strengthen the house of judah and i will save the
house of joseph and i will bring them again to place them for i have
mercy upon them and they shall be as though i had not cast them off
for i am the lord their god and will hear them
and they of ephraim shall be like a mighty man and their heart
shall rejoice as through wine yea their children shall see it and
be glad their heart shall rejoice in the lord
i will hiss for them and gather them for i have redeemed them
and they shall increase as they have increased
and i will sow them among the people and they shall remember me
in far countries and they shall live with their children and turn
again
i will bring them again also out of the land of egypt and
gather them out of assyria and i will bring them into the land of
gilead and lebanon and place shall not be found for them
and he shall pass through the sea with affliction and shall
smite the waves in the sea and all the deeps of the river shall dry
up and the pride of assyria shall be brought down and the sceptre of
egypt shall depart away
and i will strengthen them in the lord and they shall walk up
and down in his name saith the lord
open thy doors o lebanon that the fire may devour thy cedars
howl fir tree for the cedar is fallen because the mighty are
spoiled howl o ye oaks of bashan for the forest of the vintage is
come down
there is a voice of the howling of the shepherds for their glory
is spoiled a voice of the roaring of young lions for the pride of
jordan is spoiled
thus saith the lord my god feed the flock of the slaughter
whose possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty and they
that sell them say blessed be the lord for i am rich and their own
shepherds pity them not
for i will no more pity the inhabitants of the land saith the
lord but lo i will deliver the men every one into his neighbours
hand and into the hand of his king and they shall smite the land
and out of their hand i will not deliver them
and i will feed the flock of slaughter even you o poor of the
flock and i took unto me two staves the one i called beauty and the
other i called bands and i fed the flock
three shepherds also i cut off in one month and my soul lothed
them and their soul also abhorred me
then said i i will not feed you that that dieth let it die
and that that is to be cut off let it be cut off and let the rest
eat every one the flesh of another
and i took my staff even beauty and cut it asunder that i
might break my covenant which i had made with all the people
and it was broken in that day and so the poor of the flock that
waited upon me knew that it was the word of the lord
and i said unto them if ye think good give me my price and if
not forbear so they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver
and the lord said unto me cast it unto the potter a goodly
price that i was prised at of them and i took the thirty pieces of
silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the lord
then i cut asunder mine other staff even bands that i might
break the brotherhood between judah and israel
and the lord said unto me take unto thee yet the instruments of
a foolish shepherd
for lo i will raise up a shepherd in the land which shall not
visit those that be cut off neither shall seek the young one nor
heal that that is broken nor feed that that standeth still but he
shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their claws in pieces
woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock the sword shall
be upon his arm and upon his right eye his arm shall be clean dried
up and his right eye shall be utterly darkened
the burden of the word of the lord for israel saith the lord
which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the
earth and formeth the spirit of man within him
behold i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the
people round about when they shall be in the siege both against judah
and against jerusalem
and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all
people all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces
though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it
in that day saith the lord i will smite every horse with
astonishment and his rider with madness and i will open mine eyes
upon the house of judah and will smite every horse of the people with
blindness
and the governors of judah shall say in their heart the
inhabitants of jerusalem shall be my strength in the lord of hosts
their god
in that day will i make the governors of judah like an hearth of
fire among the wood and like a torch of fire in a sheaf and they
shall devour all the people round about on the right hand and on the
left and jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place even in
jerusalem
the lord also shall save the tents of judah first that the glory
of the house of david and the glory of the inhabitants of jerusalem do
not magnify themselves against judah
in that day shall the lord defend the inhabitants of jerusalem
and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david and
the house of david shall be as god as the angel of the lord before
them
and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to
destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem
and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the
inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications
and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall
mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in
bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn
in that day shall there be a great mourning in jerusalem as the
mourning of hadadrimmon in the valley of megiddon
and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the
house of david apart and their wives apart the family of the house
of nathan apart and their wives apart  the family of the house
of levi apart and their wives apart the family of shimei apart and
their wives apart  all the families that remain every family
apart and their wives apart
in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of
david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness
and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts
that i will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they
shall no more be remembered and also i will cause the prophets and
the unclean spirit to pass out of the land
and it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy then
his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him thou
shalt not live for thou speakest lies in the name of the lord and
his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when
he prophesieth
and it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be
ashamed every one of his vision when he hath prophesied neither
shall they wear a rough garment to deceive  but he shall say i
am no prophet i am an husbandman for man taught me to keep cattle
from my youth
and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thine hands
then he shall answer those with which i was wounded in the house of
my friends
awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is
my fellow saith the lord of hosts smite the shepherd and the sheep
shall be scattered and i will turn mine hand upon the little ones
and it shall come to pass that in all the land saith the lord
two parts therein shall be cut off and die but the third shall be
left therein
and i will bring the third part through the fire and will refine
them as silver is refined and will try them as gold is tried they
shall call on my name and i will hear them i will say it is my
people and they shall say the lord is my god
behold the day of the lord cometh and thy spoil shall be
divided in the midst of thee
for i will gather all nations against jerusalem to battle and
the city shall be taken and the houses rifled and the women
ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the
residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city
then shall the lord go forth and fight against those nations as
when he fought in the day of battle
and his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives
which is before jerusalem on the east and the mount of olives shall
cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west and
there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountain shall
remove toward the north and half of it toward the south
and ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains for the valley
of the mountains shall reach unto azal yea ye shall flee like as ye
fled from before the earthquake in the days of uzziah king of judah
and the lord my god shall come and all the saints with thee
and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not
be clear nor dark  but it shall be one day which shall be known
to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at
evening time it shall be light
and it shall be in that day that living waters shall go out from
jerusalem half of them toward the former sea and half of them toward
the hinder sea in summer and in winter shall it be
and the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day shall
there be one lord and his name one
all the land shall be turned as a plain from geba to rimmon
south of jerusalem and it shall be lifted up and inhabited in her
place from benjamins gate unto the place of the first gate unto the
corner gate and from the tower of hananeel unto the kings
winepresses
and men shall dwell in it and there shall be no more utter
destruction but jerusalem shall be safely inhabited
and this shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite all
the people that have fought against jerusalem their flesh shall
consume away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes shall
consume away in their holes and their tongue shall consume away in
their mouth
and it shall come to pass in that day that a great tumult from
the lord shall be among them and they shall lay hold every one on the
hand of his neighbour and his hand shall rise up against the hand of
his neighbour
and judah also shall fight at jerusalem and the wealth of all
the heathen round about shall be gathered together gold and silver
and apparel in great abundance
and so shall be the plague of the horse of the mule of the
camel and of the ass and of all the beasts that shall be in these
tents as this plague
and it shall come to pass that every one that is left of all
the nations which came against jerusalem shall even go up from year to
year to worship the king the lord of hosts and to keep the feast of
tabernacles
and it shall be that whoso will not come up of all the families
of the earth unto jerusalem to worship the king the lord of hosts
even upon them shall be no rain
and if the family of egypt go not up and come not that have no
rain there shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite the
heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles
this shall be the punishment of egypt and the punishment of all
nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles
in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses
holiness unto the lord and the pots in the lords house shall be like
the bowls before the altar
yea every pot in jerusalem and in judah shall be holiness unto
the lord of hosts and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of
them and seethe therein and in that day there shall be no more the
canaanite in the house of the lord of hosts
malachi
the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi
i have loved you saith the lord yet ye say wherein hast thou
loved us was not esau jacobs brother saith the lord yet i loved
jacob  and i hated esau and laid his mountains and his heritage
waste for the dragons of the wilderness
whereas edom saith we are impoverished but we will return and
build the desolate places thus saith the lord of hosts they shall
build but i will throw down and they shall call them the border of
wickedness and the people against whom the lord hath indignation for
ever
and your eyes shall see and ye shall say the lord will be
magnified from the border of israel
a son honoureth his father and a servant his master if then i be
a father where is mine honour and if i be a master where is my
fear saith the lord of hosts unto you o priests that despise my
name and ye say wherein have we despised thy name   ye offer
polluted bread upon mine altar and ye say wherein have we polluted
thee in that ye say the table of the lord is contemptible
and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if ye
offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy
governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person saith
the lord of hosts
and now i pray you beseech god that he will be gracious unto us
this hath been by your means will he regard your persons saith the
lord of hosts
who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought
neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought i have no pleasure
in you saith the lord of hosts neither will i accept an offering at
your hand
for from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the
same my name shall be great among the gentiles and in every place
incense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering for my
name shall be great among the heathen saith the lord of hosts
but ye have profaned it in that ye say the table of the lord is
polluted and the fruit thereof even his meat is contemptible
ye said also behold what a weariness is it and ye have snuffed
at it saith the lord of hosts and ye brought that which was torn
and the lame and the sick thus ye brought an offering should i
accept this of your hand saith the lord
but cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and
voweth and sacrificeth unto the lord a corrupt thing for i am a
great king saith the lord of hosts and my name is dreadful among the
heathen
and now o ye priests this commandment is for you
if ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart to give
glory unto my name saith the lord of hosts i will even send a curse
upon you and i will curse your blessings yea i have cursed them
already because ye do not lay it to heart
behold i will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your faces
even the dung of your solemn feasts and one shall take you away with
it
and ye shall know that i have sent this commandment unto you that
my covenant might be with levi saith the lord of hosts
my covenant was with him of life and peace and i gave them to him
for the fear wherewith he feared me and was afraid before my name
the law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found in
his lips he walked with me in peace and equity and did turn many
away from iniquity
for the priests lips should keep knowledge and they should seek
the law at his mouth for he is the messenger of the lord of hosts
but ye are departed out of the way ye have caused many to stumble
at the law ye have corrupted the covenant of levi saith the lord of
hosts
therefore have i also made you contemptible and base before all
the people according as ye have not kept my ways but have been
partial in the law
have we not all one father hath not one god created us why do
we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the
covenant of our fathers   judah hath dealt treacherously and an
abomination is committed in israel and in jerusalem for judah hath
profaned the holiness of the lord which he loved and hath married the
daughter of a strange god
the lord will cut off the man that doeth this the master and the
scholar out of the tabernacles of jacob and him that offereth an
offering unto the lord of hosts
and this have ye done again covering the altar of the lord with
tears with weeping and with crying out insomuch that he regardeth
not the offering any more or receiveth it with good will at your
hand
yet ye say wherefore because the lord hath been witness between
thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealt
treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant
and did not he make one yet had he the residue of the spirit
and wherefore one that he might seek a godly seed therefore take
heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife
of his youth
for the lord the god of israel saith that he hateth putting
away for one covereth violence with his garment saith the lord of
hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that ye deal not
treacherously
ye have wearied the lord with your words yet ye say wherein
have we wearied him when ye say every one that doeth evil is good in
the sight of the lord and he delighteth in them or where is the god
of judgment   behold i will send my messenger and he shall
prepare the way before me and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly
come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom ye
delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts
but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when
he appeareth for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers soap
and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall
purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that they
may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness
then shall the offering of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto
the lord as in the days of old and as in former years
and i will come near to you to judgment and i will be a swift
witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against
false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his
wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger
from his right and fear not me saith the lord of hosts
for i am the lord i change not therefore ye sons of jacob are
not consumed
even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and i will return
unto you saith the lord of hosts but ye said wherein shall we
return   will a man rob god yet ye have robbed me but ye say
wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings
ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole
nation
bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be
meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the lord of
hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out
a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it
and i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes and he shall not
destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your vine cast her
fruit before the time in the field saith the lord of hosts
and all nations shall call you blessed for ye shall be a
delightsome land saith the lord of hosts
your words have been stout against me saith the lord yet ye
say what have we spoken so much against thee   ye have said it
is vain to serve god and what profit is it that we have kept his
ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the lord of
hosts   and now we call the proud happy yea they that work
wickedness are set up yea they that tempt god are even delivered
then they that feared the lord spake often one to another and
the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was
written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought
upon his name
and they shall be mine saith the lord of hosts in that day when
i make up my jewels and i will spare them as a man spareth his own
son that serveth him
then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the
wicked between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not
for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all
the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the
day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it
shall leave them neither root nor branch
but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness
arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as
calves of the stall
and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under
the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lord
of hosts
remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto
him in horeb for all israel with the statutes and judgments
behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of
the great and dreadful day of the lord  and he shall turn the
heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to
their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse

fourteen generations and from the carrying away into babylon unto
christ are fourteen generations
now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his
mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was
found with child of the holy ghost
then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to
make her a publick example was minded to put her away privily
but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the
lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david
fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived
in her is of the holy ghost
and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name
jesus for he shall save his people from their sins
now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken of the lord by the prophet saying  behold a virgin shall
be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his
name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us
then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord
had bidden him and took unto him his wife  and knew her not till
she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus
now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of
herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to
jerusalem  saying where is he that is born king of the jews for
we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him
when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and
all jerusalem with him
and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the
people together he demanded of them where christ should be born
and they said unto him in bethlehem of judaea for thus it is
written by the prophet  and thou bethlehem in the land of juda
art not the least among the princes of juda for out of thee shall
come a governor that shall rule my people israel
then herod when he had privily called the wise men enquired of
them diligently what time the star appeared
and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently
for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again
that i may come and worship him also
when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star
which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood
over where the young child was
when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
and when they were come into the house they saw the young child
with mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they
had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and
frankincense and myrrh
and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to
herod they departed into their own country another way
and when they were departed behold the angel of the lord
appeareth to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young
child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i
bring thee word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him
when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night
and departed into egypt  and was there until the death of herod
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the
prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son
then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was
exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were
in bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and
under according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the
wise men
then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet
saying  in rama was there a voice heard lamentation and
weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and
would not be comforted because they are not
but when herod was dead behold an angel of the lord appeareth
in a dream to joseph in egypt  saying arise and take the young
child and his mother and go into the land of israel for they are
dead which sought the young childs life
and he arose and took the young child and his mother and came
into the land of israel
but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the room
of his father herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstanding
being warned of god in a dream he turned aside into the parts of
galilee  and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be
called a nazarene
in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness
of judaea  and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at
hand
for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias saying
the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the
lord make his paths straight
and the same john had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern
girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey
then went out to him jerusalem and all judaea and all the region
round about jordan  and were baptized of him in jordan confessing
their sins
but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his
baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warned
you to flee from the wrath to come   bring forth therefore fruits
meet for repentance  and think not to say within yourselves we
have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of
these stones to raise up children unto abraham
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees
therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down
and cast into the fire
i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that
cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to
bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire
whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and
gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with
unquenchable fire
then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be
baptized of him
but john forbad him saying i have need to be baptized of thee
and comest thou to me   and jesus answering said unto him suffer
it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness
then he suffered him
and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the
water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the
spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him  and
lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am
well pleased
then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be
tempted of the devil
and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was
afterward an hungred
and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of
god command that these stones be made bread
but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by
bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
god
then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him
on a pinnacle of the temple  and saith unto him if thou be the
son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his
angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee
up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone
jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the
lord thy god
again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain
and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou
wilt fall down and worship me
then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it is
written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou
serve
then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and
ministered unto him
now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he
departed into galilee  and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in
capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon and
nephthalim  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias
the prophet saying  the land of zabulon and the land of
nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the
gentiles  the people which sat in darkness saw great light and
to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung
up
from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand
and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon
called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for
they were fishers
and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of
men
and they straightway left their nets and followed him
and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the
son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their
father mending their nets and he called them
and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed
him
and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of
sickness and all manner of disease among the people
and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto him
all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and
those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick
and those that had the palsy and he healed them
and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee
and from decapolis and from jerusalem and from judaea and from
beyond jordan
and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he
was set his disciples came unto him  and he opened his mouth and
taught them saying  blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is
the kingdom of heaven
blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness
for they shall be filled
blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy
blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god
blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children
of god
blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and
shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake
rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in
heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you
ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his
savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for
nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men
ye are the light of the world a city that is set on an hill
cannot be hid
neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on
a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house
let your light so shine before men that they may see your good
works and glorify your father which is in heaven
think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i
am not come to destroy but to fulfil
for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or
one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled
whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments
and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven
for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed
the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case
enter into the kingdom of heaven
ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt
not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment
but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother
without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever
shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council but
whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire
therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there
rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee  leave there
thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy
brother and then come and offer thy gift
agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way
with him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge
and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into
prison
verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence
till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing
ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt
not commit adultery  but i say unto you that whosoever looketh
on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already
in his heart
and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from
thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should
perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from
thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should
perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him
give her a writing of divorcement  but i say unto you that
whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of
fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry
her that is divorced committeth adultery
again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time
thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine
oaths  but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven
for it is gods throne  nor by the earth for it is his
footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king
neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make
one hair white or black
but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever
is more than these cometh of evil
ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth  but i say unto you that ye resist not evil
but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the
other also
and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat
let him have thy cloak also
and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain
give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of
thee turn not thou away
ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy
neighbour and hate thine enemy
but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you
do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully
use you and persecute you  that ye may be the children of your
father which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil
and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust
for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not
even the publicans the same   and if ye salute your brethren
only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so
be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is
perfect
take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them
otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven
therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet
before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they
have their reward
but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy
right hand doeth  that thine alms may be in secret and thy father
which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly
and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are
for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of
the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they
have their reward
but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou
hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy
father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly
but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for
they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking
be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what
things ye have need of before ye ask him
after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in
heaven hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for
thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever amen
for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will
also forgive you  but if ye forgive not men their trespasses
neither will your father forgive your trespasses
moreover when ye fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad
countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto
men to fast verily i say unto you they have their reward
but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy
face  that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father
which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall
reward thee openly
lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and
rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal  but
lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust
doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal
for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be
single thy whole body shall be full of light
but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of
darkness
if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that
darkness   no man can serve two masters for either he will hate
the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and
despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon
therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye
shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye
shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than
raiment   behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither
do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth
them are ye not much better than they   which of you by taking
thought can add one cubit unto his stature   and why take ye
thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow
they toil not neither do they spin  and yet i say unto you that
even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these
wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which to day
is and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe
you o ye of little faith   therefore take no thought saying
what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we
be clothed   for after all these things do the gentiles seek
for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these
things
but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and
all these things shall be added unto you
take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall
take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the
evil thereof
judge not that ye be not judged
for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what
measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but
considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye   or how wilt
thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye
and behold a beam is in thine own eye   thou hypocrite first
cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see
clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye
give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your
pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn
again and rend you
ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock
and it shall be opened unto you  for every one that asketh
receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it
shall be opened
or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he
give him a stone   or if he ask a fish will he give him a
serpent   if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts
unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven
give good things to them that ask him   therefore all things
whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them
for this is the law and the prophets
enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad
is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in
thereat  because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which
leadeth unto life and few there be that find it
beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing
but inwardly they are ravening wolves
ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of
thorns or figs of thistles   even so every good tree bringeth
forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit
a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt
tree bring forth good fruit
every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and
cast into the fire
wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them
not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which
is in heaven
many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not
prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in
thy name done many wonderful works   and then will i profess unto
them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity
therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a
rock  and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds
blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded
upon a rock
and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them
not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon
the sand  and the rain descended and the floods came and the
winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the
fall of it
and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the
people were astonished at his doctrine  for he taught them as one
having authority and not as the scribes
when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed
him
and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord
if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
and jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be
thou clean and immediately his leprosy was cleansed
and jesus saith unto him see thou tell no man but go thy way
shew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded
for a testimony unto them
and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a
centurion beseeching him  and saying lord my servant lieth at
home sick of the palsy grievously tormented
and jesus saith unto him i will come and heal him
the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou
shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant
shall be healed
for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i
say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he
cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it
when jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that
followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no
not in israel
and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and west
and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom
of heaven
but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and as thou hast
believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the
selfsame hour
and when jesus was come into peters house he saw his wifes
mother laid and sick of a fever
and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose
and ministered unto them
when the even was come they brought unto him many that were
possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and
healed all that were sick  that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by esaias the prophet saying himself took our infirmities
and bare our sicknesses
now when jesus saw great multitudes about him he gave
commandment to depart unto the other side
and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will
follow thee whithersoever thou goest
and jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of
the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
and another of his disciples said unto him lord suffer me first
to go and bury my father
but jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury their
dead
and when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him
and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea insomuch
that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep
and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save
us we perish
and he saith unto them why are ye fearful o ye of little faith
then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a
great calm
but the men marvelled saying what manner of man is this that
even the winds and the sea obey him   and when he was come to the
other side into the country of the gergesenes there met him two
possessed with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fierce so
that no man might pass by that way
and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with
thee jesus thou son of god art thou come hither to torment us
before the time   and there was a good way off from them an herd
of many swine feeding
so the devils besought him saying if thou cast us out suffer
us to go away into the herd of swine
and he said unto them go and when they were come out they went
into the herd of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran
violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters
and they that kept them fled and went their ways into the city
and told every thing and what was befallen to the possessed of the
devils
and behold the whole city came out to meet jesus and when they
saw him they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts
and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own
city
and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on
a bed and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy
son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee
and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this
man blasphemeth
and jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in
your hearts   for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven
thee or to say arise and walk   but that ye may know that the
son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the
sick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house
and he arose and departed to his house
but when the multitudes saw it they marvelled and glorified god
which had given such power unto men
and as jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named
matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him
follow me and he arose and followed him
and it came to pass as jesus sat at meat in the house behold
many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his
disciples
and when the pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why
eateth your master with publicans and sinners   but when jesus
heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a
physician but they that are sick
but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and not
sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to
repentance
then came to him the disciples of john saying why do we and the
pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not   and jesus said
unto them can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the
bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom
shall be taken from them and then shall they fast
no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for that
which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is
made worse
neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles
break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they put
new wine into new bottles and both are preserved
while he spake these things unto them behold there came a
certain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now
dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live
and jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples
and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood
twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment
for she said within herself if i may but touch his garment i
shall be whole
but jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said
daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and the
woman was made whole from that hour
and when jesus came into the rulers house and saw the minstrels
and the people making a noise  he said unto them give place for
the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn
but when the people were put forth he went in and took her by
the hand and the maid arose
and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land
and when jesus departed thence two blind men followed him
crying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us
and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him
and jesus saith unto them believe ye that i am able to do this they
said unto him yea lord
then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it
unto you
and their eyes were opened and jesus straitly charged them
saying see that no man know it
but they when they were departed spread abroad his fame in all
that country
as they went out behold they brought to him a dumb man
possessed with a devil
and when the devil was cast out the dumb spake and the
multitudes marvelled saying it was never so seen in israel
but the pharisees said he casteth out devils through the prince
of the devils
and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in
their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing
every sickness and every disease among the people
but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on
them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having
no shepherd
then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous
but the labourers are few  pray ye therefore the lord of the
harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave
them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all
manner of sickness and all manner of disease
now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon
who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee
and john his brother  philip and bartholomew thomas and
matthew the publican james the son of alphaeus and lebbaeus whose
surname was thaddaeus  simon the canaanite and judas iscariot
who also betrayed him
these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not
into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans
enter ye not  but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of
israel
and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand
heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out
devils freely ye have received freely give
provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses
nor scrip for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet
staves for the workman is worthy of his meat
and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter enquire who in
it is worthy and there abide till ye go thence
and when ye come into an house salute it
and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if
it be not worthy let your peace return to you
and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when
ye depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet
verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land
of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city
behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye
therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves
but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils
and they will scourge you in their synagogues  and ye shall be
brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony
against them and the gentiles
but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye
shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall
speak
for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which
speaketh in you
and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the
father the child and the children shall rise up against their
parents and cause them to be put to death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that
endureth to the end shall be saved
but when they persecute you in this city flee ye into another
for verily i say unto you ye shall not have gone over the cities of
israel till the son of man be come
the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his
lord
it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the
servant as his lord if they have called the master of the house
beelzebub how much more shall they call them of his household
fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not
be revealed and hid that shall not be known
what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye
hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops
and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill
the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and
body in hell
are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall
not fall on the ground without your father
but the very hairs of your head are all numbered
fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows
whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i
confess also before my father which is in heaven
but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny
before my father which is in heaven
think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to
send peace but a sword
for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and
the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her
mother in law
and a mans foes shall be they of his own household
he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of
me
and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not
worthy of me
he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his
life for my sake shall find it
he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me
receiveth him that sent me
he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
receive a prophets reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in
the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward
and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones
a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto
you he shall in no wise lose his reward
and it came to pass when jesus had made an end of commanding his
twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their
cities
now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he
sent two of his disciples  and said unto him art thou he that
should come or do we look for another   jesus answered and said
unto them go and shew john again those things which ye do hear and
see  the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers
are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor
have the gospel preached to them
and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me
and as they departed jesus began to say unto the multitudes
concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness to see a reed
shaken with the wind   but what went ye out for to see a man
clothed in soft raiment  behold they that wear soft clothing are in
kings houses
but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you
and more than a prophet
for this is he of whom it is written behold i send my
messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there
hath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he
that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of
heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force
for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john
and if ye will receive it this is elias which was for to come
he that hath ears to hear let him hear
but whereunto shall i liken this generation it is like unto
children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows
and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have
mourned unto you and ye have not lamented
for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath
a devil
the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a
man gluttonous and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners
but wisdom is justified of her children
then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
works were done because they repented not  woe unto thee
chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works which
were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have
repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes
but i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for tyre and
sidon at the day of judgment than for you
and thou capernaum which art exalted unto heaven shalt be
brought down to hell for if the mighty works which have been done in
thee had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day
but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land
of sodom in the day of judgment than for thee
at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father
lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the
wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes
even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man
knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father
save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him
come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will
give you rest
take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly
in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls
for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn and
his disciples were an hungred and began to pluck the ears of corn and
to eat
but when the pharisees saw it they said unto him behold thy
disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day
but he said unto them have ye not read what david did when he
was an hungred and they that were with him  how he entered into
the house of god and did eat the shewbread which was not lawful for
him to eat neither for them which were with him but only for the
priests   or have ye not read in the law how that on the sabbath
days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless
but i say unto you that in this place is one greater than the
temple
but if ye had known what this meaneth i will have mercy and not
sacrifice ye would not have condemned the guiltless
for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day
and when he was departed thence he went into their synagogue
and behold there was a man which had his hand withered and
they asked him saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days that
they might accuse him
and he said unto them what man shall there be among you that
shall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day
will he not lay hold on it and lift it out   how much then is a
man better than a sheep wherefore it is lawful to do well on the
sabbath days
then saith he to the man stretch forth thine hand and he
stretched it forth and it was restored whole like as the other
then the pharisees went out and held a council against him how
they might destroy him
but when jesus knew it he withdrew himself from thence and
great multitudes followed him and he healed them all  and
charged them that they should not make him known  that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying
behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is
well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall shew
judgment to the gentiles
he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his
voice in the streets
a bruised reed shall he not break and smoking flax shall he not
quench till he send forth judgment unto victory
and in his name shall the gentiles trust
then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and
dumb and he healed him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake
and saw
and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of
david   but when the pharisees heard it they said this fellow
doth not cast out devils but by beelzebub the prince of the devils
and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every kingdom
divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or
house divided against itself shall not stand  and if satan cast
out satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom
stand   and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your
children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges
but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom
of god is come unto you
or else how can one enter into a strong mans house and spoil
his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil
his house
he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth abroad
wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall
be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall
not be forgiven unto men
and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall
be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it
shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world
to come
either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the
tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his
fruit
o generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good
things  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh
a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth
good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth
evil things
but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak
they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment
for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou
shalt be condemned
then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered
saying master we would see a sign from thee
but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous
generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to
it but the sign of the prophet jonas  for as jonas was three
days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the son of man be
three days and three nights in the heart of the earth
the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation
and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas
and behold a greater than jonas is here
the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost
parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a
greater than solomon is here
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through
dry places seeking rest and findeth none
then he saith i will return into my house from whence i came
out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished
then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more
wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last
state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also
unto this wicked generation
while he yet talked to the people behold his mother and his
brethren stood without desiring to speak with him
then one said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren
stand without desiring to speak with thee
but he answered and said unto him that told him who is my
mother  and who are my brethren   and he stretched forth his
hand toward his disciples and said behold my mother and my brethren
for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven
the same is my brother and sister and mother
the same day went jesus out of the house and sat by the sea
side
and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he
went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore
and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a
sower went forth to sow  and when he sowed some seeds fell by
the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up  some fell
upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they
sprung up because they had no deepness of earth  and when the
sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they
withered away
and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked
them  but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit
some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold
who hath ears to hear let him hear
and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou
unto them in parables   he answered and said unto them because
it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
but to them it is not given
for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have
more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away
even that he hath
therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see
not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand
and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias which saith by
hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall
see and shall not perceive  for this peoples heart is waxed
gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have
closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with
their ears and should understand with their heart and should be
converted and i should heal them
but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they
hear
for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men
have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them
and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them
hear ye therefore the parable of the sower
when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth
it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was
sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way side
but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he
that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it  yet hath
he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation
or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended
he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth
the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches
choke the word and he becometh unfruitful
but he that received seed into the good ground is he that
heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and
bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixty some thirty
another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of
heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field
but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat
and went his way
but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then
appeared the tares also
so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir
didst not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it
tares   he said unto them an enemy hath done this the servants
said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up
but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up also
the wheat with them
let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of
harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares
and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my
barn
another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of
heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed
in his field  which indeed is the least of all seeds but when
it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so
that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof
another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is
like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of
meal till the whole was leavened
all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables and
without a parable spake he not unto them  that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my
mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret
from the foundation of the world
then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and
his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of
the tares of the field
he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is
the son of man  the field is the world the good seed are the
children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked
one  the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the
end of the world and the reapers are the angels
as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so
shall it be in the end of this world
the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall
gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do
iniquity  and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there
shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear
again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof
goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field
again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man
seeking goodly pearls  who when he had found one pearl of great
price went and sold all that he had and bought it
again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast
into the sea and gathered of every kind  which when it was
full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into
vessels but cast the bad away
so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come
forth and sever the wicked from among the just  and shall cast
them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of
teeth
jesus saith unto them have ye understood all these things they
say unto him yea lord
then said he unto them therefore every scribe which is
instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and
old
and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these
parables he departed thence
and when he was come into his own country he taught them in
their synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said whence
hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works   is not this
the carpenters son is not his mother called mary and his brethren
james and joses and simon and judas   and his sisters are
they not all with us whence then hath this man all these things
and they were offended in him but jesus said unto them a
prophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his own
house
and he did not many mighty works there because of their
unbelief
at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus
and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen from
the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in
prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife
for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her
and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude
because they counted him as a prophet
but when herods birthday was kept the daughter of herodias
danced before them and pleased herod
whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
would ask
and she being before instructed of her mother said give me
here john baptists head in a charger
and the king was sorry nevertheless for the oaths sake and
them which sat with him at meat he commanded it to be given her
and he sent and beheaded john in the prison
and his head was brought in a charger and given to the damsel
and she brought it to her mother
and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and
went and told jesus
when jesus heard of it he departed thence by ship into a desert
place apart and when the people had heard thereof they followed him
on foot out of the cities
and jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved
with compassion toward them and he healed their sick
and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this
is a desert place and the time is now past send the multitude away
that they may go into the villages and buy themselves victuals
but jesus said unto them they need not depart give ye them to
eat
and they say unto him we have here but five loaves and two
fishes
he said bring them hither to me
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and
took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he
blessed and brake and gave the loaves to his disciples and the
disciples to the multitude
and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the
fragments that remained twelve baskets full
and they that had eaten were about five thousand men beside
women and children
and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the
multitudes away
and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a
mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there
alone
but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves
for the wind was contrary
and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them
walking on the sea
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were
troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear
but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer
it is i be not afraid
and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me
come unto thee on the water
and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship
he walked on the water to go to jesus
but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and
beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me
and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him
and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt
and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased
then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him saying
of a truth thou art the son of god
and when they were gone over they came into the land of
gennesaret
and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent
out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that
were diseased  and besought him that they might only touch the
hem of his garment and as many as touched were made perfectly whole
then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were of
jerusalem saying  why do thy disciples transgress the tradition
of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread
but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the
commandment of god by your tradition   for god commanded saying
honour thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother
let him die the death
but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it
is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me  and
honour not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have ye
made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition
ye hypocrites well did esaias prophesy of you saying  this
people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with
their lips but their heart is far from me
but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men
and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and
understand  not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man
but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man
then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that
the pharisees were offended after they heard this saying   but
he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not
planted shall be rooted up
let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the
blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch
then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this
parable
and jesus said are ye also yet without understanding   do
not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth
into the belly and is cast out into the draught   but those
things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and
they defile the man
for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries
fornications thefts false witness blasphemies  these are the
things which defile a man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not
a man
then jesus went thence and departed into the coasts of tyre and
sidon
and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts and
cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david
my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil
but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and
besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us
but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep
of the house of israel
then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me
but he answered and said it is not meet to take the childrens
bread and to cast it to dogs
and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
fall from their masters table
then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy
faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made
whole from that very hour
and jesus departed from thence and came nigh unto the sea of
galilee and went up into a mountain and sat down there
and great multitudes came unto him having with them those that
were lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down at
jesus feet and he healed them  insomuch that the multitude
wondered when they saw the dumb to speak the maimed to be whole the
lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorified the god of
israel
then jesus called his disciples unto him and said i have
compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three
days and have nothing to eat and i will not send them away fasting
lest they faint in the way
and his disciples say unto him whence should we have so much
bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude   and
jesus saith unto them how many loaves have ye and they said seven
and a few little fishes
and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground
and he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks
and brake them and gave to his disciples and the disciples to the
multitude
and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the
broken meat that was left seven baskets full
and they that did eat were four thousand men beside women and
children
and he sent away the multitude and took ship and came into the
coasts of magdala
the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desired
him that he would shew them a sign from heaven
he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say it
will be fair weather for the sky is red
and in the morning it will be foul weather to day for the sky
is red and lowering o ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the
sky but can ye not discern the signs of the times   a wicked and
adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be
given unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left them
and departed
and when his disciples were come to the other side they had
forgotten to take bread
then jesus said unto them take heed and beware of the leaven of
the pharisees and of the sadducees
and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have
taken no bread
which when jesus perceived he said unto them o ye of little
faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have brought no
bread   do ye not yet understand neither remember the five
loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets ye took up
neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets ye
took up   how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it
not to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leaven of
the pharisees and of the sadducees   then understood they how
that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the
doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees
when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi he asked
his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am
and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some
elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets
he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am   and simon
peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living
god
and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon
barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my
father which is in heaven
and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this
rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it
and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and
whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that
he was jesus the christ
from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples how
that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders
and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the
third day
then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far
from thee lord this shall not be unto thee
but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan
thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be
of god but those that be of men
then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after
me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever
will lose his life for my sake shall find it
for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world
and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his
soul   for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father
with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his
works
verily i say unto you there be some standing here which shall
not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his
kingdom
and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his
brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart  and
was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and
his raiment was white as the light
and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking
with him
then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us
to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for
thee and one for moses and one for elias
while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and
behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son
in whom i am well pleased hear ye him
and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and
were sore afraid
and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not
afraid
and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save
jesus only
and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them
saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again
from the dead
and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes
that elias must first come   and jesus answered and said unto
them elias truly shall first come and restore all things
but i say unto you that elias is come already and they knew
him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall
also the son of man suffer of them
then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john
the baptist
and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a
certain man kneeling down to him and saying  lord have mercy
on my son for he is lunatick and sore vexed for ofttimes he falleth
into the fire and oft into the water
and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him
then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse
generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you
bring him hither to me
and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the
child was cured from that very hour
then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not
we cast him out   and jesus said unto them because of your
unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of
mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder
place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you
howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting
and while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them the son
of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men  and they shall
kill him and the third day he shall be raised again
and they were exceeding sorry
and when they were come to capernaum they that received tribute
money came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribute
he saith yes and when he was come into the house jesus
prevented him saying what thinkest thou simon of whom do the kings
of the earth take custom or tribute of their own children or of
strangers   peter saith unto him of strangers jesus saith unto
him then are the children free
notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea
and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when
thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that
take and give unto them for me and thee
at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is
the greatest in the kingdom of heaven   and jesus called a little
child unto him and set him in the midst of them  and said
verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little
children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven
whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child
the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven
and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
receiveth me
but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in
me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea
woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that
offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh
wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast
them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or
maimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into
everlasting fire
and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from
thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather
than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire
take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i
say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of
my father which is in heaven
for the son of man is come to save that which was lost
how think ye if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them be
gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the
mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray   and if so be
that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that
sheep than of the ninety and nine which went not astray
even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven
that one of these little ones should perish
moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell
him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou
hast gained thy brother
but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two
more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be
established
and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church
but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an
heathen man and a publican
verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be
loosed in heaven
again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as
touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of
my father which is in heaven
for where two or three are gathered together in my name there
am i in the midst of them
then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother
sin against me and i forgive him till seven times   jesus
saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until
seventy times seven
therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king
which would take account of his servants
and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which
owed him ten thousand talents
but forasmuch as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be
sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to
be made
the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying
lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all
then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and
loosed him and forgave him the debt
but the same servant went out and found one of his
fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on
him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest
and his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him
saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all
and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he
should pay the debt
so when his fellowservants saw what was done they were very
sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done
then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o
thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou
desiredst me  shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
fellowservant even as i had pity on thee   and his lord was
wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all
that was due unto him
so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye
from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses
and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these sayings
he departed from galilee and came into the coasts of judaea beyond
jordan  and great multitudes followed him and he healed them
there
the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto
him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause
and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he
which made them at the beginning made them male and female  and
said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall
cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh   wherefore
they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined
together let not man put asunder
they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing
of divorcement and to put her away   he saith unto them moses
because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your
wives but from the beginning it was not so
and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it
be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and
whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery
his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with
his wife it is not good to marry
but he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying save
they to whom it is given
for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their
mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of
men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the
kingdom of heavens sake he that is able to receive it let him
receive it
then were there brought unto him little children that he should
put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them
but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to
come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven
and he laid his hands on them and departed thence
and behold one came and said unto him good master what good
thing shall i do that i may have eternal life   and he said
unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that
is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments
he saith unto him which jesus said thou shalt do no murder
thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not
bear false witness  honour thy father and thy mother and thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
the young man saith unto him all these things have i kept from
my youth up what lack i yet   jesus said unto him if thou wilt
be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou
shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me
but when the young man heard that saying he went away
sorrowful for he had great possessions
then said jesus unto his disciples verily i say unto you that
a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven
and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
god
when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed
saying who then can be saved   but jesus beheld them and said
unto them with men this is impossible but with god all things are
possible
then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken
all and followed thee what shall we have therefore   and jesus
said unto them verily i say unto you that ye which have followed me
in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his
glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve
tribes of israel
and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or
sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my
names sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit
everlasting life
but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be
first
for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
householder which went out early in the morning to hire labourers
into his vineyard
and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day he
sent them into his vineyard
and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing
idle in the marketplace  and said unto them go ye also into the
vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you and they went their
way
again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did
likewise
and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others
standing idle and saith unto them why stand ye here all the day
idle   they say unto him because no man hath hired us he saith
unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that
shall ye receive
so when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
steward call the labourers and give them their hire beginning from
the last unto the first
and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they
received every man a penny
but when the first came they supposed that they should have
received more and they likewise received every man a penny
and when they had received it they murmured against the goodman
of the house  saying these last have wrought but one hour and
thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and
heat of the day
but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no
wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny   take that
thine is and go thy way i will give unto this last even as unto
thee
is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own is
thine eye evil because i am good   so the last shall be first
and the first last for many be called but few chosen
and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart
in the way and said unto them  behold we go up to jerusalem
and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto
the scribes and they shall condemn him to death  and shall
deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify
him and the third day he shall rise again
then came to him the mother of zebedees children with her sons
worshipping him and desiring a certain thing of him
and he said unto her what wilt thou she saith unto him grant
that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the
other on the left in thy kingdom
but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask are ye
able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptized
with the baptism that i am baptized with they say unto him we are
able
and he saith unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be
baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with but to sit on my
right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given
to them for whom it is prepared of my father
and when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation
against the two brethren
but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the
princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are
great exercise authority upon them
but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great
among you let him be your minister  and whosoever will be chief
among you let him be your servant  even as the son of man came
not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a
ransom for many
and as they departed from jericho a great multitude followed
him
and behold two blind men sitting by the way side when they
heard that jesus passed by cried out saying have mercy on us o
lord thou son of david
and the multitude rebuked them because they should hold their
peace but they cried the more saying have mercy on us o lord thou
son of david
and jesus stood still and called them and said what will ye
that i shall do unto you   they say unto him lord that our
eyes may be opened
so jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and
immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him
and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to
bethphage unto the mount of olives then sent jesus two disciples
saying unto them go into the village over against you and
straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose
them and bring them unto me
and if any man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hath
need of them and straightway he will send them
all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
the prophet saying  tell ye the daughter of sion behold thy
king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the
foal of an ass
and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them  and
brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they
set him thereon
and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way
others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way
and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried
saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the
name of the lord hosanna in the highest
and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved
saying who is this   and the multitude said this is jesus the
prophet of nazareth of galilee
and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them
that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the
moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves  and said
unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of
prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves
and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he
healed them
and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things
that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying
hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased  and said
unto him hearest thou what these say and jesus saith unto them yea
have ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast
perfected praise   and he left them and went out of the city
into bethany and he lodged there
now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered
and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found
nothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow
on thee henceforward for ever and presently the fig tree withered
away
and when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying how soon
is the fig tree withered away   jesus answered and said unto
them verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall
not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall
say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the
sea it shall be done
and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye
shall receive
and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the
elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by
what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this
authority   and jesus answered and said unto them i also will
ask you one thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell you
by what authority i do these things
the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men and
they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven
he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him   but if we
shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet
and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell and he said
unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things
but what think ye a certain man had two sons and he came to
the first and said son go work to day in my vineyard
he answered and said i will not but afterward he repented and
went
and he came to the second and said likewise and he answered
and said i go sir and went not
whether of them twain did the will of his father they say unto
him the first jesus saith unto them verily i say unto you that the
publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you
for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye
believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and
ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that ye might believe
him
hear another parable there was a certain householder which
planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepress
in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into
a far country  and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent
his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of
it
and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed
another and stoned another
again he sent other servants more than the first and they did
unto them likewise
but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will
reverence my son
but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves
this is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his
inheritance
and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew
him
when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do
unto those husbandmen   they say unto him he will miserably
destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other
husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons
jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures the
stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the
corner this is the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes
therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from
you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof
and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on
whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder
and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables
they perceived that he spake of them
but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the
multitude because they took him for a prophet
and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and
said  the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which
made a marriage for his son  and sent forth his servants to call
them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come
again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are
bidden behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are
killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage
but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm
another to his merchandise  and the remnant took his servants
and entreated them spitefully and slew them
but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth
his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city
then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they
which were bidden were not worthy
go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find
bid to the marriage
so those servants went out into the highways and gathered
together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding
was furnished with guests
and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man
which had not on a wedding garment  and he saith unto him
friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he
was speechless
then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and
take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth
for many are called but few are chosen
then went the pharisees and took counsel how they might
entangle him in his talk
and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians
saying master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of
god in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not
the person of men
tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to give
tribute unto caesar or not   but jesus perceived their
wickedness and said why tempt ye me ye hypocrites   shew me
the tribute money and they brought unto him a penny
and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription
they say unto him caesars then saith he unto them render
therefore unto caesar the things which are caesars and unto god the
things that are gods
when they had heard these words they marvelled and left him
and went their way
the same day came to him the sadducees which say that there is
no resurrection and asked him  saying master moses said if a
man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and
raise up seed unto his brother
now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he
had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto
his brother  likewise the second also and the third unto the
seventh
and last of all the woman died also
therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
seven  for they all had her
jesus answered and said unto them ye do err not knowing the
scriptures nor the power of god
for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in
marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven
but as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read
that which was spoken unto you by god saying  i am the god of
abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob  god is not the
god of the dead but of the living
and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his
doctrine
but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees
to silence they were gathered together
then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question
tempting him and saying  master which is the great commandment
in the law   jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy
god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind
this is the first and great commandment
and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself
on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them
saying what think ye of christ whose son is he they say unto
him the son of david
he saith unto them how then doth david in spirit call him lord
saying  the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand
till i make thine enemies thy footstool   if david then call him
lord how is he his son   and no man was able to answer him a
word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more
questions
then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples
saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat  all
therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do
not ye after their works for they say and do not
for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay
them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with
one of their fingers
but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make
broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments
and love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in
the synagogues  and greetings in the markets and to be called of
men rabbi rabbi
but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even christ
and all ye are brethren
and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your
father which is in heaven
neither be ye called masters for one is your master even
christ
but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant
and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that
shall humble himself shall be exalted
but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut
up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves
neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour
widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye
shall receive the greater damnation
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass
sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him
twofold more the child of hell than yourselves
woe unto you ye blind guides which say whosoever shall swear
by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of
the temple he is a debtor   ye fools and blind for whether is
greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold
and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever
sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty
ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the
altar that sanctifieth the gift   whoso therefore shall swear by
the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon
and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him
that dwelleth therein
and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of
god and by him that sitteth thereon
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay
tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier
matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have
done and not to leave the other undone
ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye make
clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are
full of extortion and excess
thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup
and platter that the outside of them may be clean also
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like
unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are
within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness
even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within
ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because ye
build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the
righteous  and say if we had been in the days of our fathers
we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
prophets
wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the
children of them which killed the prophets
fill ye up then the measure of your fathers
ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the
damnation of hell   wherefore behold i send unto you prophets
and wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify
and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute
them from city to city  that upon you may come all the righteous
blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous abel unto the
blood of zacharias son of barachias whom ye slew between the temple
and the altar
verily i say unto you all these things shall come upon this
generation
o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and
stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered
thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings and ye would not   behold your house is left unto you
desolate
for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye
shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his
disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple
and jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily i
say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another
that shall not be thrown down
and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto
him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what
shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world
and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive
you
for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall
deceive many
and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not
troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not
yet
for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against
kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes
in divers places
all these are the beginning of sorrows
then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill
you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake
and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
and shall hate one another
and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many
and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax
cold
but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come
when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation
spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso
readeth let him understand  then let them which be in judaea
flee into the mountains  let him which is on the housetop not
come down to take any thing out of his house  neither let him
which is in the field return back to take his clothes
and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give
suck in those days   but pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter neither on the sabbath day  for then shall be great
tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this
time no nor ever shall be
and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh
be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened
then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or
there believe it not
for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and
shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were
possible they shall deceive the very elect
behold i have told you before
wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the
desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it
not
for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even
unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be
for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be
gathered together
immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall
fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken
and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then
shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of
man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory
and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet
and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one
end of heaven to the other
now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet
tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh
so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is
near even at the doors
verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all
these things be fulfilled
heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass
away
but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of
heaven but my father only
but as the days of noe were so shall also the coming of the son
of man be
for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe
entered into the ark  and knew not until the flood came and
took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be
then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the
other left
two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken
and the other left
watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come
but know this that if the goodman of the house had known in
what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not
have suffered his house to be broken up
therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not
the son of man cometh
who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made
ruler over his household to give them meat in due season
blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so
doing
verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his
goods
but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord
delayeth his coming  and shall begin to smite his
fellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunken  the lord
of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and
in an hour that he is not aware of  and shall cut him asunder
and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth
then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins
which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom
and five of them were wise and five were foolish
they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with
them  but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps
while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept
and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom
cometh go ye out to meet him
then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps
and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our
lamps are gone out
but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough
for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for
yourselves
and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that
were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut
afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open
to us
but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not
watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour
wherein the son of man cometh
for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his
goods
and unto one he gave five talents to another two and to
another one to every man according to his several ability and
straightway took his journey
then he that had received the five talents went and traded with
the same and made them other five talents
and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two
but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and
hid his lords money
after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and
reckoneth with them
and so he that had received five talents came and brought other
five talents saying lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents
behold i have gained beside them five talents more
his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful
servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee
ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord
he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou
deliveredst unto me two talents behold i have gained two other
talents beside them
his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant
thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over
many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord
then he which had received the one talent came and said lord i
knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sown
and gathering where thou hast not strawed  and i was afraid and
went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is
thine
his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slothful
servant thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not and gather where
i have not strawed  thou oughtest therefore to have put my money
to the exchangers and then at my coming i should have received mine
own with usury
take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which
hath ten talents
for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have
abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath
and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy
angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory
and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate
them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the
goats  and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the
goats on the left
then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye
blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world  for i was an hungred and ye gave me
meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye
took me in  naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited
me i was in prison and ye came unto me
then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we
thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink
when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed
thee   or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto
thee   and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say
unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these
my brethren ye have done it unto me
then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from
me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his
angels  for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat i was
thirsty and ye gave me no drink  i was a stranger and ye took
me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye
visited me not
then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee
an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in
prison and did not minister unto thee   then shall he answer
them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one
of the least of these ye did it not to me
and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the
righteous into life eternal
and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these sayings
he said unto his disciples  ye know that after two days is the
feast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified
then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and
the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest who was
called caiaphas  and consulted that they might take jesus by
subtilty and kill him
but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar
among the people
now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper
there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat
but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to
what purpose is this waste   for this ointment might have been
sold for much and given to the poor
when jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the
woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me
for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always
for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it
for my burial
verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done
be told for a memorial of her
then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the
chief priests  and said unto them what will ye give me and i
will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for thirty
pieces of silver
and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him
now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples
came to jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for
thee to eat the passover   and he said go into the city to such
a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i will
keep the passover at thy house with my disciples
and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they made
ready the passover
now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve
and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one of
you shall betray me
and they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them
to say unto him lord is it i   and he answered and said he
that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me
the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that
man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man
if he had not been born
then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it
i  he said unto him thou hast said
and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and
brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is
my body
and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them
saying drink ye all of it  for this is my blood of the new
testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins
but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of
the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers
kingdom
and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of
olives
then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of
me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the
sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad
but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee
peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be
offended because of thee yet will i never be offended
jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night
before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice
peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i
not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples
then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and
saith unto the disciples sit ye here while i go and pray yonder
and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and
began to be sorrowful and very heavy
then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even
unto death tarry ye here and watch with me
and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed
saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me
nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt
and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and
saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour
watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed
is willing but the flesh is weak
he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my
father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy
will be done
and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were
heavy
and he left them and went away again and prayed the third
time saying the same words
then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on
now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of
man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray
me
and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and
with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief
priests and elders of the people
now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i
shall kiss that same is he hold him fast
and forthwith he came to jesus and said hail master and
kissed him
and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come then
came they and laid hands on jesus and took him
and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out his
hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priests
and smote off his ear
then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place
for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword
thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall
presently give me more than twelve legions of angels   but how
then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be
in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes are ye come out as
against a thief with swords and staves for to take me i sat daily
with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me
but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might
be fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled
and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphas
the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled
but peter followed him afar off unto the high priests palace
and went in and sat with the servants to see the end
now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought
false witness against jesus to put him to death  but found
none yea though many false witnesses came yet found they none at
the last came two false witnesses  and said this fellow said i
am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days
and the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thou
nothing what is it which these witness against thee   but jesus
held his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him i
adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the
christ the son of god
jesus saith unto him thou hast said nevertheless i say unto
you hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand
of power and coming in the clouds of heaven
then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spoken
blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have
heard his blasphemy
what think ye they answered and said he is guilty of death
then did they spit in his face and buffeted him and others
smote him with the palms of their hands  saying prophesy unto
us thou christ who is he that smote thee   now peter sat
without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also
wast with jesus of galilee
but he denied before them all saying i know not what thou
sayest
and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him
and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with jesus of
nazareth
and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man
and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to
peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech bewrayeth
thee
then began he to curse and to swear saying i know not the man
and immediately the cock crew
and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto him
before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and
wept bitterly
when the morning was come all the chief priests and elders of
the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death  and
when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to
pontius pilate the governor
then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was
condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of
silver to the chief priests and elders  saying i have sinned in
that i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that
to us see thou to that
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and
departed and went and hanged himself
and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not
lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of
blood
and they took counsel and bought with them the potters field
to bury strangers in
wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this
day
then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet
saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him
that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value
and gave them for the potters field as the lord appointed me
and jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him
saying art thou the king of the jews and jesus said unto him thou
sayest
and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders he
answered nothing
then said pilate unto him hearest thou not how many things they
witness against thee   and he answered him to never a word
insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly
now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the
people a prisoner whom they would
and they had then a notable prisoner called barabbas
therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto
them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus which
is called christ   for he knew that for envy they had delivered
him
when he was set down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto
him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for i have
suffered many things this day in a dream because of him
but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that
they should ask barabbas and destroy jesus
the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twain
will ye that i release unto you they said barabbas
pilate saith unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is
called christ they all say unto him let him be crucified
and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they
cried out the more saying let him be crucified
when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a
tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the
multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see
ye to it
then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and
on our children
then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scourged
jesus he delivered him to be crucified
then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common
hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers
and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe
and when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it upon
his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before
him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews   and they
spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head
and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from
him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him
and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name
him they compelled to bear his cross
and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to
say a place of a skull  they gave him vinegar to drink mingled
with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink
and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they
parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots
and sitting down they watched him there  and set up over
his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews
then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right
hand and another on the left
and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads
and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three
days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the
cross
likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes
and elders said  he saved others himself he cannot save if he
be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we
will believe him
he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him
for he said i am the son of god
the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same
in his teeth
now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land
unto the ninth hour
and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying
eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast
thou forsaken me   some of them that stood there when they
heard that said this man calleth for elias
and straightway one of them ran and took a spunge and filled
it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink
the rest said let be let us see whether elias will come to
save him
jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the
ghost
and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent
and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept
arose  and came out of the graves after his resurrection and
went into the holy city and appeared unto many
now when the centurion and they that were with him watching
jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they
feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god
and many women were there beholding afar off which followed
jesus from galilee ministering unto him  among which was mary
magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of
zebedees children
when the even was come there came a rich man of arimathaea
named joseph who also himself was jesus disciple  he went to
pilate and begged the body of jesus then pilate commanded the body
to be delivered
and when joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean
linen cloth  and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn
out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
sepulchre and departed
and there was mary magdalene and the other mary sitting over
against the sepulchre
now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the
chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate  saying
sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive
after three days i will rise again
command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the
third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and
say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error
shall be worse than the first
pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as
sure as ye can
so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone
and setting a watch
in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first
day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the
sepulchre
and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the
lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from
the door and sat upon it
his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as
snow  and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as
dead men
and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for
i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified
he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place
where the lord lay
and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the
dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye
see him lo i have told you
and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great
joy and did run to bring his disciples word
and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them
saying all hail and they came and held him by the feet and
worshipped him
then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren
that they go into galilee and there shall they see me
now when they were going behold some of the watch came into
the city and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were
done
and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken
counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers  saying say
ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept
and if this come to the governors ears we will persuade him
and secure you
so they took the money and did as they were taught and this
saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day
then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a
mountain where jesus had appointed them
and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted
and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given
unto me in heaven and in earth
go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the
name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you
and lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world amen
the gospel according to saint mark
the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god
as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger before
thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of
the lord make his paths straight
john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins
and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they of
jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan
confessing their sins
and john was clothed with camels hair and with a girdle of a
skin about his loins and he did eat locusts and wild honey  and
preached saying there cometh one mightier than i after me the
latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose
i indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you
with the holy ghost
and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth
of galilee and was baptized of john in jordan
and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens
opened and the spirit like a dove descending upon him  and there
came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i
am well pleased
and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness
and he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan
and was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto him
now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee
preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god  and saying the time
is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and
believe the gospel
now as he walked by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew
his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers
and jesus said unto them come ye after me and i will make you
to become fishers of men
and straightway they forsook their nets and followed him
and when he had gone a little farther thence he saw james the
son of zebedee and john his brother who also were in the ship
mending their nets
and straightway he called them and they left their father
zebedee in the ship with the hired servants and went after him
and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day
he entered into the synagogue and taught
and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as
one that had authority and not as the scribes
and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit
and he cried out  saying let us alone what have we to do with
thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee
who thou art the holy one of god
and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of
him
and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud
voice he came out of him
and they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among
themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this for
with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do
obey him
and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region
round about galilee
and forthwith when they were come out of the synagogue they
entered into the house of simon and andrew with james and john
but simons wifes mother lay sick of a fever and anon they tell
him of her
and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and
immediately the fever left her and she ministered unto them
and at even when the sun did set they brought unto him all that
were diseased and them that were possessed with devils
and all the city was gathered together at the door
and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases and cast
out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they
knew him
and in the morning rising up a great while before day he went
out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed
and simon and they that were with him followed after him
and when they had found him they said unto him all men seek for
thee
and he said unto them let us go into the next towns that i may
preach there also for therefore came i forth
and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee and
cast out devils
and there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down
to him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
and jesus moved with compassion put forth his hand and touched
him and saith unto him i will be thou clean
and as soon as he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed
from him and he was cleansed
and he straitly charged him and forthwith sent him away
and saith unto him see thou say nothing to any man but go thy way
shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing those things
which moses commanded for a testimony unto them
but he went out and began to publish it much and to blaze
abroad the matter insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into
the city but was without in desert places and they came to him from
every quarter
and again he entered into capernaum after some days and it was
noised that he was in the house
and straightway many were gathered together insomuch that there
was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he
preached the word unto them
and they come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy which was
borne of four
and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they
uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they
let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay
when jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsy
son thy sins be forgiven thee
but there was certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning
in their hearts  why doth this man thus speak blasphemies who can
forgive sins but god only   and immediately when jesus perceived
in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves he said unto
them why reason ye these things in your hearts   whether is it
easier to say to the sick of the palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or
to say arise and take up thy bed and walk   but that ye may
know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins he
saith to the sick of the palsy  i say unto thee arise and take
up thy bed and go thy way into thine house
and immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth before
them all insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified god
saying we never saw it on this fashion
and he went forth again by the sea side and all the multitude
resorted unto him and he taught them
and as he passed by he saw levi the son of alphaeus sitting at
the receipt of custom and said unto him follow me and he arose and
followed him
and it came to pass that as jesus sat at meat in his house
many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his
disciples for there were many and they followed him
and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and
sinners they said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth and
drinketh with publicans and sinners   when jesus heard it he
saith unto them they that are whole have no need of the physician
but they that are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners
to repentance
and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast and
they come and say unto him why do the disciples of john and of the
pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not   and jesus said unto
them can the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom
is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they
cannot fast
but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them and then shall they fast in those days
no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment else
the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old and the rent
is made worse
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine
doth burst the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles will
be marred but new wine must be put into new bottles
and it came to pass that he went through the corn fields on the
sabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears
of corn
and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the
sabbath day that which is not lawful   and he said unto them
have ye never read what david did when he had need and was an
hungred he and they that were with him   how he went into the
house of god in the days of abiathar the high priest and did eat the
shewbread which is not lawful to eat but for the priests and gave
also to them which were with him   and he said unto them the
sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath  therefore
the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
and he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there
which had a withered hand
and they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath
day that they might accuse him
and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand stand
forth
and he saith unto them is it lawful to do good on the sabbath
days or to do evil to save life or to kill but they held their
peace
and when he had looked round about on them with anger being
grieved for the hardness of their hearts he saith unto the man
stretch forth thine hand and he stretched it out and his hand was
restored whole as the other
and the pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel with
the herodians against him how they might destroy him
but jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea and a
great multitude from galilee followed him and from judaea  and
from jerusalem and from idumaea and from beyond jordan and they
about tyre and sidon a great multitude when they had heard what
great things he did came unto him
and he spake to his disciples that a small ship should wait on
him because of the multitude lest they should throng him
for he had healed many insomuch that they pressed upon him for
to touch him as many as had plagues
and unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and
cried saying thou art the son of god
and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known
and he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom he
would and they came unto him
and he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he
might send them forth to preach  and to have power to heal
sicknesses and to cast out devils  and simon he surnamed peter
and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and
he surnamed them boanerges which is the sons of thunder  and
andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and
james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the canaanite
and judas iscariot which also betrayed him and they went into
an house
and the multitude cometh together again so that they could not
so much as eat bread
and when his friends heard of it they went out to lay hold on
him for they said he is beside himself
and the scribes which came down from jerusalem said he hath
beelzebub and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils
and he called them unto him and said unto them in parables how
can satan cast out satan   and if a kingdom be divided against
itself that kingdom cannot stand
and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot
stand
and if satan rise up against himself and be divided he cannot
stand but hath an end
no man can enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods
except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his
house
verily i say unto you all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons
of men and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme
but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never
forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation
because they said he hath an unclean spirit
there came then his brethren and his mother and standing
without sent unto him calling him
and the multitude sat about him and they said unto him behold
thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee
and he answered them saying who is my mother or my brethren
and he looked round about on them which sat about him and said
behold my mother and my brethren   for whosoever shall do the
will of god the same is my brother and my sister and mother
and he began again to teach by the sea side and there was
gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship
and sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the
land
and he taught them many things by parables and said unto them in
his doctrine  hearken behold there went out a sower to sow
and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the way side and the
fowls of the air came and devoured it up
and some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and
immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth  but
when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it
withered away
and some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it
and it yielded no fruit
and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up
and increased and brought forth some thirty and some sixty and
some an hundred
and he said unto them he that hath ears to hear let him hear
and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve
asked of him the parable
and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery
of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these
things are done in parables  that seeing they may see and not
perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any
time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them
and he said unto them know ye not this parable and how then
will ye know all parables   the sower soweth the word
and these are they by the way side where the word is sown but
when they have heard satan cometh immediately and taketh away the
word that was sown in their hearts
and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who
when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness
and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time
afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake
immediately they are offended
and these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear the
word  and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of
riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and
it becometh unfruitful
and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear
the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some
sixty and some an hundred
and he said unto them is a candle brought to be put under a
bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick   for
there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested neither was any
thing kept secret but that it should come abroad
if any man have ears to hear let him hear
and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measure
ye mete it shall be measured to you and unto you that hear shall
more be given
for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not
from him shall be taken even that which he hath
and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast
seed into the ground  and should sleep and rise night and day
and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how
for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade
then the ear after that the full corn in the ear
but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in
the sickle because the harvest is come
and he said whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god or with
what comparison shall we compare it   it is like a grain of
mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all
the seeds that be in the earth  but when it is sown it groweth
up and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out great
branches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of
it
and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they
were able to hear it
but without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were
alone he expounded all things to his disciples
and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let
us pass over unto the other side
and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as
he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships
and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into
the ship so that it was now full
and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow
and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we
perish   and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the
sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm
and he said unto them why are ye so fearful how is it that ye
have no faith   and they feared exceedingly and said one to
another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea
obey him   and they came over unto the other side of the sea into
the country of the gadarenes
and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him
out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit  who had his
dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with
chains  because that he had been often bound with fetters and
chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the
fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him
and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the
tombs crying and cutting himself with stones
but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him  and
cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus
thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou torment
me not
for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit
and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my
name is legion for we are many
and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of
the country
now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine
feeding
and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine
that we may enter into them
and forthwith jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went
out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a
steep place into the sea they were about two thousand and were
choked in the sea
and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in
the country and they went out to see what it was that was done
and they come to jesus and see him that was possessed with the
devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right
mind and they were afraid
and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine
and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts
and when he was come into the ship he that had been possessed
with the devil prayed him that he might be with him
howbeit jesus suffered him not but saith unto him go home to
thy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for
thee and hath had compassion on thee
and he departed and began to publish in decapolis how great
things jesus had done for him and all men did marvel
and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side
much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea
and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue
jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet  and
besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of
death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be
healed and she shall live
and jesus went with him and much people followed him and
thronged him
and a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years
and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent
all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse
when she had heard of jesus came in the press behind and
touched his garment
for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole
and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she
felt in her body that she was healed of that plague
and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone
out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my
clothes   and his disciples said unto him thou seest the
multitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched me   and
he looked round about to see her that had done this thing
but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in
her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth
and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole
go in peace and be whole of thy plague
while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogues
house certain which said thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the
master any further   as soon as jesus heard the word that was
spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid only
believe
and he suffered no man to follow him save peter and james and
john the brother of james
and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and
seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly
and when he was come in he saith unto them why make ye this
ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth
and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all out
he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were
with him and entereth in where the damsel was lying
and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha
cumi which is being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise
and straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was of the
age of twelve years and they were astonished with a great
astonishment
and he charged them straitly that no man should know it and
commanded that something should be given her to eat
and he went out from thence and came into his own country and
his disciples follow him
and when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the
synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence
hath this man these things and what wisdom is this which is given
unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands
is not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james and
joses and of juda and simon and are not his sisters here with us
and they were offended at him
but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour but in
his own country and among his own kin and in his own house
and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands
upon a few sick folk and healed them
and he marvelled because of their unbelief and he went round
about the villages teaching
and he called unto him the twelve and began to send them forth by
two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits  and
commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey save a
staff only no scrip no bread no money in their purse  but be
shod with sandals and not put on two coats
and he said unto them in what place soever ye enter into an
house there abide till ye depart from that place
and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart
thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against
them
verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for sodom and
gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city
and they went out and preached that men should repent
and they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that
were sick and healed them
and king herod heard of him for his name was spread abroad
and he said that john the baptist was risen from the dead and
therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him
others said that it is elias and others said that it is a
prophet or as one of the prophets
but when herod heard thereof he said it is john whom i
beheaded he is risen from the dead
for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and
bound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife for
he had married her
for john had said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to have
thy brothers wife
therefore herodias had a quarrel against him and would have
killed him but she could not  for herod feared john knowing
that he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when he
heard him he did many things and heard him gladly
and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthday
made a supper to his lords high captains and chief estates of
galilee  and when the daughter of the said herodias came in and
danced and pleased herod and them that sat with him the king said
unto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give it
thee
and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i will
give it thee unto the half of my kingdom
and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i ask
and she said the head of john the baptist
and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked
saying i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of
john the baptist
and the king was exceeding sorry yet for his oaths sake and
for their sakes which sat with him he would not reject her
and immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his
head to be brought and he went and beheaded him in the prison
and brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and the
damsel gave it to her mother
and when his disciples heard of it they came and took up his
corpse and laid it in a tomb
and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus and
told him all things both what they had done and what they had
taught
and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert
place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and
they had no leisure so much as to eat
and they departed into a desert place by ship privately
and the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran
afoot thither out of all cities and outwent them and came together
unto him
and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with
compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a
shepherd and he began to teach them many things
and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him
and said this is a desert place and now the time is far passed
send them away that they may go into the country round about and
into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to
eat
he answered and said unto them give ye them to eat and they say
unto him shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and
give them to eat   he saith unto them how many loaves have ye
go and see and when they knew they say five and two fishes
and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the
green grass
and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties
and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he
looked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and gave them
to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he
among them all
and they did all eat and were filled
and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the
fishes
and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men
and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the
ship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida while he sent
away the people
and when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to
pray
and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and
he alone on the land
and he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto
them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them
walking upon the sea and would have passed by them
but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had
been a spirit and cried out  for they all saw him and were
troubled and immediately he talked with them and saith unto them be
of good cheer it is i be not afraid
and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and
they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered
for they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their
heart was hardened
and when they had passed over they came into the land of
gennesaret and drew to the shore
and when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew
him  and ran through that whole region round about and began to
carry about in beds those that were sick where they heard he was
and whithersoever he entered into villages or cities or
country they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they
might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as
touched him were made whole
then came together unto him the pharisees and certain of the
scribes which came from jerusalem
and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled
that is to say with unwashen hands they found fault
for the pharisees and all the jews except they wash their hands
oft eat not holding the tradition of the elders
and when they come from the market except they wash they eat
not
and many other things there be which they have received to hold as
the washing of cups and pots brasen vessels and of tables
then the pharisees and scribes asked him why walk not thy
disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with
unwashen hands   he answered and said unto them well hath esaias
prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoureth
me with their lips but their heart is far from me
howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men
for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of
men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things
ye do
and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god
that ye may keep your own tradition
for moses said honour thy father and thy mother and whoso
curseth father or mother let him die the death  but ye say if a
man shall say to his father or mother it is corban that is to say a
gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be free
and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
mother  making the word of god of none effect through your
tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things do ye
and when he had called all the people unto him he said unto
them hearken unto me every one of you and understand  there is
nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but
the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man
if any man have ears to hear let him hear
and when he was entered into the house from the people his
disciples asked him concerning the parable
and he saith unto them are ye so without understanding also do
ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the
man it cannot defile him  because it entereth not into his
heart but into the belly and goeth out into the draught purging all
meats   and he said that which cometh out of the man that
defileth the man
for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts
adulteries fornications murders  thefts covetousness
wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride
foolishness  all these evil things come from within and defile
the man
and from thence he arose and went into the borders of tyre and
sidon and entered into an house and would have no man know it but
he could not be hid
for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit
heard of him and came and fell at his feet  the woman was a
greek a syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he would
cast forth the devil out of her daughter
but jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it
is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it unto the
dogs
and she answered and said unto him yes lord yet the dogs under
the table eat of the childrens crumbs
and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil is
gone out of thy daughter
and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out
and her daughter laid upon the bed
and again departing from the coasts of tyre and sidon he came
unto the sea of galilee through the midst of the coasts of decapolis
and they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment
in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him
and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers
into his ears and he spit and touched his tongue  and looking
up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him ephphatha that is be
opened
and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his
tongue was loosed and he spake plain
and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he
charged them so much the more a great deal they published it
and were beyond measure astonished saying he hath done all things
well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak
in those days the multitude being very great and having nothing
to eat jesus called his disciples unto him and saith unto them
i have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me
three days and have nothing to eat  and if i send them away
fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers of
them came from far
and his disciples answered him from whence can a man satisfy
these men with bread here in the wilderness   and he asked them
how many loaves have ye and they said seven
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he took
the seven loaves and gave thanks and brake and gave to his
disciples to set before them and they did set them before the people
and they had a few small fishes and he blessed and commanded to
set them also before them
so they did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken
meat that was left seven baskets
and they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them
away
and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and
came into the parts of dalmanutha
and the pharisees came forth and began to question with him
seeking of him a sign from heaven tempting him
and he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith why doth this
generation seek after a sign verily i say unto you there shall no
sign be given unto this generation
and he left them and entering into the ship again departed to
the other side
now the disciples had forgotten to take bread neither had they
in the ship with them more than one loaf
and he charged them saying take heed beware of the leaven of
the pharisees and of the leaven of herod
and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have
no bread
and when jesus knew it he saith unto them why reason ye
because ye have no bread perceive ye not yet neither understand
have ye your heart yet hardened   having eyes see ye not and
having ears hear ye not and do ye not remember   when i brake
the five loaves among five thousand how many baskets full of
fragments took ye up they say unto him twelve
and when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full of
fragments took ye up and they said seven
and he said unto them how is it that ye do not understand
and he cometh to bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and
besought him to touch him
and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the
town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he
asked him if he saw ought
and he looked up and said i see men as trees walking
after that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him
look up and he was restored and saw every man clearly
and he sent him away to his house saying neither go into the
town nor tell it to any in the town
and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesarea
philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them
whom do men say that i am   and they answered john the baptist
but some say elias and others one of the prophets
and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and peter
answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ
and he charged them that they should tell no man of him
and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many
things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and
scribes and be killed and after three days rise again
and he spake that saying openly and peter took him and began to
rebuke him
but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he
rebuked peter saying get thee behind me satan for thou savourest
not the things that be of god but the things that be of men
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples
also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny
himself and take up his cross and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever
shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save
it
for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world
and lose his own soul   or what shall a man give in exchange for
his soul   whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my
words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the
son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with
the holy angels
and he said unto them verily i say unto you that there be some
of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they
have seen the kingdom of god come with power
and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and
john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves
and he was transfigured before them
and his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no
fuller on earth can white them
and there appeared unto them elias with moses and they were
talking with jesus
and peter answered and said to jesus master it is good for us to
be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for
moses and one for elias
for he wist not what to say for they were sore afraid
and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out
of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him
and suddenly when they had looked round about they saw no man
any more save jesus only with themselves
and as they came down from the mountain he charged them that they
should tell no man what things they had seen till the son of man were
risen from the dead
and they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with
another what the rising from the dead should mean
and they asked him saying why say the scribes that elias must
first come   and he answered and told them elias verily cometh
first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the son of
man that he must suffer many things and be set at nought
but i say unto you that elias is indeed come and they have done
unto him whatsoever they listed as it is written of him
and when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude about
them and the scribes questioning with them
and straightway all the people when they beheld him were
greatly amazed and running to him saluted him
and he asked the scribes what question ye with them   and
one of the multitude answered and said master i have brought unto
thee my son which hath a dumb spirit  and wheresoever he taketh
him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and
pineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him
out and they could not
he answereth him and saith o faithless generation how long
shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me
and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway
the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming
and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto
him  and he said of a child
and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters
to destroy him but if thou canst do any thing have compassion on us
and help us
jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are
possible to him that believeth
and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with
tears lord i believe help thou mine unbelief
when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked
the foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charge
thee come out of him and enter no more into him
and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and
he was as one dead insomuch that many said he is dead
but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose
and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him
privately why could not we cast him out   and he said unto them
this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting
and they departed thence and passed through galilee and he
would not that any man should know it
for he taught his disciples and said unto them the son of man
is delivered into the hands of men and they shall kill him and after
that he is killed he shall rise the third day
but they understood not that saying and were afraid to ask him
and he came to capernaum and being in the house he asked them
what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way   but
they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among
themselves who should be the greatest
and he sat down and called the twelve and saith unto them if
any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant
of all
and he took a child and set him in the midst of them and when
he had taken him in his arms he said unto them  whosoever shall
receive one of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoever
shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me
and john answered him saying master we saw one casting out
devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad him
because he followeth not us
but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall
do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me
for he that is not against us is on our part
for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name
because ye belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not lose
his reward
and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe
in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
neck and he were cast into the sea
and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to
enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into
the fire that never shall be quenched  where their worm dieth
not and the fire is not quenched
and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to
enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell into
the fire that never shall be quenched  where their worm dieth
not and the fire is not quenched
and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee
to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes to
be cast into hell fire  where their worm dieth not and the fire
is not quenched
for every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice
shall be salted with salt
salt is good but if the salt have lost his saltness wherewith
will ye season it have salt in yourselves and have peace one with
another
and he arose from thence and cometh into the coasts of judaea by
the farther side of jordan and the people resort unto him again and
as he was wont he taught them again
and the pharisees came to him and asked him is it lawful for a
man to put away his wife tempting him
and he answered and said unto them what did moses command you
and they said moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and
to put her away
and jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your
heart he wrote you this precept
but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and
female
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and
cleave to his wife  and they twain shall be one flesh so then
they are no more twain but one flesh
what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder
and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same
matter
and he saith unto them whosoever shall put away his wife and
marry another committeth adultery against her
and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to
another she committeth adultery
and they brought young children to him that he should touch
them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them
but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto
them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not
for of such is the kingdom of god
verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
of god as a little child he shall not enter therein
and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and
blessed them
and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running
and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i
may inherit eternal life   and jesus said unto him why callest
thou me good there is none good but one that is god
thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not
kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy
father and mother   and he answered and said unto him master
all these have i observed from my youth
then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing
thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the
poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the
cross and follow me
and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had
great possessions
and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how
hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus
answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for
them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god   it
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
and they were astonished out of measure saying among
themselves who then can be saved   and jesus looking upon them
saith with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all
things are possible
then peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have
followed thee
and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no
man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or
mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels
but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses
and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with
persecutions and in the world to come eternal life
but many that are first shall be last and the last first
and they were in the way going up to jerusalem and jesus went
before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were
afraid
and he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things
should happen unto him  saying behold we go up to jerusalem
and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto
the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver
him to the gentiles  and they shall mock him and shall scourge
him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he
shall rise again
and james and john the sons of zebedee come unto him saying
master we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall
desire
and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you
they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on thy
right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory
but jesus said unto them ye know not what ye ask can ye drink
of the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i am
baptized with   and they said unto him we can and jesus said
unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and with
the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized  but
to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but
it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared
and when the ten heard it they began to be much displeased with
james and john
but jesus called them to him and saith unto them ye know that
they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship
over them and their great ones exercise authority upon them
but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great
among you shall be your minister  and whosoever of you will be
the chiefest shall be servant of all
for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to
minister and to give his life a ransom for many
and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his
disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of
timaeus sat by the highway side begging
and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry
out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me
and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried
the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me
and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they
call the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he
calleth thee
and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus
and jesus answered and said unto him what wilt thou that i
should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i might
receive my sight
and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made thee
whole
and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way
and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto bethphage and bethany
at the mount of olives he sendeth forth two of his disciples
and saith unto them go your way into the village over against you
and as soon as ye be entered into it ye shall find a colt tied
whereon never man sat loose him and bring him
and if any man say unto you why do ye this say ye that the lord
hath need of him and straightway he will send him hither
and they went their way and found the colt tied by the door
without in a place where two ways met and they loose him
and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do ye
loosing the colt   and they said unto them even as jesus had
commanded and they let them go
and they brought the colt to jesus and cast their garments on
him and he sat upon him
and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down
branches off the trees and strawed them in the way
and they that went before and they that followed cried saying
hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of
the lord hosanna in the highest
and jesus entered into jerusalem and into the temple and when
he had looked round about upon all things and now the eventide was
come he went out unto bethany with the twelve
and on the morrow when they were come from bethany he was
hungry  and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came
if haply he might find any thing thereon and when he came to it he
found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet
and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee
hereafter for ever and his disciples heard it
and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and
began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and
overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that
sold doves  and would not suffer that any man should carry any
vessel through the temple
and he taught saying unto them is it not written my house
shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but ye have made
it a den of thieves
and the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they
might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was
astonished at his doctrine
and when even was come he went out of the city
and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree
dried up from the roots
and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master behold
the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away
and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god
for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this
mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall
not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he
saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith
therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye
pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them
and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have ought against
any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your
trespasses
but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in
heaven forgive your trespasses
and they come again to jerusalem and as he was walking in the
temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the
elders  and say unto him by what authority doest thou these
things and who gave thee this authority to do these things
and jesus answered and said unto them i will also ask of you one
question and answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do
these things
the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men answer me
and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from
heaven he will say why then did ye not believe him   but if we
shall say of men they feared the people for all men counted john
that he was a prophet indeed
and they answered and said unto jesus we cannot tell and jesus
answering saith unto them neither do i tell you by what authority i
do these things
and he began to speak unto them by parables a certain man
planted a vineyard and set an hedge about it and digged a place for
the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went
into a far country
and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he
might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard
and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty
and again he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast
stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully
handled
and again he sent another and him they killed and many others
beating some and killing some
having yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him also
last unto them saying they will reverence my son
but those husbandmen said among themselves this is the heir
come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours
and they took him and killed him and cast him out of the
vineyard
what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do he will come
and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others
and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the
builders rejected is become the head of the corner  this was the
lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes   and they sought
to lay hold on him but feared the people for they knew that he had
spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their
way
and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the
herodians to catch him in his words
and when they were come they say unto him master we know that
thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the
person of men but teachest the way of god in truth is it lawful to
give tribute to caesar or not   shall we give or shall we not
give but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why tempt ye
me bring me a penny that i may see it
and they brought it and he saith unto them whose is this image
and superscription and they said unto him caesars
and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the things
that are caesars and to god the things that are gods and they
marvelled at him
then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no
resurrection and they asked him saying  master moses wrote
unto us if a mans brother die and leave his wife behind him and
leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up
seed unto his brother
now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and
dying left no seed
and the second took her and died neither left he any seed and
the third likewise
and the seven had her and left no seed last of all the woman
died also
in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wife
shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife
and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore err
because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god
for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are
given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven
and as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read in
the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am
the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob
he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye therefore
do greatly err
and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning
together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him
which is the first commandment of all   and jesus answered him
the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god
is one lord  and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy
heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy
strength this is the first commandment
and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself there is none other commandment greater than
these
and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the
truth for there is one god and there is none other but he  and
to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and
with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his
neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and
sacrifices
and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto
him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that
durst ask him any question
and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple how
say the scribes that christ is the son of david   for david
himself said by the holy ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou on
my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool
david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence is he then
his son and the common people heard him gladly
and he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribes
which love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the
marketplaces  and the chief seats in the synagogues and the
uppermost rooms at feasts  which devour widows houses and for
a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation
and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the
people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in
much
and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites
which make a farthing
and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them
verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than
all they which have cast into the treasury  for all they did
cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that
she had even all her living
and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto
him master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here
and jesus answering said unto him seest thou these great
buildings  there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall
not be thrown down
and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple
peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately  tell us
when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these
things shall be fulfilled   and jesus answering them began to
say take heed lest any man deceive you  for many shall come in
my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars be ye not
troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet
for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against
kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and there
shall be famines and troubles these are the beginnings of sorrows
but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to
councils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be
brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against
them
and the gospel must first be published among all nations
but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no
thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate but
whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is
not ye that speak but the holy ghost
now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the
father the son and children shall rise up against their parents and
shall cause them to be put to death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that
shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved
but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of
by daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that
readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the
mountains  and let him that is on the housetop not go down into
the house neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house
and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take
up his garment
but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck
in those days   and pray ye that your flight be not in the
winter
for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the
beginning of the creation which god created unto this time neither
shall be
and except that the lord had shortened those days no flesh
should be saved but for the elects sake whom he hath chosen he
hath shortened the days
and then if any man shall say to you lo here is christ or
lo he is there believe him not  for false christs and false
prophets shall rise and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce if
it were possible even the elect
but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all things
but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be
darkened and the moon shall not give her light  and the stars
of heaven shall fall and the powers that are in heaven shall be
shaken
and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with
great power and glory
and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his
elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the
uttermost part of heaven
now learn a parable of the fig tree when her branch is yet
tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is near
so ye in like manner when ye shall see these things come to pass
know that it is nigh even at the doors
verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till
all these things be done
heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass
away
but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels
which are in heaven neither the son but the father
take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is
for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left
his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his
work and commanded the porter to watch
watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house
cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the
morning  lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping
and what i say unto you i say unto all watch
after two days was the feast of the passover and of unleavened
bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might
take him by craft and put him to death
but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar of
the people
and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat
at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of
spikenard very precious and she brake the box and poured it on his
head
and there were some that had indignation within themselves and
said why was this waste of the ointment made   for it might have
been sold for more than three hundred pence and have been given to
the poor and they murmured against her
and jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hath
wrought a good work on me
for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever ye will ye
may do them good but me ye have not always
she hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my
body to the burying
verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached
throughout the whole world this also that she hath done shall be
spoken of for a memorial of her
and judas iscariot one of the twelve went unto the chief
priests to betray him unto them
and when they heard it they were glad and promised to give him
money and he sought how he might conveniently betray him
and the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the
passover his disciples said unto him where wilt thou that we go and
prepare that thou mayest eat the passover   and he sendeth forth
two of his disciples and saith unto them go ye into the city and
there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him
and wheresoever he shall go in say ye to the goodman of the
house the master saith where is the guestchamber where i shall eat
the passover with my disciples   and he will shew you a large
upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us
and his disciples went forth and came into the city and found
as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover
and in the evening he cometh with the twelve
and as they sat and did eat jesus said verily i say unto you
one of you which eateth with me shall betray me
and they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one
is it i and another said is it i   and he answered and said
unto them it is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish
the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to
that man by whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man
if he had never been born
and as they did eat jesus took bread and blessed and brake
it and gave to them and said take eat this is my body
and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to
them and they all drank of it
and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament
which is shed for many
verily i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the
vine until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god
and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of
olives
and jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended because of
me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the
sheep shall be scattered
but after that i am risen i will go before you into galilee
but peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet
will not i
and jesus saith unto him verily i say unto thee that this day
even in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me
thrice
but he spake the more vehemently if i should die with thee i
will not deny thee in any wise likewise also said they all
and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and he
saith to his disciples sit ye here while i shall pray
and he taketh with him peter and james and john and began to be
sore amazed and to be very heavy  and saith unto them my soul
is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch
and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed
that if it were possible the hour might pass from him
and he said abba father all things are possible unto thee
take away this cup from me nevertheless not what i will but what
thou wilt
and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter
simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour   watch
ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation the spirit truly is ready
but the flesh is weak
and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words
and when he returned he found them asleep again for their
eyes were heavy neither wist they what to answer him
and he cometh the third time and saith unto them sleep on now
and take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of
man is betrayed into the hands of sinners
rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand
and immediately while he yet spake cometh judas one of the
twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from
the chief priests and the scribes and the elders
and he that betrayed him had given them a token saying
whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he take him and lead him away
safely
and as soon as he was come he goeth straightway to him and
saith master master and kissed him
and they laid their hands on him and took him
and one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant
of the high priest and cut off his ear
and jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out as
against a thief with swords and with staves to take me   i was
daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but the
scriptures must be fulfilled
and they all forsook him and fled
and there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth
cast about his naked body and the young men laid hold on him
and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked
and they led jesus away to the high priest and with him were
assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes
and peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the
high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the
fire
and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness
against jesus to put him to death and found none
for many bare false witness against him but their witness
agreed not together
and there arose certain and bare false witness against him
saying  we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is
made with hands and within three days i will build another made
without hands
but neither so did their witness agree together
and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus
saying answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against
thee   but he held his peace and answered nothing again the
high priest asked him and said unto him art thou the christ the son
of the blessed   and jesus said i am and ye shall see the son
of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of
heaven
then the high priest rent his clothes and saith what need we
any further witnesses   ye have heard the blasphemy what think
ye and they all condemned him to be guilty of death
and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to
buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants did strike
him with the palms of their hands
and as peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of the
maids of the high priest  and when she saw peter warming
himself she looked upon him and said and thou also wast with jesus
of nazareth
but he denied saying i know not neither understand i what
thou sayest and he went out into the porch and the cock crew
and a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stood
by this is one of them
and he denied it again and a little after they that stood by
said again to peter surely thou art one of them for thou art a
galilaean and thy speech agreeth thereto
but he began to curse and to swear saying i know not this man
of whom ye speak
and the second time the cock crew and peter called to mind the
word that jesus said unto him before the cock crow twice thou shalt
deny me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept
and straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council and
bound jesus and carried him away and delivered him to pilate
and pilate asked him art thou the king of the jews and he
answering said unto them thou sayest it
and the chief priests accused him of many things but he answered
nothing
and pilate asked him again saying answerest thou nothing
behold how many things they witness against thee
but jesus yet answered nothing so that pilate marvelled
now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner whomsoever
they desired
and there was one named barabbas which lay bound with them that
had made insurrection with him who had committed murder in the
insurrection
and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
had ever done unto them
but pilate answered them saying will ye that i release unto you
the king of the jews   for he knew that the chief priests had
delivered him for envy
but the chief priests moved the people that he should rather
release barabbas unto them
and pilate answered and said again unto them what will ye then
that i shall do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews   and
they cried out again crucify him
then pilate said unto them why what evil hath he done and
they cried out the more exceedingly crucify him
and so pilate willing to content the people released barabbas
unto them and delivered jesus when he had scourged him to be
crucified
and the soldiers led him away into the hall called praetorium
and they call together the whole band
and they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns
and put it about his head  and began to salute him hail king
of the jews   and they smote him on the head with a reed and
did spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him
and when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him
and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him
and they compel one simon a cyrenian who passed by coming out
of the country the father of alexander and rufus to bear his cross
and they bring him unto the place golgotha which is being
interpreted the place of a skull
and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he
received it not
and when they had crucified him they parted his garments
casting lots upon them what every man should take
and it was the third hour and they crucified him
and the superscription of his accusation was written over the
king of the jews
and with him they crucify two thieves the one on his right
hand and the other on his left
and the scripture was fulfilled which saith and he was
numbered with the transgressors
and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and
saying ah thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three
days  save thyself and come down from the cross
likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
with the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save
let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross that
we may see and believe and they that were crucified with him reviled
him
and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the
whole land until the ninth hour
and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying
eloi eloi lama sabachthani which is being interpreted my god my
god why hast thou forsaken me   and some of them that stood by
when they heard it said behold he calleth elias
and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar and put it on a
reed and gave him to drink saying let alone let us see whether
elias will come to take him down
and jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost
and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
bottom
and when the centurion which stood over against him saw that
he so cried out and gave up the ghost he said truly this man was
the son of god
there were also women looking on afar off among whom was mary
magdalene and mary the mother of james the less and of joses and
salome  who also when he was in galilee followed him and
ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto
jerusalem
and now when the even was come because it was the preparation
that is the day before the sabbath  joseph of arimathaea an
honourable counsellor which also waited for the kingdom of god came
and went in boldly unto pilate and craved the body of jesus
and pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling unto
him the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while dead
and when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body to
joseph
and he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in
the linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock
and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre
and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where he
was laid
and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the
mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might
come and anoint him
and very early in the morning the first day of the week they
came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun
and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone
from the door of the sepulchre   and when they looked they saw
that the stone was rolled away for it was very great
and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on
the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were
affrighted
and he saith unto them be not affrighted ye seek jesus of
nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the
place where they laid him
but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth
before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you
and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they
trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man for
they were afraid
now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he
appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven
devils
and she went and told them that had been with him as they
mourned and wept
and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been
seen of her believed not
after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they
walked and went into the country
and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed
they them
afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and
upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they
believed not them which had seen him after he was risen
and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the
gospel to every creature
he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that
believeth not shall be damned
and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall
they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues  they
shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall
not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall
recover
so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up
into heaven and sat on the right hand of god
and they went forth and preached every where the lord working
with them and confirming the word with signs following amen
the gospel according to saint luke
forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us
even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were
eyewitnesses and ministers of the word  it seemed good to me
also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very
first to write unto thee in order most excellent theophilus
that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou
hast been instructed
there was in the days of herod the king of judaea a certain
priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the
daughters of aaron and her name was elisabeth
and they were both righteous before god walking in all the
commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless
and they had no child because that elisabeth was barren and they
both were now well stricken in years
and it came to pass that while he executed the priests office
before god in the order of his course  according to the custom of
the priests office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the
temple of the lord
and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the
time of incense
and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the
right side of the altar of incense
and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon
him
but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer
is heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt
call his name john
and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at
his birth
for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink
neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy
ghost even from his mothers womb
and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord
their god
and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to
turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to
the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord
and zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for
i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years
and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand
in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to shew
thee these glad tidings
and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the
day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not
my words which shall be fulfilled in their season
and the people waited for zacharias and marvelled that he
tarried so long in the temple
and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they
perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned
unto them and remained speechless
and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his
ministration were accomplished he departed to his own house
and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived and hid
herself five months saying  thus hath the lord dealt with me in
the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men
and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a
city of galilee named nazareth  to a virgin espoused to a man
whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgins name
was mary
and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art
highly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women
and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in
her mind what manner of salutation this should be
and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found
favour with god
and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a
son and shalt call his name jesus
he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest
and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david
and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his
kingdom there shall be no end
then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know
not a man   and the angel answered and said unto her the holy
ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall
overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
thee shall be called the son of god
and behold thy cousin elisabeth she hath also conceived a son
in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called
barren
for with god nothing shall be impossible
and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me
according to thy word and the angel departed from her
and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with
haste into a city of juda  and entered into the house of
zacharias and saluted elisabeth
and it came to pass that when elisabeth heard the salutation of
mary the babe leaped in her womb and elisabeth was filled with the
holy ghost  and she spake out with a loud voice and said
blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come
to me   for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded
in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy
and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a
performance of those things which were told her from the lord
and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord  and my spirit
hath rejoiced in god my saviour
for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden for
behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed
for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is
his name
and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
generation
he hath shewed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud
in the imagination of their hearts
he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of
low degree
he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath
sent empty away
he hath holpen his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy
as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed for ever
and mary abode with her about three months and returned to her
own house
now elisabeths full time came that she should be delivered and
she brought forth a son
and her neighbours and her cousins heard how the lord had shewed
great mercy upon her and they rejoiced with her
and it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to
circumcise the child and they called him zacharias after the name of
his father
and his mother answered and said not so but he shall be called
john
and they said unto her there is none of thy kindred that is
called by this name
and they made signs to his father how he would have him called
and he asked for a writing table and wrote saying his name is
john and they marvelled all
and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed and
he spake and praised god
and fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these
sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts
saying what manner of child shall this be and the hand of the lord
was with him
and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and
prophesied saying  blessed be the lord god of israel for he
hath visited and redeemed his people  and hath raised up an horn
of salvation for us in the house of his servant david  as he
spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the
world began  that we should be saved from our enemies and from
the hand of all that hate us  to perform the mercy promised to
our fathers and to remember his holy covenant  the oath which he
sware to our father abraham  that he would grant unto us that we
being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without
fear  in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of
our life
and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the highest for
thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways  to
give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their
sins  through the tender mercy of our god whereby the dayspring
from on high hath visited us  to give light to them that sit in
darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of
peace
and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the
deserts till the day of his shewing unto israel
and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree
from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed
and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of
syria   and all went to be taxed every one into his own city
and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth
into judaea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem
because he was of the house and lineage of david  to be taxed
with mary his espoused wife being great with child
and so it was that while they were there the days were
accomplished that she should be delivered
and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in
swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room
for them in the inn
and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field
keeping watch over their flock by night
and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of
the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid
and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you
good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people
for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour
which is christ the lord
and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped
in swaddling clothes lying in a manger
and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
host praising god and saying  glory to god in the highest and
on earth peace good will toward men
and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into
heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto
bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the lord
hath made known unto us
and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the
babe lying in a manger
and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying
which was told them concerning this child
and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were
told them by the shepherds
but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart
and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all
the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them
and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the
child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel
before he was conceived in the womb
and when the days of her purification according to the law of
moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him
to the lord  as it is written in the law of the lord every male
that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord  and to
offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the
lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons
and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon
and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of
israel and the holy ghost was upon him
and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should
not see death before he had seen the lords christ
and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents
brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law
then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said
lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy
word  for mine eyes have seen thy salvation  which thou hast
prepared before the face of all people  a light to lighten the
gentiles and the glory of thy people israel
and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were
spoken of him
and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold
this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and
for a sign which shall be spoken against  yea a sword shall
pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts
may be revealed
and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel of
the tribe of aser she was of a great age and had lived with an
husband seven years from her virginity  and she was a widow of
about fourscore and four years which departed not from the temple
but served god with fastings and prayers night and day
and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the
lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in
jerusalem
and when they had performed all things according to the law of
the lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth
and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with
wisdom and the grace of god was upon him
now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the
passover
and when he was twelve years old they went up to jerusalem after
the custom of the feast
and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child
jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not
of it
but they supposing him to have been in the company went a days
journey and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance
and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem
seeking him
and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the
temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and
asking them questions
and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and
answers
and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto
him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i
have sought thee sorrowing
and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wist ye not
that i must be about my fathers business   and they understood
not the saying which he spake unto them
and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject
unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart
and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with god
and man
now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar pontius
pilate being governor of judaea and herod being tetrarch of galilee
and his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region of
trachonitis and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene  annas and
caiaphas being the high priests the word of god came unto john the
son of zacharias in the wilderness
and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the
baptism of repentance for the remission of sins  as it is written
in the book of the words of esaias the prophet saying the voice of
one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his
paths straight
every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be
brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough
ways shall be made smooth  and all flesh shall see the salvation
of god
then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of
him o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the
wrath to come   bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance
and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father
for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up
children unto abraham
and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees every
tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and
cast into the fire
and the people asked him saying what shall we do then   he
answereth and saith unto them he that hath two coats let him impart
to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewise
then came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him
master what shall we do   and he said unto them exact no more
than that which is appointed you
and the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shall
we do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse
any falsely and be content with your wages
and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their
hearts of john whether he were the christ or not  john
answered saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water but
one mightier than i cometh the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy
to unloose he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire
whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor
and will gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burn
with fire unquenchable
and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
people
but herod the tetrarch being reproved by him for herodias his
brother philips wife and for all the evils which herod had done
added yet this above all that he shut up john in prison
now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that
jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened
and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him
and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son in
thee i am well pleased
and jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age being
as was supposed the son of joseph which was the son of heli
which was the son of matthat which was the son of levi which was the
son of melchi which was the son of janna which was the son of
joseph  which was the son of mattathias which was the son of
amos which was the son of naum which was the son of esli which was
the son of nagge  which was the son of maath which was the son
of mattathias which was the son of semei which was the son of
joseph which was the son of juda  which was the son of joanna
which was the son of rhesa which was the son of zorobabel which was
the son of salathiel which was the son of neri  which was the
son of melchi which was the son of addi which was the son of cosam
which was the son of elmodam which was the son of er  which was
the son of jose which was the son of eliezer which was the son of
jorim which was the son of matthat which was the son of levi
which was the son of simeon which was the son of juda which was the
son of joseph which was the son of jonan which was the son of
eliakim  which was the son of melea which was the son of menan
which was the son of mattatha which was the son of nathan which was
the son of david  which was the son of jesse which was the son
of obed which was the son of booz which was the son of salmon which
was the son of naasson  which was the son of aminadab which was
the son of aram which was the son of esrom which was the son of
phares which was the son of juda  which was the son of jacob
which was the son of isaac which was the son of abraham which was
the son of thara which was the son of nachor  which was the son
of saruch which was the son of ragau which was the son of phalec
which was the son of heber which was the son of sala  which was
the son of cainan which was the son of arphaxad which was the son of
sem which was the son of noe which was the son of lamech  which
was the son of mathusala which was the son of enoch which was the
son of jared which was the son of maleleel which was the son of
cainan  which was the son of enos which was the son of seth
which was the son of adam which was the son of god
and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and
was led by the spirit into the wilderness  being forty days
tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when
they were ended he afterward hungered
and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command
this stone that it be made bread
and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not
live by bread alone but by every word of god
and the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto
him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time
and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and
the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i
will i give it
if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine
and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan
for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only
shalt thou serve
and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the
temple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself
down from hence  for it is written he shall give his angels
charge over thee to keep thee  and in their hands they shall
bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone
and jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not
tempt the lord thy god
and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from
him for a season
and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and
there went out a fame of him through all the region round about
and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all
and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as
his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and
stood up for to read
and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias
and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was
written  the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath
anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal
the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and
recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are
bruised  to preach the acceptable year of the lord
and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and
sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were
fastened on him
and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture
fulfilled in your ears
and all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious words
which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this josephs
son   and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this
proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in
capernaum do also here in thy country
and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his
own country
but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days
of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when
great famine was throughout all the land  but unto none of them
was elias sent save unto sarepta a city of sidon unto a woman that
was a widow
and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the
prophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian
and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were
filled with wrath  and rose up and thrust him out of the city
and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built
that they might cast him down headlong
but he passing through the midst of them went his way  and
came down to capernaum a city of galilee and taught them on the
sabbath days
and they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with
power
and in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an
unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice  saying let us
alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou
come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god
and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of
him
and when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of him
and hurt him not
and they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying
what a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the
unclean spirits and they come out
and the fame of him went out into every place of the country
round about
and he arose out of the synagogue and entered into simons
house
and simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and they
besought him for her
and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her
and immediately she arose and ministered unto them
now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with
divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every
one of them and healed them
and devils also came out of many crying out and saying thou
art christ the son of god and he rebuking them suffered them not to
speak for they knew that he was christ
and when it was day he departed and went into a desert place
and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him that he
should not depart from them
and he said unto them i must preach the kingdom of god to other
cities also for therefore am i sent
and he preached in the synagogues of galilee
and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear
the word of god he stood by the lake of gennesaret  and saw two
ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them
and were washing their nets
and he entered into one of the ships which was simons and
prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat
down and taught the people out of the ship
now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out into
the deep and let down your nets for a draught
and simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all the
night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i will let
down the net
and when they had this done they inclosed a great multitude of
fishes and their net brake
and they beckoned unto their partners which were in the other
ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled
both the ships so that they began to sink
when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying
depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord
for he was astonished and all that were with him at the draught
of the fishes which they had taken  and so was also james and
john the sons of zebedee which were partners with simon and jesus
said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men
and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all
and followed him
and it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man
full of leprosy who seeing jesus fell on his face and besought him
saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean
and he put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be
thou clean and immediately the leprosy departed from him
and he charged him to tell no man but go and shew thyself to
the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as moses commanded
for a testimony unto them
but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and great
multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their
infirmities
and he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed
and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that
there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were
come out of every town of galilee and judaea and jerusalem and the
power of the lord was present to heal them
and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a
palsy and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before
him
and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in
because of the multitude they went upon the housetop and let him
down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before jesus
and when he saw their faith he said unto him man thy sins are
forgiven thee
and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason saying who is
this which speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
but when jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto
them what reason ye in your hearts   whether is easier to say
thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk   but that
ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins
he said unto the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise and take
up thy couch and go into thine house
and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon
he lay and departed to his own house glorifying god
and they were all amazed and they glorified god and were filled
with fear saying we have seen strange things to day
and after these things he went forth and saw a publican named
levi sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him follow
me
and he left all rose up and followed him
and levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a
great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them
but their scribes and pharisees murmured against his disciples
saying why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners   and
jesus answering said unto them they that are whole need not a
physician but they that are sick
i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
and they said unto him why do the disciples of john fast often
and make prayers and likewise the disciples of the pharisees but
thine eat and drink   and he said unto them can ye make the
children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them
but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them and then shall they fast in those days
and he spake also a parable unto them no man putteth a piece of
a new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a
rent and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the
old
and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine
will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perish
but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are
preserved
no man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new for
he saith the old is better
and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he
went through the corn fields and his disciples plucked the ears of
corn and did eat rubbing them in their hands
and certain of the pharisees said unto them why do ye that which
is not lawful to do on the sabbath days   and jesus answering them
said have ye not read so much as this what david did when himself
was an hungred and they which were with him  how he went into the
house of god and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also to
them that were with him which it is not lawful to eat but for the
priests alone   and he said unto them that the son of man is lord
also of the sabbath
and it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into
the synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand was
withered
and the scribes and pharisees watched him whether he would heal
on the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him
but he knew their thoughts and said to the man which had the
withered hand rise up and stand forth in the midst and he arose and
stood forth
then said jesus unto them i will ask you one thing is it lawful
on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil to save life or to
destroy it   and looking round about upon them all he said unto
the man stretch forth thy hand and he did so and his hand was
restored whole as the other
and they were filled with madness and communed one with another
what they might do to jesus
and it came to pass in those days that he went out into a
mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to god
and when it was day he called unto him his disciples and of
them he chose twelve whom also he named apostles  simon whom
he also named peter and andrew his brother james and john philip
and bartholomew  matthew and thomas james the son of alphaeus
and simon called zelotes  and judas the brother of james and
judas iscariot which also was the traitor
and he came down with them and stood in the plain and the
company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all
judaea and jerusalem and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon which
came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases  and they
that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed
and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went
virtue out of him and healed them all
and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be
ye poor for yours is the kingdom of god
blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed
are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh
blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall
separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out
your name as evil for the son of mans sake
rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your
reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers
unto the prophets
but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your
consolation
woe unto you that are full for ye shall hunger woe unto you
that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep
woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did
their fathers to the false prophets
but i say unto you which hear love your enemies do good to them
which hate you  bless them that curse you and pray for them
which despitefully use you
and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the
other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat
also
give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh
away thy goods ask them not again
and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them
likewise
for if ye love them which love you what thank have ye for
sinners also love those that love them
and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have
ye  for sinners also do even the same
and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank
have ye for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again
but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for
nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the
children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the
evil
be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful
judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall
not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven  give and it
shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken
together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with
the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you
again
and he spake a parable unto them can the blind lead the blind
shall they not both fall into the ditch   the disciple is not
above his master but every one that is perfect shall be as his
master
and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but
perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye   either how
canst thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote that
is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in
thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine
own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is
in thy brothers eye
for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit
for every tree is known by his own fruit for of thorns men do
not gather figs nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes
a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth
that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his
heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the
heart his mouth speaketh
and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i
say   whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth
them i will shew you to whom he is like  he is like a man which
built an house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock
and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house
and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock
but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a
foundation built an house upon the earth against which the stream did
beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house
was great
now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the
people he entered into capernaum
and a certain centurions servant who was dear unto him was
sick and ready to die
and when he heard of jesus he sent unto him the elders of the
jews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant
and when they came to jesus they besought him instantly saying
that he was worthy for whom he should do this  for he loveth our
nation and he hath built us a synagogue
then jesus went with them and when he was now not far from the
house the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him lord
trouble not thyself for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter
under my roof  wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come
unto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be healed
for i also am a man set under authority having under me soldiers
and i say unto one go and he goeth and to another come and he
cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it
when jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned him
about and said unto the people that followed him i say unto you i
have not found so great faith no not in israel
and they that were sent returning to the house found the
servant whole that had been sick
and it came to pass the day after that he went into a city
called nain and many of his disciples went with him and much people
now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was
a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a
widow and much people of the city was with her
and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said
unto her weep not
and he came and touched the bier and they that bare him stood
still
and he said young man i say unto thee arise
and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered
him to his mother
and there came a fear on all and they glorified god saying
that a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visited
his people
and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea and
throughout all the region round about
and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things
and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to
jesus saying art thou he that should come or look we for another
when the men were come unto him they said john baptist hath
sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or look we
for another   and in that same hour he cured many of their
infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were
blind he gave sight
then jesus answering said unto them go your way and tell john
what things ye have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame
walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised to
the poor the gospel is preached
and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me
and when the messengers of john were departed he began to speak
unto the people concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness
for to see  a reed shaken with the wind   but what went ye out
for to see a man clothed in soft raiment  behold they which are
gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courts
but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you
and much more than a prophet
this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger
before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
for i say unto you among those that are born of women there is
not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least in
the kingdom of god is greater than he
and all the people that heard him and the publicans justified
god being baptized with the baptism of john
but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against
themselves being not baptized of him
and the lord said whereunto then shall i liken the men of this
generation and to what are they like   they are like unto
children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and
saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have
mourned to you and ye have not wept
for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine
and ye say he hath a devil
the son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say behold a
gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners
but wisdom is justified of all her children
and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him
and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meat
and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she
knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an
alabaster box of ointment  and stood at his feet behind him
weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with
the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the
ointment
now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spake
within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have
known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she
is a sinner
and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say
unto thee and he saith master say on
there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed
five hundred pence and the other fifty
and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both
tell me therefore which of them will love him most   simon
answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most
and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged
and he turned to the woman and said unto simon seest thou this
woman i entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my
feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the
hairs of her head
thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in
hath not ceased to kiss my feet
my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath
anointed my feet with ointment
wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are
forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same
loveth little
and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within
themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also   and he said to
the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace
and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city
and village preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of
god and the twelve were with him  and certain women which had
been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene
out of whom went seven devils  and joanna the wife of chuza
herods steward and susanna and many others which ministered unto
him of their substance
and when much people were gathered together and were come to him
out of every city he spake by a parable  a sower went out to sow
his seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it was
trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it
and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it
withered away because it lacked moisture
and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and
choked it
and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an
hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath
ears to hear let him hear
and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be
and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they might not
see and hearing they might not understand
now the parable is this the seed is the word of god
those by the way side are they that hear then cometh the devil
and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe
and be saved
they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the
word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and
in time of temptation fall away
and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have
heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of
this life and bring no fruit to perfection
but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good
heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with
patience
no man when he hath lighted a candle covereth it with a vessel
or putteth it under a bed but setteth it on a candlestick that they
which enter in may see the light
for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neither
any thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad
take heed therefore how ye hear for whosoever hath to him shall
be given and whosoever hath not from him shall be taken even that
which he seemeth to have
then came to him his mother and his brethren and could not come
at him for the press
and it was told him by certain which said thy mother and thy
brethren stand without desiring to see thee
and he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren are
these which hear the word of god and do it
now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship
with his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the
other side of the lake and they launched forth
but as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of
wind on the lake and they were filled with water and were in
jeopardy
and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we
perish then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the
water and they ceased and there was a calm
and he said unto them where is your faith and they being afraid
wondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for he
commandeth even the winds and water and they obey him
and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes which is over
against galilee
and when he went forth to land there met him out of the city a
certain man which had devils long time and ware no clothes neither
abode in any house but in the tombs
when he saw jesus he cried out and fell down before him and
with a loud voice said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son
of god most high i beseech thee torment me not
for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man
for oftentimes it had caught him and he was kept bound with chains
and in fetters and he brake the bands and was driven of the devil
into the wilderness   and jesus asked him saying what is thy
name and he said legion because many devils were entered into him
and they besought him that he would not command them to go out
into the deep
and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the
mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter
into them and he suffered them
then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine
and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were
choked
when they that fed them saw what was done they fled and went
and told it in the city and in the country
then they went out to see what was done and came to jesus and
found the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at the
feet of jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid
they also which saw it told them by what means he that was
possessed of the devils was healed
then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes round
about besought him to depart from them for they were taken with great
fear and he went up into the ship and returned back again
now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him
that he might be with him but jesus sent him away saying
return to thine own house and shew how great things god hath done
unto thee and he went his way and published throughout the whole
city how great things jesus had done unto him
and it came to pass that when jesus was returned the people
gladly received him for they were all waiting for him
and behold there came a man named jairus and he was a ruler of
the synagogue and he fell down at jesus feet and besought him that
he would come into his house  for he had one only daughter about
twelve years of age and she lay a dying but as he went the people
thronged him
and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years which had
spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any
came behind him and touched the border of his garment and
immediately her issue of blood stanched
and jesus said who touched me when all denied peter and they
that were with him said master the multitude throng thee and press
thee and sayest thou who touched me   and jesus said somebody
hath touched me for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me
and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling
and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the
people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed
immediately
and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith
hath made thee whole go in peace
while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the
synagogues house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not
the master
but when jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not
believe only and she shall be made whole
and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in
save peter and james and john and the father and the mother of the
maiden
and all wept and bewailed her but he said weep not she is not
dead but sleepeth
and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead
and he put them all out and took her by the hand and called
saying maid arise
and her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he
commanded to give her meat
and her parents were astonished but he charged them that they
should tell no man what was done
then he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power
and authority over all devils and to cure diseases
and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the
sick
and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neither
staves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two
coats apiece
and whatsoever house ye enter into there abide and thence
depart
and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city
shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them
and they departed and went through the towns preaching the
gospel and healing every where
now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he
was perplexed because that it was said of some that john was risen
from the dead  and of some that elias had appeared and of
others that one of the old prophets was risen again
and herod said john have i beheaded but who is this of whom i
hear such things and he desired to see him
and the apostles when they were returned told him all that they
had done and he took them and went aside privately into a desert
place belonging to the city called bethsaida
and the people when they knew it followed him and he received
them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and healed them that
had need of healing
and when the day began to wear away then came the twelve and
said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the
towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals for we are
here in a desert place
but he said unto them give ye them to eat and they said we
have no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go and
buy meat for all this people
for they were about five thousand men and he said to his
disciples make them sit down by fifties in a company
and they did so and made them all sit down
then he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up
to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to
set before the multitude
and they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up of
fragments that remained to them twelve baskets
and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were
with him and he asked them saying whom say the people that i am
they answering said john the baptist but some say elias and
others say that one of the old prophets is risen again
he said unto them but whom say ye that i am peter answering
said the christ of god
and he straitly charged them and commanded them to tell no man
that thing  saying the son of man must suffer many things and
be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be slain
and be raised the third day
and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him
deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me
for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever
will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it
for what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and
lose himself or be cast away   for whosoever shall be ashamed of
me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he
shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the holy
angels
but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which
shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god
and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he
took peter and john and james and went up into a mountain to pray
and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and
his raiment was white and glistering
and behold there talked with him two men which were moses and
elias  who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he
should accomplish at jerusalem
but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and
when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood
with him
and it came to pass as they departed from him peter said unto
jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three
tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias not
knowing what he said
while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them
and they feared as they entered into the cloud
and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my
beloved son hear him
and when the voice was past jesus was found alone and they kept
it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they
had seen
and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come
down from the hill much people met him
and behold a man of the company cried out saying master i
beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine only child
and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it
teareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departeth
from him
and i besought thy disciples to cast him out and they could not
and jesus answering said o faithless and perverse generation
how long shall i be with you and suffer you bring thy son hither
and as he was yet a coming the devil threw him down and tare
him
and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and
delivered him again to his father
and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god but while
they wondered every one at all things which jesus did he said unto
his disciples  let these sayings sink down into your ears for
the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men
but they understood not this saying and it was hid from them
that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying
then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be
greatest
and jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child
and set him by him  and said unto them whosoever shall receive
this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me
receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the
same shall be great
and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils
in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us
and jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not
against us is for us
and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be
received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem  and
sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a
village of the samaritans to make ready for him
and they did not receive him because his face was as though he
would go to jerusalem
and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord
wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume
them even as elias did   but he turned and rebuked them and
said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of
for the son of man is not come to destroy mens lives but to
save them and they went to another village
and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man
said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest
and jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the air
have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head
and he said unto another follow me but he said lord suffer me
first to go and bury my father
jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou
and preach the kingdom of god
and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first
go bid them farewell which are at home at my house
and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the
plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god
after these things the lord appointed other seventy also and
sent them two and two before his face into every city and place
whither he himself would come
therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the
labourers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he
would send forth labourers into his harvest
go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves
carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes and salute no man by
the way
and into whatsoever house ye enter first say peace be to this
house
and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it
if not it shall turn to you again
and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as
they give for the labourer is worthy of his hire go not from house
to house
and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such
things as are set before you  and heal the sick that are therein
and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you
but into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not go
your ways out into the streets of the same and say  even the
very dust of your city which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against
you notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god is
come nigh unto you
but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that day
for sodom than for that city
woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the
mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which have been done in
you they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth and
ashes
but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the
judgment than for you
and thou capernaum which art exalted to heaven shalt be
thrust down to hell
he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you
despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me
and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the
devils are subject unto us through thy name
and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from
heaven
behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and
scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by
any means hurt you
notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are
subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written
in heaven
in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee o
father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from
the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so
father for so it seemed good in thy sight
all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth
who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son
and he to whom the son will reveal him
and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately
blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see  for i
tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those
things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things
which ye hear and have not heard them
and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying
master what shall i do to inherit eternal life   he said unto
him what is written in the law how readest thou   and he
answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart
and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy
mind and thy neighbour as thyself
and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and
thou shalt live
but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who is
my neighbour   and jesus answering said a certain man went down
from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him
of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and
when he saw him he passed by on the other side
and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked
on him and passed by on the other side
but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and
when he saw him he had compassion on him  and went to him and
bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own
beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and
gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and
whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee
which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him
that fell among the thieves   and he said he that shewed mercy
on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise
now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a
certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into
her house
and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet
and heard his word
but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and
said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve
alone  bid her therefore that she help me
and jesus answered and said unto her martha martha thou art
careful and troubled about many things  but one thing is
needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken
away from her
and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place
when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to
pray as john also taught his disciples
and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in
heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as
in heaven so in earth
give us day by day our daily bread
and forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is
indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from
evil
and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and
shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three
loaves  for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and i
have nothing to set before him   and he from within shall answer
and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are
with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee
i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he
is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give
him as many as he needeth
and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye
shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh
findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he
give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a
serpent   or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a
scorpion   if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts
unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the
holy spirit to them that ask him   and he was casting out a
devil and it was dumb and it came to pass when the devil was gone
out the dumb spake and the people wondered
but some of them said he casteth out devils through beelzebub
the chief of the devils
and others tempting him sought of him a sign from heaven
but he knowing their thoughts said unto them every kingdom
divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house divided
against a house falleth
if satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom
stand because ye say that i cast out devils through beelzebub
and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your sons cast
them out therefore shall they be your judges
but if i with the finger of god cast out devils no doubt the
kingdom of god is come upon you
when a strong man armed keepeth his palace his goods are in
peace  but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and
overcome him he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted
and divideth his spoils
he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth
when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through
dry places seeking rest and finding none he saith i will return
unto my house whence i came out
and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnished
then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked
than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state
of that man is worse than the first
and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman
of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the
womb that bare thee and the paps which thou hast sucked
but he said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of
god and keep it
and when the people were gathered thick together he began to
say this is an evil generation they seek a sign and there shall no
sign be given it but the sign of jonas the prophet
for as jonas was a sign unto the ninevites so shall also the
son of man be to this generation
the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the
men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the utmost
parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a
greater than solomon is here
the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching
of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here
no man when he hath lighted a candle putteth it in a secret
place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which
come in may see the light
the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is
single thy whole body also is full of light but when thine eye is
evil thy body also is full of darkness
take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
darkness
if thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part
dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of
a candle doth give thee light
and as he spake a certain pharisee besought him to dine with
him and he went in and sat down to meat
and when the pharisee saw it he marvelled that he had not first
washed before dinner
and the lord said unto him now do ye pharisees make clean the
outside of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full of
ravening and wickedness
ye fools did not he that made that which is without make that
which is within also   but rather give alms of such things as ye
have and behold all things are clean unto you
but woe unto you pharisees for ye tithe mint and rue and all
manner of herbs and pass over judgment and the love of god these
ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone
woe unto you pharisees for ye love the uppermost seats in the
synagogues and greetings in the markets
woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are as
graves which appear not and the men that walk over them are not aware
of them
then answered one of the lawyers and said unto him master
thus saying thou reproachest us also
and he said woe unto you also ye lawyers for ye lade men with
burdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdens
with one of your fingers
woe unto you for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and
your fathers killed them
truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers
for they indeed killed them and ye build their sepulchres
therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophets
and apostles and some of them they shall slay and persecute
that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation
of the world may be required of this generation  from the blood
of abel unto the blood of zacharias which perished between the altar
and the temple verily i say unto you it shall be required of this
generation
woe unto you lawyers for ye have taken away the key of
knowledge ye entered not in yourselves and them that were entering
in ye hindered
and as he said these things unto them the scribes and the
pharisees began to urge him vehemently and to provoke him to speak of
many things  laying wait for him and seeking to catch something
out of his mouth that they might accuse him
in the mean time when there were gathered together an
innumerable multitude of people insomuch that they trode one upon
another he began to say unto his disciples first of all beware ye of
the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy
for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither
hid that shall not be known
therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in
the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall
be proclaimed upon the housetops
and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill
the body and after that have no more that they can do
but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which after
he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear
him
are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them
is forgotten before god   but even the very hairs of your head
are all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many
sparrows
also i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men him
shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god  but
he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of
god
and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man it
shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy
ghost it shall not be forgiven
and when they bring you unto the synagogues and unto
magistrates and powers take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall
answer or what ye shall say  for the holy ghost shall teach you
in the same hour what ye ought to say
and one of the company said unto him master speak to my
brother that he divide the inheritance with me
and he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider over
you   and he said unto them take heed and beware of
covetousness for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the
things which he possesseth
and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a
certain rich man brought forth plentifully  and he thought
within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where
to bestow my fruits   and he said this will i do i will pull
down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my
fruits and my goods
and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up
for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry
but god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be
required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast
provided   so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is
not rich toward god
and he said unto his disciples therefore i say unto you take
no thought for your life what ye shall eat neither for the body
what ye shall put on
the life is more than meat and the body is more than raiment
consider the ravens for they neither sow nor reap which
neither have storehouse nor barn and god feedeth them how much more
are ye better than the fowls   and which of you with taking
thought can add to his stature one cubit   if ye then be not
able to do that thing which is least why take ye thought for the
rest   consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they
spin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was
not arrayed like one of these
if then god so clothe the grass which is to day in the field
and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you
o ye of little faith   and seek not ye what ye shall eat or
what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind
for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and
your father knoweth that ye have need of these things
but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things
shall be added unto you
fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to
give you the kingdom
sell that ye have and give alms provide yourselves bags which
wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no
thief approacheth neither moth corrupteth
for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
let your loins be girded about and your lights burning
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will
return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may
open unto him immediately
blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall
find watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and
make them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serve them
and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third
watch and find them so blessed are those servants
and this know that if the goodman of the house had known what
hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have
suffered his house to be broken through
be ye therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hour
when ye think not
then peter said unto him lord speakest thou this parable unto
us or even to all   and the lord said who then is that
faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall make ruler over his
household to give them their portion of meat in due season
blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so
doing
of a truth i say unto you that he will make him ruler over all
that he hath
but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth his
coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens and to
eat and drink and to be drunken  the lord of that servant will
come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is
not aware and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him his
portion with the unbelievers
and that servant which knew his lords will and prepared not
himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many
stripes
but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes
shall be beaten with few stripes for unto whomsoever much is given
of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of
him they will ask the more
i am come to send fire on the earth and what will i if it be
already kindled   but i have a baptism to be baptized with and
how am i straitened till it be accomplished   suppose ye that i
am come to give peace on earth i tell you nay but rather division
for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided
three against two and two against three
the father shall be divided against the son and the son against
the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against
the mother the mother in law against her daughter in law and the
daughter in law against her mother in law
and he said also to the people when ye see a cloud rise out of
the west straightway ye say there cometh a shower and so it is
and when ye see the south wind blow ye say there will be heat
and it cometh to pass
ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky and of the
earth but how is it that ye do not discern this time   yea and
why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right   when thou
goest with thine adversary to the magistrate as thou art in the way
give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him lest he hale
thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and the
officer cast thee into prison
i tell thee thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid
the very last mite
there were present at that season some that told him of the
galilaeans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices
and jesus answering said unto them suppose ye that these
galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans because they
suffered such things   i tell you nay but except ye repent ye
shall all likewise perish
or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew
them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in
jerusalem   i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all
likewise perish
he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted
in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none
then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these
three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut
it down why cumbereth it the ground   and he answering said unto
him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and
dung it  and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that
thou shalt cut it down
and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath
and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity
eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up
herself
and when jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her
woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity
and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made
straight and glorified god
and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation
because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day and said unto the
people there are six days in which men ought to work in them
therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath day
the lord then answered him and said thou hypocrite doth not
each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall
and lead him away to watering   and ought not this woman being
a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen
years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day   and when he
had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the
people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him
then said he unto what is the kingdom of god like and
whereunto shall i resemble it   it is like a grain of mustard
seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and
waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of
it
and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god
it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures
of meal till the whole was leavened
and he went through the cities and villages teaching and
journeying toward jerusalem
then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved and
he said unto them  strive to enter in at the strait gate for
many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able
when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to
the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door
saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto
you i know you not whence ye are  then shall ye begin to say
we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou hast taught in our
streets
but he shall say i tell you i know you not whence ye are
depart from me all ye workers of iniquity
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see
abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of
god and you yourselves thrust out
and they shall come from the east and from the west and from
the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of
god
and behold there are last which shall be first and there are
first which shall be last
the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying unto
him get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee
and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast
out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day i
shall be perfected
nevertheless i must walk to day and to morrow and the day
following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem
o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest
them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy
children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and
ye would not   behold your house is left unto you desolate and
verily i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when
ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord
and it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the
chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched
him
and behold there was a certain man before him which had the
dropsy
and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees saying
is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day   and they held their
peace and he took him and healed him and let him go  and
answered them saying which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen
into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day
and they could not answer him again to these things
and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden when he
marked how they chose out the chief rooms saying unto them
when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding sit not down in the
highest room lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him
and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee give this man
place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room
but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest room
that when he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go
up higher then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that
sit at meat with thee
for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that
humbleth himself shall be exalted
then said he also to him that bade him when thou makest a
dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren neither
thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbours lest they also bid thee again
and a recompence be made thee
but when thou makest a feast call the poor the maimed the
lame the blind  and thou shalt be blessed for they cannot
recompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of
the just
and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these
things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the
kingdom of god
then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and
bade many  and sent his servant at supper time to say to them
that were bidden come for all things are now ready
and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first
said unto him i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs go
and see it i pray thee have me excused
and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to
prove them i pray thee have me excused
and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot
come
so that servant came and shewed his lord these things then the
master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly
into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor
and the maimed and the halt and the blind
and the servant said lord it is done as thou hast commanded
and yet there is room
and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and
hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled
for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden
shall taste of my supper
and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and
said unto them  if any man come to me and hate not his father
and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea
and his own life also he cannot be my disciple
and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot
be my disciple
for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down
first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it
lest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able
to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him  saying this
man began to build and was not able to finish
or what king going to make war against another king sitteth
not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to
meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand   or else
while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage and
desireth conditions of peace
so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that
he hath he cannot be my disciple
salt is good but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith
shall it be seasoned   it is neither fit for the land nor yet
for the dunghill but men cast it out he that hath ears to hear let
him hear
then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear
him
and the pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man
receiveth sinners and eateth with them
and he spake this parable unto them saying  what man of
you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave
the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is
lost until he find it   and when he hath found it he layeth it
on his shoulders rejoicing
and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and
neighbours saying unto them rejoice with me for i have found my
sheep which was lost
i say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons
which need no repentance
either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one
piece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek
diligently till she find it   and when she hath found it she
calleth her friends and her neighbours together saying rejoice with
me for i have found the piece which i had lost
likewise i say unto you there is joy in the presence of the
angels of god over one sinner that repenteth
and he said a certain man had two sons  and the younger
of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that
falleth to me and he divided unto them his living
and not many days after the younger son gathered all together
and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his
substance with riotous living
and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that
land and he began to be in want
and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and
he sent him into his fields to feed swine
and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the
swine did eat and no man gave unto him
and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of
my fathers have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger
i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father
i have sinned against heaven and before thee  and am no more
worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants
and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a
great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and
fell on his neck and kissed him
and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven
and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son
but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe
and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat
and be merry  for this my son was dead and is alive again he
was lost and is found and they began to be merry
now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh
to the house he heard musick and dancing
and he called one of the servants and asked what these things
meant
and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath
killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound
and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father
out and intreated him
and he answering said to his father lo these many years do i
serve thee neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment and
yet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merry with my
friends  but as soon as this thy son was come which hath
devoured thy living with harlots thou hast killed for him the fatted
calf
and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that i
have is thine
it was meet that we should make merry and be glad for this thy
brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found
and he said also unto his disciples there was a certain rich
man which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he
had wasted his goods
and he called him and said unto him how is it that i hear this
of thee give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no
longer steward
then the steward said within himself what shall i do for my
lord taketh away from me the stewardship i cannot dig to beg i am
ashamed
i am resolved what to do that when i am put out of the
stewardship they may receive me into their houses
so he called every one of his lords debtors unto him and said
unto the first how much owest thou unto my lord   and he said
an hundred measures of oil and he said unto him take thy bill and
sit down quickly and write fifty
then said he to another and how much owest thou and he said an
hundred measures of wheat and he said unto him take thy bill and
write fourscore
and the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done
wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser
than the children of light
and i say unto you make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into
everlasting habitations
he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in
much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much
if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous
mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches   and if
ye have not been faithful in that which is another mans who shall
give you that which is your own   no servant can serve two
masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else
he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god
and mammon
and the pharisees also who were covetous heard all these
things and they derided him
and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves
before men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is highly
esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god
the law and the prophets were until john since that time the
kingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it
and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle
of the law to fail
whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another
committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from
her husband committeth adultery
there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and
fine linen and fared sumptuously every day  and there was a
certain beggar named lazarus which was laid at his gate full of
sores  and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from
the rich mans table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores
and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by
the angels into abrahams bosom the rich man also died and was
buried  and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and
seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom
and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and
send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool
my tongue for i am tormented in this flame
but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime
receivedst thy good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now
he is comforted and thou art tormented
and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf
fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither
can they pass to us that would come from thence
then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest
send him to my fathers house  for i have five brethren that he
may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment
abraham saith unto him they have moses and the prophets let
them hear them
and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from
the dead they will repent
and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets
neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead
then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but that
offences will come but woe unto him through whom they come   it
were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and
he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little
ones
take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee
rebuke him and if he repent forgive him
and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven
times in a day turn again to thee saying i repent thou shalt
forgive him
and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith
and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye
might say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and
be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you
but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle
will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and
sit down to meat   and will not rather say unto him make ready
wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten
and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink   doth he
thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him
i trow not
so likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which
are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done
that which was our duty to do
and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed
through the midst of samaria and galilee
and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men
that were lepers which stood afar off  and they lifted up their
voices and said jesus master have mercy on us
and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselves unto
the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were
cleansed
and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back
and with a loud voice glorified god  and fell down on his face
at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan
and jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but where
are the nine   there are not found that returned to give glory
to god save this stranger
and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made
thee whole
and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of
god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh
not with observation  neither shall they say lo here or lo
there for behold the kingdom of god is within you
and he said unto the disciples the days will come when ye
shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall
not see it
and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after
them nor follow them
for as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under
heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the
son of man be in his day
but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this
generation
and as it was in the days of noe so shall it be also in the
days of the son of man
they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in
marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and the flood
came and destroyed them all
likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they
drank they bought they sold they planted they builded  but
the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone
from heaven and destroyed them all
even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is
revealed
in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff
in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in
the field let him likewise not return back
remember lots wife
whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and
whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it
i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the
one shall be taken and the other shall be left
two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken
and the other left
two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the
other left
and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said
unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles be
gathered together
and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought
always to pray and not to faint  saying there was in a city a
judge which feared not god neither regarded man  and there was
a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine
adversary
and he would not for a while but afterward he said within
himself though i fear not god nor regard man  yet because this
widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming
she weary me
and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith
and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night
unto him though he bear long with them   i tell you that he will
avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall
he find faith on the earth   and he spake this parable unto
certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and
despised others  two men went up into the temple to pray the
one a pharisee and the other a publican
the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank
thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust
adulterers or even as this publican
i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess
and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much
as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be
merciful to me a sinner
i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather
than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased
and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted
and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch
them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them
but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children
to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of
god
verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein
and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i
do to inherit eternal life   and jesus said unto him why
callest thou me good none is good save one that is god
thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not
kill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father and
thy mother
and he said all these have i kept from my youth up
now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lackest
thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor
and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me
and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very
rich
and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how
hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than
for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god
and they that heard it said who then can be saved   and
he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with
god
then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee
and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man
that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children
for the kingdom of gods sake  who shall not receive manifold
more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting
then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we
go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets
concerning the son of man shall be accomplished
for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be
mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on  and they shall
scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise
again
and they understood none of these things and this saying was
hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken
and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a
certain blind man sat by the way side begging  and hearing the
multitude pass by he asked what it meant
and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by
and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on
me
and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his
peace but he cried so much the more thou son of david have mercy on
me
and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and
when he was come near he asked him  saying what wilt thou that
i shall do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sight
and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved
thee
and immediately he received his sight and followed him
glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto
god
and jesus entered and passed through jericho
and behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chief
among the publicans and he was rich
and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the
press because he was little of stature
and he ran before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see
him for he was to pass that way
and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and
said unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for to day i must
abide at thy house
and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully
and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone
to be guest with a man that is a sinner
and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the
half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken any thing
from any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold
and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this
house forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham
for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
lost
and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable
because he was nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that the
kingdom of god should immediately appear
he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to
receive for himself a kingdom and to return
and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds
and said unto them occupy till i come
but his citizens hated him and sent a message after him
saying we will not have this man to reign over us
and it came to pass that when he was returned having received
the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him
to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man
had gained by trading
then came the first saying lord thy pound hath gained ten
pounds
and he said unto him well thou good servant because thou hast
been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities
and the second came saying lord thy pound hath gained five
pounds
and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities
and another came saying lord behold here is thy pound which
i have kept laid up in a napkin  for i feared thee because thou
art an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down and
reapest that thou didst not sow
and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge thee
thou wicked servant thou knewest that i was an austere man taking up
that i laid not down and reaping that i did not sow  wherefore
then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming i might
have required mine own with usury   and he said unto them that
stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten
pounds
and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds   for i
say unto you that unto every one which hath shall be given and from
him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him
but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over
them bring hither and slay them before me
and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to
jerusalem
and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage and
bethany at the mount called the mount of olives he sent two of his
disciples  saying go ye into the village over against you in
the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied whereon yet
never man sat loose him and bring him hither
and if any man ask you why do ye loose him thus shall ye say
unto him because the lord hath need of him
and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had
said unto them
and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto
them why loose ye the colt   and they said the lord hath need
of him
and they brought him to jesus and they cast their garments upon
the colt and they set jesus thereon
and as he went they spread their clothes in the way
and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount
of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and
praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had
seen  saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the
lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest
and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto
him master rebuke thy disciples
and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these
should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out
and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it
saying if thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy
day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from
thine eyes
for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast
a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every
side  and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children
within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another
because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation
and he went into the temple and began to cast out them that
sold therein and them that bought  saying unto them it is
written my house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of
thieves
and he taught daily in the temple but the chief priests and the
scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him  and
could not find what they might do for all the people were very
attentive to hear him
and it came to pass that on one of those days as he taught the
people in the temple and preached the gospel the chief priests and
the scribes came upon him with the elders  and spake unto him
saying tell us by what authority doest thou these things or who is
he that gave thee this authority   and he answered and said unto
them i will also ask you one thing and answer me  the baptism
of john was it from heaven or of men   and they reasoned with
themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why
then believed ye him not   but and if we say of men all the
people will stone us for they be persuaded that john was a prophet
and they answered that they could not tell whence it was
and jesus said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i
do these things
then began he to speak to the people this parable a certain man
planted a vineyard and let it forth to husbandmen and went into a
far country for a long time
and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they
should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat
him and sent him away empty
and again he sent another servant and they beat him also and
entreated him shamefully and sent him away empty
and again he sent a third and they wounded him also and cast
him out
then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do i will send
my beloved son it may be they will reverence him when they see him
but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves
saying this is the heir come let us kill him that the inheritance
may be ours
so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him what
therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them   he shall
come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to
others and when they heard it they said god forbid
and he beheld them and said what is this then that is written
the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of
the corner   whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be
broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder
and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to
lay hands on him and they feared the people for they perceived that
he had spoken this parable against them
and they watched him and sent forth spies which should feign
themselves just men that they might take hold of his words that so
they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor
and they asked him saying master we know that thou sayest and
teachest rightly neither acceptest thou the person of any but
teachest the way of god truly  is it lawful for us to give
tribute unto caesar or no   but he perceived their craftiness
and said unto them why tempt ye me   shew me a penny whose
image and superscription hath it they answered and said caesars
and he said unto them render therefore unto caesar the things
which be caesars and unto god the things which be gods
and they could not take hold of his words before the people and
they marvelled at his answer and held their peace
then came to him certain of the sadducees which deny that there
is any resurrection and they asked him  saying master moses
wrote unto us if any mans brother die having a wife and he die
without children that his brother should take his wife and raise up
seed unto his brother
there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife
and died without children
and the second took her to wife and he died childless
and the third took her and in like manner the seven also and
they left no children and died
last of all the woman died also
therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she for
seven had her to wife
and jesus answering said unto them the children of this world
marry and are given in marriage  but they which shall be
accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the
dead neither marry nor are given in marriage  neither can they
die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children
of god being the children of the resurrection
now that the dead are raised even moses shewed at the bush
when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and
the god of jacob
for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live
unto him
then certain of the scribes answering said master thou hast
well said
and after that they durst not ask him any question at all
and he said unto them how say they that christ is davids son
and david himself saith in the book of psalms the lord said
unto my lord sit thou on my right hand  till i make thine
enemies thy footstool
david therefore calleth him lord how is he then his son
then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples
beware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes and
love greetings in the markets and the highest seats in the
synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts  which devour widows
houses and for a shew make long prayers the same shall receive
greater damnation
and he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts into
the treasury
and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
mites
and he said of a truth i say unto you that this poor widow hath
cast in more than they all  for all these have of their abundance
cast in unto the offerings of god but she of her penury hath cast in
all the living that she had
and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly
stones and gifts he said  as for these things which ye behold
the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone
upon another that shall not be thrown down
and they asked him saying master but when shall these things
be  and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass
and he said take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall
come in my name saying i am christ and the time draweth near go ye
not therefore after them
but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified
for these things must first come to pass but the end is not by and
by
then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation and
kingdom against kingdom  and great earthquakes shall be in
divers places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and
great signs shall there be from heaven
but before all these they shall lay their hands on you and
persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons
being brought before kings and rulers for my names sake
and it shall turn to you for a testimony
settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what
ye shall answer  for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which
all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist
and ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and
kinsfolks and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to
death
and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake
but there shall not an hair of your head perish
in your patience possess ye your souls
and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know
that the desolation thereof is nigh
then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains and let
them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that
are in the countries enter thereinto
for these be the days of vengeance that all things which are
written may be fulfilled
but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give
suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land
and wrath upon this people
and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led
away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of
the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled
and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the
stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the
sea and the waves roaring  mens hearts failing them for fear
and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for
the powers of heaven shall be shaken
and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with
power and great glory
and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and
lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh
and he spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the
trees  when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own
selves that summer is now nigh at hand
so likewise ye when ye see these things come to pass know ye
that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand
verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till
all be fulfilled
heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass
away
and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life
and so that day come upon you unawares
for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
of the whole earth
watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted
worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to
stand before the son of man
and in the day time he was teaching in the temple and at night
he went out and abode in the mount that is called the mount of
olives
and all the people came early in the morning to him in the
temple for to hear him
now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the
passover
and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him
for they feared the people
then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot being of the
number of the twelve
and he went his way and communed with the chief priests and
captains how he might betray him unto them
and they were glad and covenanted to give him money
and he promised and sought opportunity to betray him unto them
in the absence of the multitude
then came the day of unleavened bread when the passover must be
killed
and he sent peter and john saying go and prepare us the
passover that we may eat
and they said unto him where wilt thou that we prepare
and he said unto them behold when ye are entered into the city
there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water follow him
into the house where he entereth in
and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house the master saith
unto thee where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover
with my disciples   and he shall shew you a large upper room
furnished there make ready
and they went and found as he had said unto them and they made
ready the passover
and when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostles
with him
and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this
passover with you before i suffer  for i say unto you i will
not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god
and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and
divide it among yourselves  for i say unto you i will not drink
of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come
and he took bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave unto
them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in
remembrance of me
likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new
testament in my blood which is shed for you
but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the
table
and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woe
unto that man by whom he is betrayed   and they began to enquire
among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing
and there was also a strife among them which of them should be
accounted the greatest
and he said unto them the kings of the gentiles exercise
lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them are
called benefactors
but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let
him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serve
for whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that
serveth  is not he that sitteth at meat but i am among you as he
that serveth
ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations
and i appoint unto you a kingdom as my father hath appointed
unto me  that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom
and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to
have you that he may sift you as wheat  but i have prayed for
thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen
thy brethren
and he said unto him lord i am ready to go with thee both
into prison and to death
and he said i tell thee peter the cock shall not crow this
day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me
and he said unto them when i sent you without purse and scrip
and shoes lacked ye any thing and they said nothing
then said he unto them but now he that hath a purse let him
take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him
sell his garment and buy one
for i say unto you that this that is written must yet be
accomplished in me and he was reckoned among the transgressors for
the things concerning me have an end
and they said lord behold here are two swords and he said
unto them it is enough
and he came out and went as he was wont to the mount of
olives and his disciples also followed him
and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye
enter not into temptation
and he was withdrawn from them about a stones cast and kneeled
down and prayed  saying father if thou be willing remove
this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done
and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening
him
and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat
was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground
and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples
he found them sleeping for sorrow  and said unto them why sleep
ye rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation
and while he yet spake behold a multitude and he that was
called judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near unto
jesus to kiss him
but jesus said unto him judas betrayest thou the son of man
with a kiss   when they which were about him saw what would
follow they said unto him lord shall we smite with the sword
and one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut
off his right ear
and jesus answered and said suffer ye thus far and he touched
his ear and healed him
then jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the
temple and the elders which were come to him be ye come out as
against a thief with swords and staves   when i was daily with
you in the temple ye stretched forth no hands against me but this is
your hour and the power of darkness
then took they him and led him and brought him into the high
priests house and peter followed afar off
and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and
were set down together peter sat down among them
but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire and
earnestly looked upon him and said this man was also with him
and he denied him saying woman i know him not
and after a little while another saw him and said thou art
also of them and peter said man i am not
and about the space of one hour after another confidently
affirmed saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is
a galilaean
and peter said man i know not what thou sayest and
immediately while he yet spake the cock crew
and the lord turned and looked upon peter and peter remembered
the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow
thou shalt deny me thrice
and peter went out and wept bitterly
and the men that held jesus mocked him and smote him
and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face
and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee   and
many other things blasphemously spake they against him
and as soon as it was day the elders of the people and the
chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their
council saying  art thou the christ tell us and he said unto
them if i tell you ye will not believe  and if i also ask you
ye will not answer me nor let me go
hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the
power of god
then said they all art thou then the son of god and he said
unto them ye say that i am
and they said what need we any further witness for we
ourselves have heard of his own mouth
and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate
and they began to accuse him saying we found this fellow
perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar
saying that he himself is christ a king
and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and
he answered him and said thou sayest it
then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people i find
no fault in this man
and they were the more fierce saying he stirreth up the people
teaching throughout all jewry beginning from galilee to this place
when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man were a
galilaean
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herods
jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also was at jerusalem
at that time
and when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he was
desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things
of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him
then he questioned with him in many words but he answered him
nothing
and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused
him
and herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked him
and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate
and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together
for before they were at enmity between themselves
and pilate when he had called together the chief priests and
the rulers and the people  said unto them ye have brought this
man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold i having
examined him before you have found no fault in this man touching
those things whereof ye accuse him  no nor yet herod for i
sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him
i will therefore chastise him and release him
for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast
and they cried out all at once saying away with this man and
release unto us barabbas  who for a certain sedition made in
the city and for murder was cast into prison   pilate
therefore willing to release jesus spake again to them
but they cried saying crucify him crucify him
and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath he
done i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise
him and let him go
and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might
be crucified and the voices of them and of the chief priests
prevailed
and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required
and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was
cast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered jesus to
their will
and as they led him away they laid hold upon one simon a
cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross
that he might bear it after jesus
and there followed him a great company of people and of women
which also bewailed and lamented him
but jesus turning unto them said daughters of jerusalem weep
not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children
for behold the days are coming in the which they shall say
blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps
which never gave suck
then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and
to the hills cover us
for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done
in the dry   and there were also two other malefactors led
with him to be put to death
and when they were come to the place which is called calvary
there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand
and the other on the left
then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what
they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots
and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them
derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be
christ the chosen of god
and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering
him vinegar  and saying if thou be the king of the jews save
thyself
and a superscription also was written over him in letters of
greek and latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews
and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him
saying if thou be christ save thyself and us
but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear
god seeing thou art in the same condemnation   and we indeed
justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath
done nothing amiss
and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into
thy kingdom
and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee to day shalt
thou be with me in paradise
and it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness over
all the earth until the ninth hour
and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in
the midst
and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father
into thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up
the ghost
now when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god
saying certainly this was a righteous man
and all the people that came together to that sight beholding
the things which were done smote their breasts and returned
and all his acquaintance and the women that followed him from
galilee stood afar off beholding these things
and behold there was a man named joseph a counsellor and he
was a good man and a just  the same had not consented to the
counsel and deed of them he was of arimathaea a city of the jews
who also himself waited for the kingdom of god
this man went unto pilate and begged the body of jesus
and he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a
sepulchre that was hewn in stone wherein never man before was laid
and that day was the preparation and the sabbath drew on
and the women also which came with him from galilee followed
after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid
and they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested
the sabbath day according to the commandment
now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning
they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had
prepared and certain others with them
and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre
and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus
and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout
behold two men stood by them in shining garments  and as they
were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto
them why seek ye the living among the dead   he is not here but
is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee
saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
men and be crucified and the third day rise again
and they remembered his words  and returned from the
sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the
rest
it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james
and other women that were with them which told these things unto the
apostles
and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed
them not
then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down
he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed
wondering in himself at that which was come to pass
and behold two of them went that same day to a village called
emmaus which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs
and they talked together of all these things which had happened
and it came to pass that while they communed together and
reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them
but their eyes were holden that they should not know him
and he said unto them what manner of communications are these
that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad   and the
one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou
only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which are
come to pass there in these days   and he said unto them what
things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which
was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
condemned to death and have crucified him
but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
israel and beside all this to day is the third day since these
things were done
yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished
which were early at the sepulchre  and when they found not his
body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels
which said that he was alive
and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre
and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not
then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe
all that the prophets have spoken  ought not christ to have
suffered these things and to enter into his glory   and
beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all
the scriptures the things concerning himself
and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he
made as though he would have gone further
but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is
toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with
them
and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread
and blessed it and brake and gave to them
and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished
out of their sight
and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us
while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the
scriptures   and they rose up the same hour and returned to
jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were
with them  saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared
to simon
and they told what things were done in the way and how he was
known of them in breaking of bread
and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of
them and saith unto them peace be unto you
but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they
had seen a spirit
and he said unto them why are ye troubled and why do thoughts
arise in your hearts   behold my hands and my feet that it is i
myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as
ye see me have
and when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his
feet
and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said
unto them have ye here any meat   and they gave him a piece of
a broiled fish and of an honeycomb
and he took it and did eat before them
and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto
you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled
which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in
the psalms concerning me
then opened he their understanding that they might understand
the scriptures  and said unto them thus it is written and thus
it behoved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day
and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem
and ye are witnesses of these things
and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry
ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on
high
and he led them out as far as to bethany and he lifted up his
hands and blessed them
and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from
them and carried up into heaven
and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great
joy  and were continually in the temple praising and blessing
god amen
the gospel according to saint john
in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the
word was god
the same was in the beginning with god
all things were made by him and without him was not any thing
made that was made
in him was life and the life was the light of men
and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended
it not
there was a man sent from god whose name was john
the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that
all men through him might believe
he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light
that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into
the world
he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world
knew him not
he came unto his own and his own received him not
but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the
sons of god even to them that believe on his name  which were
born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of
man but of god
and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of
grace and truth
john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom
i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was
before me
and of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace
for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus
christ
no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is
in the bosom of the father he hath declared him
and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and
levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou   and he
confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ
and they asked him what then art thou elias and he saith i am
not art thou that prophet and he answered no
then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer
to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself   he said i am
the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of
the lord as said the prophet esaias
and they which were sent were of the pharisees
and they asked him and said unto him why baptizest thou then
if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet
john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standeth
one among you whom ye know not  he it is who coming after me is
preferred before me whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose
these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john was
baptizing
the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold
the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world
this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is
preferred before me for he was before me
and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to
israel therefore am i come baptizing with water
and john bare record saying i saw the spirit descending from
heaven like a dove and it abode upon him
and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water
the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending
and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy
ghost
and i saw and bare record that this is the son of god
again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples
and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of
god   and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed
jesus
then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them
what seek ye they said unto him rabbi which is to say being
interpreted master where dwellest thou   he saith unto them
come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him
that day for it was about the tenth hour
one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was
andrew simon peters brother
he first findeth his own brother simon and saith unto him we
have found the messias which is being interpreted the christ
and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he said
thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which is
by interpretation a stone
the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth
philip and saith unto him follow me
now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter
philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him
of whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus of
nazareth the son of joseph
and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of
nazareth philip saith unto him come and see
jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold an
israelite indeed in whom is no guile   nathanael saith unto him
whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before that
philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee
nathanael answered and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of
god thou art the king of israel
jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw
thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things
than these
and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter
ye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and
descending upon the son of man
and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the
mother of jesus was there  and both jesus was called and his
disciples to the marriage
and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him
they have no wine
jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee mine
hour is not yet come
his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you
do it
and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner
of the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece
jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water and they
filled them up to the brim
and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor
of the feast and they bare it
when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the
water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom  and
saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine
and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast
kept the good wine until now
this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and
manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him
after this he went down to capernaum he and his mother and his
brethren and his disciples and they continued there not many days
and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to
jerusalem
and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves
and the changers of money sitting  and when he had made a scourge
of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep
and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the
tables  and said unto them that sold doves take these things
hence make not my fathers house an house of merchandise
and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of
thine house hath eaten me up
then answered the jews and said unto him what sign shewest thou
unto us seeing that thou doest these things   jesus answered and
said unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it
up
then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in
building and wilt thou rear it up in three days   but he spake
of the temple of his body
when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples
remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the
scripture and the word which jesus had said
now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast day
many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did
but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all
men  and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew
what was in man
there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the
jews  the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi
we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these
miracles that thou doest except god be with him
jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee
except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old
can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born
jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born
of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born
of the spirit is spirit
marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again
the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound
thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so
is every one that is born of the spirit
nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be
jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel
and knowest not these things   verily verily i say unto thee
we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye
receive not our witness
if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall
ye believe if i tell you of heavenly things   and no man hath
ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son
of man which is in heaven
and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so
must the son of man be lifted up  that whosoever believeth in him
should not perish but have eternal life
for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have
everlasting life
for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but
that the world through him might be saved
he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth
not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of
the only begotten son of god
and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world
and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were
evil
for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to
the light lest his deeds should be reproved
but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may
be made manifest that they are wrought in god
after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of
judaea and there he tarried with them and baptized
and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim because there
was much water there and they came and were baptized
for john was not yet cast into prison
then there arose a question between some of johns disciples and
the jews about purifying
and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was
with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the same
baptizeth and all men come to him
john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be
given him from heaven
ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ
but that i am sent before him
he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the
bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because
of the bridegrooms voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled
he must increase but i must decrease
he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth
is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is
above all
and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man
receiveth his testimony
he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god
is true
for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god
giveth not the spirit by measure unto him
the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his
hand
he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that
believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth
on him
when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that
jesus made and baptized more disciples than john  though jesus
himself baptized not but his disciples  he left judaea and
departed again into galilee
and he must needs go through samaria
then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sychar near
to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph
now jacobs well was there jesus therefore being wearied with
his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour
there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto
her give me to drink
for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat
then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a
jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews
have no dealings with the samaritans
jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of
god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest
have asked of him and he would have given thee living water
the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with
and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water
art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well
and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle
jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water
shall thirst again  but whosoever drinketh of the water that i
shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him
shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life
the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst
not neither come hither to draw
jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither
the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said unto
her thou hast well said i have no husband  for thou hast had
five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that
saidst thou truly
the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a
prophet
our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in
jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship
jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye
shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the
father
ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for
salvation is of the jews
but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall
worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such
to worship him
god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth
the woman saith unto him i know that messias cometh which is
called christ when he is come he will tell us all things
jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he
and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked
with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest
thou with her   the woman then left her waterpot and went her
way into the city and saith to the men  come see a man which
told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ   then
they went out of the city and came unto him
in the mean while his disciples prayed him saying master eat
but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of
therefore said the disciples one to another hath any man brought
him ought to eat   jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the
will of him that sent me and to finish his work
say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh harvest
behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for
they are white already to harvest
and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto
life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice
together
and herein is that saying true one soweth and another reapeth
i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men
laboured and ye are entered into their labours
and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the
saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever i did
so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that
he would tarry with them and he abode there two days
and many more believed because of his own word  and said
unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have
heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the
saviour of the world
now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee
for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his
own country
then when he was come into galilee the galilaeans received him
having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast for
they also went unto the feast
so jesus came again into cana of galilee where he made the water
wine and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at
capernaum
when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee he
went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his
son for he was at the point of death
then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye
will not believe
the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die
jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man
believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way
and as he was now going down his servants met him and told him
saying thy son liveth
then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend and
they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him
so the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which
jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed and his
whole house
this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come
out of judaea into galilee
after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to
jerusalem
now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is
called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches
in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt
withered waiting for the moving of the water
for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and
troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the
water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had
and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and
eight years
when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time
in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole   the
impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is
troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another
steppeth down before me
jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk
and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and
walked and on the same day was the sabbath
the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the
sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed
he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me
take up thy bed and walk
then asked they him what man is that which said unto thee take
up thy bed and walk   and he that was healed wist not who it
was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that
place
afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him
behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto
thee
the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had
made him whole
and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay
him because he had done these things on the sabbath day
but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work
therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not
only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father
making himself equal with god
then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say
unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the
father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son
likewise
for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things that
himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that ye
may marvel
for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even
so the son quickeneth whom he will
for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment
unto the son  that all men should honour the son even as they
honour the father
he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent
him
verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and
believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not
come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life
verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is
when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that
hear shall live
for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the
son to have life in himself  and hath given him authority to
execute judgment also because he is the son of man
marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that
are in the graves shall hear his voice  and shall come forth
they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that
have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation
i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my
judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of
the father which hath sent me
if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true
there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the
witness which he witnesseth of me is true
ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth
but i receive not testimony from man but these things i say
that ye might be saved
he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a
season to rejoice in his light
but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which
the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear
witness of me that the father hath sent me
and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of
me
ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape
and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent
him ye believe not
search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life
and they are they which testify of me
and ye will not come to me that ye might have life
i receive not honour from men
but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you
i am come in my fathers name and ye receive me not if another
shall come in his own name him ye will receive
how can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek
not the honour that cometh from god only   do not think that i
will accuse you to the father there is one that accuseth you even
moses in whom ye trust
for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he
wrote of me
but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my
words   after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee
which is the sea of tiberias
and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles
which he did on them that were diseased
and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his
disciples
and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh
when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come
unto him he saith unto philip whence shall we buy bread that these
may eat   and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what
he would do
philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little
one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother saith unto
him  there is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and two
small fishes but what are they among so many   and jesus said
make the men sit down now there was much grass in the place so the
men sat down in number about five thousand
and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he
distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set
down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would
when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the
fragments that remain that nothing be lost
therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets
with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and
above unto them that had eaten
then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did
said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world
when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him
by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain
himself alone
and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea
and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum
and it was now dark and jesus was not come to them
and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew
so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs
they see jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and
they were afraid
but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid
then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately
the ship was at the land whither they went
the day following when the people which stood on the other side
of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one
whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his
disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone
howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place
where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks
when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his
disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for
jesus
and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they
said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither   jesus answered
them and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because
ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were
filled
labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which
endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto
you for him hath god the father sealed
then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the
works of god   jesus answered and said unto them this is the
work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent
they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that
we may see and believe thee what dost thou work   our fathers
did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from
heaven to eat
then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses
gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true
bread from heaven
for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and
giveth life unto the world
then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread
and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh
to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never
thirst
but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not
all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that
cometh to me i will in no wise cast out
for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the
will of him that sent me
and this is the fathers will which hath sent me that of all
which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up
again at the last day
and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which
seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i
will raise him up at the last day
the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread
which came down from heaven
and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father
and mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down from
heaven   jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not
among yourselves
no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw
him and i will raise him up at the last day
it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of
god
every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father
cometh unto me
not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god
he hath seen the father
verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath
everlasting life
i am that bread of life
your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead
this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may
eat thereof and not die
i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat
of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give
is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world
the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this
man give us his flesh to eat   then jesus said unto them verily
verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and
drink his blood ye have no life in you
whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life
and i will raise him up at the last day
for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed
he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me
and i in him
as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so
he that eateth me even he shall live by me
this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your
fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread
shall live for ever
these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum
many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said
this is an hard saying who can hear it   when jesus knew in
himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doth
this offend you   what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend
up where he was before   it is the spirit that quickeneth the
flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are
spirit and they are life
but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from
the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray
him
and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto
me except it were given unto him of my father
from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no
more with him
then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away   then
simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the
words of eternal life
and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of
the living god
jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you
is a devil   he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he
it was that should betray him being one of the twelve
after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk
in jewry because the jews sought to kill him
now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand
his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into
judaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest
for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself
seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things shew thyself to
the world
for neither did his brethren believe in him
then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time
is alway ready
the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of
it that the works thereof are evil
go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my
time is not yet full come
when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee
but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the
feast not openly but as it were in secret
then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he
and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for
some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the
people
howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews
now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple
and taught
and the jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters
having never learned   jesus answered them and said my doctrine
is not mine but his that sent me
if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine
whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself
he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that
seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no
unrighteousness is in him
did not moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the
law  why go ye about to kill me   the people answered and said
thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee   jesus answered
and said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel
moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of
moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a
man
if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of
moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made a
man every whit whole on the sabbath day   judge not according to
the appearance but judge righteous judgment
then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom they
seek to kill   but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing
unto him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ
howbeit we know this man whence he is but when christ cometh no
man knoweth whence he is
then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both know
me and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that
sent me is true whom ye know not
but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me
then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him
because his hour was not yet come
and many of the people believed on him and said when christ
cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done
the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things
concerning him and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers
to take him
then said jesus unto them yet a little while am i with you and
then i go unto him that sent me
ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither
ye cannot come
then said the jews among themselves whither will he go that we
shall not find him will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles
and teach the gentiles   what manner of saying is this that he
said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither
ye cannot come   in the last day that great day of the feast
jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto
me and drink
he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his
belly shall flow rivers of living water
but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him
should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that
jesus was not yet glorified   many of the people therefore when
they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet
others said this is the christ but some said shall christ come
out of galilee   hath not the scripture said that christ cometh
of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david
was   so there was a division among the people because of him
and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on
him
then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees and
they said unto them why have ye not brought him   the officers
answered never man spake like this man
then answered them the pharisees are ye also deceived
have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him   but
this people who knoweth not the law are cursed
nicodemus saith unto them he that came to jesus by night being
one of them  doth our law judge any man before it hear him and
know what he doeth   they answered and said unto him art thou
also of galilee  search and look for out of galilee ariseth no
prophet
and every man went unto his own house
jesus went unto the mount of olives
and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all
the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them
and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in
adultery and when they had set her in the midst  they say unto
him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act
now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but
what sayest thou   this they said tempting him that they might
have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote
on the ground as though he heard them not
so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said
unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a
stone at her
and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground
and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience
went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and
jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst
when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he
said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man
condemned thee   she said no man lord and jesus said unto her
neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more
then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the
world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have
the light of life
the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of
thyself thy record is not true
jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of
myself yet my record is true for i know whence i came and whither i
go but ye cannot tell whence i come and whither i go
ye judge after the flesh i judge no man
and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but
i and the father that sent me
it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is
true
i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me
beareth witness of me
then said they unto him where is thy father jesus answered ye
neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have
known my father also
these words spake jesus in the treasury as he taught in the
temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come
then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek
me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come
then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith
whither i go ye cannot come
and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye
are of this world i am not of this world
i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if
ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins
then said they unto him who art thou and jesus saith unto them
even the same that i said unto you from the beginning
i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent
me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard
of him
they understood not that he spake to them of the father
then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man
then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but
as my father hath taught me i speak these things
and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me
alone for i do always those things that please him
as he spake these words many believed on him
then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye
continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed  and ye
shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
they answered him we be abrahams seed and were never in
bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free
jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever
committeth sin is the servant of sin
and the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son
abideth ever
if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free
indeed
i know that ye are abrahams seed but ye seek to kill me
because my word hath no place in you
i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that
which ye have seen with your father
they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus
saith unto them if ye were abrahams children ye would do the works
of abraham
but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth
which i have heard of god this did not abraham
ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not
born of fornication we have one father even god
jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me
for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but
he sent me
why do ye not understand my speech even because ye cannot hear
my word
ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye
will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the
truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he
speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it
and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not
which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth why do
ye not believe me   he that is of god heareth gods words ye
therefore hear them not because ye are not of god
then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that
thou art a samaritan and hast a devil   jesus answered i have
not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me
and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and
judgeth
verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall
never see death
then said the jews unto him now we know that thou hast a devil
abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my
saying he shall never taste of death
art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead and the
prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself   jesus answered if
i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth
me of whom ye say that he is your god  yet ye have not known
him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a
liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying
your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and
was glad
then said the jews unto him thou art not yet fifty years old
and hast thou seen abraham   jesus said unto them verily
verily i say unto you before abraham was i am
then took they up stones to cast at him but jesus hid himself
and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so
passed by
and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his
birth
and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this
man or his parents that he was born blind   jesus answered
neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of
god should be made manifest in him
i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the
night cometh when no man can work
as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world
when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of
the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay
and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by
interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came
seeing
the neighbours therefore and they which before had seen him that
he was blind said is not this he that sat and begged   some
said this is he others said he is like him but he said i am he
therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened
he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay and
anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and
wash and i went and washed and i received sight
then said they unto him where is he he said i know not
they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind
and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened
his eyes
then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his
sight he said unto them he put clay upon mine eyes and i washed
and do see
therefore said some of the pharisees this man is not of god
because he keepeth not the sabbath day others said how can a man
that is a sinner do such miracles and there was a division among
them
they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that
he hath opened thine eyes he said he is a prophet
but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been
blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him
that had received his sight
and they asked them saying is this your son who ye say was
born blind how then doth he now see   his parents answered them
and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind
but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened
his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for
himself
these words spake his parents because they feared the jews for
the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was
christ he should be put out of the synagogue
therefore said his parents he is of age ask him
then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him
give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner
he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not
one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see
then said they to him again what did he to thee how opened he
thine eyes   he answered them i have told you already and ye
did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again will ye also be his
disciples   then they reviled him and said thou art his
disciple but we are moses disciples
we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know
not from whence he is
the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellous
thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine
eyes
now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a
worshipper of god and doeth his will him he heareth
since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the
eyes of one that was born blind
if this man were not of god he could do nothing
they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born in
sins and dost thou teach us and they cast him out
jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found
him he said unto him dost thou believe on the son of god   he
answered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him
and jesus said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that
talketh with thee
and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him
and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they
which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind
and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words
and said unto him are we blind also   jesus said unto them if
ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see
therefore your sin remaineth
verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door
into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a
thief and a robber
but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep
to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he
calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out
and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them
and the sheep follow him for they know his voice
and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for
they know not the voice of strangers
this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what
things they were which he spake unto them
then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you
i am the door of the sheep
all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the
sheep did not hear them
i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and
shall go in and out and find pasture
the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to
destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have
it more abundantly
i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for
the sheep
but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the
sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and
fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep
the hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth not
for the sheep
i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine
as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay
down my life for the sheep
and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i
must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold
and one shepherd
therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life
that i might take it again
no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have
power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this
commandment have i received of my father
there was a division therefore again among the jews for these
sayings
and many of them said he hath a devil and is mad why hear ye
him   others said these are not the words of him that hath a
devil can a devil open the eyes of the blind   and it was at
jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winter
and jesus walked in the temple in solomons porch
then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long
dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly
jesus answered them i told you and ye believed not the works
that i do in my fathers name they bear witness of me
but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said
unto you
my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish
neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand
my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man
is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand
i and my father are one
then the jews took up stones again to stone him
jesus answered them many good works have i shewed you from my
father for which of those works do ye stone me   the jews
answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for
blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god
jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said ye
are gods   if he called them gods unto whom the word of god
came and the scripture cannot be broken  say ye of him whom
the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest
because i said i am the son of god   if i do not the works of
my father believe me not
but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works that
ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him
therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of
their hand  and went away again beyond jordan into the place
where john at first baptized and there he abode
and many resorted unto him and said john did no miracle but
all things that john spake of this man were true
and many believed on him there
now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town
of mary and her sister martha
it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and
wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick
therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom
thou lovest is sick
when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death
but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified
thereby
now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus
when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days
still in the same place where he was
then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judaea
again
his disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought to
stone thee and goest thou thither again   jesus answered are
there not twelve hours in the day if any man walk in the day he
stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world
but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is
no light in him
these things said he and after that he saith unto them our
friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep
then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well
howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had
spoken of taking of rest in sleep
then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead
and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent
ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him
then said thomas which is called didymus unto his
fellowdisciples let us also go that we may die with him
then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave
four days already
now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off
and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them
concerning their brother
then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went
and met him but mary sat still in the house
then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here my
brother had not died
but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god
will give it thee
jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again
martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the
resurrection at the last day
jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he
that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest
thou this   she saith unto him yea lord i believe that thou
art the christ the son of god which should come into the world
and when she had so said she went her way and called mary her
sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee
as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him
now jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place
where martha met him
the jews then which were with her in the house and comforted
her when they saw mary that she rose up hastily and went out
followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there
then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell
down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my
brother had not died
when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping
which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled
and said where have ye laid him they said unto him lord come
and see
jesus wept
then said the jews behold how he loved him   and some of
them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind
have caused that even this man should not have died   jesus
therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was a
cave and a stone lay upon it
jesus said take ye away the stone martha the sister of him
that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he
hath been dead four days
jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou
wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god   then
they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and
jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou
hast heard me
and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the
people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast
sent me
and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice
lazarus come forth
and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with
graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus saith
unto them loose him and let him go
then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the
things which jesus did believed on him
but some of them went their ways to the pharisees and told them
what things jesus had done
then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and
said what do we for this man doeth many miracles
if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the
romans shall come and take away both our place and nation
and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same
year said unto them ye know nothing at all  nor consider that
it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and
that the whole nation perish not
and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that
year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation  and
not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in
one the children of god that were scattered abroad
then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put
him to death
jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went
thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called
ephraim and there continued with his disciples
and the jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out of
the country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves
then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as they
stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the
feast   now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a
commandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew it
that they might take him
then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany where
lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead
there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was
one of them that sat at the table with him
then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and
anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the
house was filled with the odour of the ointment
then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot simons son
which should betray him  why was not this ointment sold for three
hundred pence and given to the poor   this he said not that he
cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and
bare what was put therein
then said jesus let her alone against the day of my burying
hath she kept this
for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always
much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there and
they came not for jesus sake only but that they might see lazarus
also whom he had raised from the dead
but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also
to death  because that by reason of him many of the jews went
away and believed on jesus
on the next day much people that were come to the feast when
they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem  took branches of
palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosanna blessed is
the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord
and jesus when he had found a young ass sat thereon as it is
written  fear not daughter of sion behold thy king cometh
sitting on an asss colt
these things understood not his disciples at the first but when
jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were
written of him and that they had done these things unto him
the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus
out of his grave and raised him from the dead bare record
for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that
he had done this miracle
the pharisees therefore said among themselves perceive ye how
ye prevail nothing behold the world is gone after him
and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship
at the feast  the same came therefore to philip which was of
bethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see
jesus
philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip
tell jesus
and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son
of man should be glorified
verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into
the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth
much fruit
he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his
life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal
if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there
shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father
honour
now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me
from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour
father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven
saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again
the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it
thundered others said an angel spake to him
jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but
for your sakes
now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this
world be cast out
and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto
me
this he said signifying what death he should die
the people answered him we have heard out of the law that
christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be
lifted up who is this son of man   then jesus said unto them
yet a little while is the light with you
walk while ye have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that
walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth
while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the
children of light these things spake jesus and departed and did
hide himself from them
but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they
believed not on him  that the saying of esaias the prophet might
be fulfilled which he spake lord who hath believed our report and
to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed   therefore they
could not believe because that esaias said again  he hath
blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see
with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted
and i should heal them
these things said esaias when he saw his glory and spake of
him
nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him
but because of the pharisees they did not confess him lest they
should be put out of the synagogue  for they loved the praise of
men more than the praise of god
jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on
me but on him that sent me
and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me
i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me
should not abide in darkness
and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not
for i came not to judge the world but to save the world
he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that
judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in
the last day
for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me
he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak
and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever
i speak therefore even as the father said unto me so i speak
now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his
hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father
having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the
end
and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart
of judas iscariot simons son to betray him  jesus knowing that
the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come
from god and went to god  he riseth from supper and laid aside
his garments and took a towel and girded himself
after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the
disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was
girded
then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord
dost thou wash my feet   jesus answered and said unto him what i
do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter
peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus
answered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me
simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my
hands and my head
jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash
his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all
for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not
all clean
so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments
and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to
you   ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am
if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also
ought to wash one anothers feet
for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have
done to you
verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than
his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him
if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them
i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the
scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted
up his heel against me
now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye
may believe that i am he
verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i
send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent
me
when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and
testified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of you
shall betray me
then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he
spake
now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom
jesus loved
simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it
should be of whom he spake
he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it
jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i
have dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas
iscariot the son of simon
and after the sop satan entered into him then said jesus unto
him that thou doest do quickly
now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto
him
for some of them thought because judas had the bag that jesus
had said unto him buy those things that we have need of against the
feast or that he should give something to the poor
he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was
night
therefore when he was gone out jesus said now is the son of
man glorified and god is glorified in him
if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in
himself and shall straightway glorify him
little children yet a little while i am with you ye shall seek
me and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so now
i say to you
a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as
i have loved you that ye also love one another
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have
love one to another
simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou jesus
answered him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou
shalt follow me afterwards
peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now i will
lay down my life for thy sake
jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake
verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou
hast denied me thrice
let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also
in me
in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i
would have told you i go to prepare a place for you
and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and
receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also
and whither i go ye know and the way ye know
thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and
how can we know the way   jesus saith unto him i am the way the
truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from
henceforth ye know him and have seen him
philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth
us
jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet
hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the
father and how sayest thou then shew us the father   believest
thou not that i am in the father and the father in me  the words
that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that
dwelleth in me he doeth the works
believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or
else believe me for the very works sake
verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the
works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall
he do because i go unto my father
and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the
father may be glorified in the son
if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do it
if ye love me keep my commandments
and i will pray the father and he shall give you another
comforter that he may abide with you for ever  even the spirit
of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not
neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and
shall be in you
i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you
yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see
me because i live ye shall live also
at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me
and i in you
he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that
loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i
will love him and will manifest myself to him
judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou
wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world   jesus
answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words
and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our
abode with him
he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which
ye hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me
these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you
but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will
send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things
to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you
peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the
world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither
let it be afraid
ye have heard how i said unto you i go away and come again
unto you if ye loved me ye would rejoice because i said i go unto
the father for my father is greater than i
and now i have told you before it come to pass that when it is
come to pass ye might believe
hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this
world cometh and hath nothing in me
but that the world may know that i love the father and as the
father gave me commandment even so i do arise let us go hence
i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman
every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and
every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring
forth more fruit
now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you
abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide
in me
i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i
in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do
nothing
if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is
withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they
are burned
if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what
ye will and it shall be done unto you
herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall
ye be my disciples
as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in
my love
if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i
have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love
these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in
you and that your joy might be full
this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have
loved you
greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life
for his friends
ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you
henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things
that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you
ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you
that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should
remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may
give it you
these things i command you that ye love one another
if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated
you
if ye were of the world the world would love his own but
because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the
world therefore the world hateth you
remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not
greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also
persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also
but all these things will they do unto you for my names sake
because they know not him that sent me
if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin
but now they have no cloak for their sin
he that hateth me hateth my father also
if i had not done among them the works which none other man did
they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me
and my father
but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that
is written in their law they hated me without a cause
but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from
the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the
father he shall testify of me  and ye also shall bear witness
because ye have been with me from the beginning
these things have i spoken unto you that ye should not be
offended
they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh
that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service
and these things will they do unto you because they have not
known the father nor me
but these things have i told you that when the time shall come
ye may remember that i told you of them and these things i said not
unto you at the beginning because i was with you
but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh
me whither goest thou   but because i have said these things
unto you sorrow hath filled your heart
nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i
go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you
but if i depart i will send him unto you
and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of
righteousness and of judgment  of sin because they believe not
on me  of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see
me no more  of judgment because the prince of this world is
judged
i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them
now
howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you
into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he
shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come
he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall
shew it unto you
all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that
he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you
a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little
while and ye shall see me because i go to the father
then said some of his disciples among themselves what is this
that he saith unto us a little while and ye shall not see me and
again a little while and ye shall see me and because i go to the
father   they said therefore what is this that he saith a
little while we cannot tell what he saith
now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto
them do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said a little while
and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see
me   verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and
lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but
your sorrow shall be turned into joy
a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is
come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no
more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world
and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and
your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily i say
unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give
it you
hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall
receive that your joy may be full
these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but the time
cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall
shew you plainly of the father
at that day ye shall ask in my name and i say not unto you
that i will pray the father for you  for the father himself
loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that i came
out from god
i came forth from the father and am come into the world again
i leave the world and go to the father
his disciples said unto him lo now speakest thou plainly and
speakest no proverb
now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest not
that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest
forth from god
jesus answered them do ye now believe   behold the hour
cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his
own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the
father is with me
these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have
peace
in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have
overcome the world
these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and
said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may
glorify thee  as thou hast given him power over all flesh that
he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him
and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true
god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent
i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work
which thou gavest me to do
and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the
glory which i had with thee before the world was
i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out
of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have
kept thy word
now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me
are of thee
for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and
they have received them and have known surely that i came out from
thee and they have believed that thou didst send me
i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which
thou hast given me for they are thine
and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified
in them
and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world
and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those
whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are
while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name
those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but
the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled
and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world
that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves
i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them
because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world
i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but
that thou shouldest keep them from the evil
they are not of the world even as i am not of the world
sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth
as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent
them into the world
and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be
sanctified through the truth
neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall
believe on me through their word  that they all may be one as
thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in
us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me
and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they
may be one even as we are one  i in them and thou in me that
they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou
hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me
father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with
me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given
me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world
o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have
known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me
and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it
that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and i in
them
when jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his
disciples over the brook cedron where was a garden into the which he
entered and his disciples
and judas also which betrayed him knew the place for jesus
ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples
judas then having received a band of men and officers from the
chief priests and pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches
and weapons
jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him
went forth and said unto them whom seek ye   they answered him
jesus of nazareth jesus saith unto them i am he
and judas also which betrayed him stood with them
as soon then as he had said unto them i am he they went
backward and fell to the ground
then asked he them again whom seek ye and they said jesus of
nazareth
jesus answered i have told you that i am he if therefore ye
seek me let these go their way  that the saying might be
fulfilled which he spake of them which thou gavest me have i lost
none
then simon peter having a sword drew it and smote the high
priests servant and cut off his right ear the servants name was
malchus
then said jesus unto peter put up thy sword into the sheath
the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it
then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus and
bound him  and led him away to annas first for he was father in
law to caiaphas which was the high priest that same year
now caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the jews that it was
expedient that one man should die for the people
and simon peter followed jesus and so did another disciple
that disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with jesus
into the palace of the high priest
but peter stood at the door without then went out that other
disciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto her
that kept the door and brought in peter
then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter art not
thou also one of this mans disciples he saith i am not
and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire
of coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and peter stood
with them and warmed himself
the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples and of his
doctrine
jesus answered him i spake openly to the world i ever taught
in the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resort
and in secret have i said nothing
why askest thou me ask them which heard me what i have said
unto them behold they know what i said
and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by
struck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou the
high priest so   jesus answered him if i have spoken evil bear
witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me   now
annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest
and simon peter stood and warmed himself they said therefore
unto him art not thou also one of his disciples he denied it and
said i am not
one of the servants of the high priest being his kinsman whose
ear peter cut off saith did not i see thee in the garden with him
peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew
then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment and
it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment hall
lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the passover
pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bring
ye against this man   they answered and said unto him if he
were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee
then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according
to your law the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us
to put any man to death  that the saying of jesus might be
fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die
then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called
jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews   jesus
answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it
thee of me   pilate answered am i a jew thine own nation and
the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done
jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom
were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be
delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence
pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus
answered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and
for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto
the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice
pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said this
he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him no
fault at all
but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the
passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the
jews   then cried they all again saying not this man but
barabbas now barabbas was a robber
then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him
and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his
head and they put on him a purple robe  and said hail king of
the jews and they smote him with their hands
pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold i
bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him
then came jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the
purple robe and pilate saith unto them behold the man   when
the chief priests therefore and officers saw him they cried out
saying crucify him crucify him pilate saith unto them take ye him
and crucify him for i find no fault in him
the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought to
die because he made himself the son of god
when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid
and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus
whence art thou but jesus gave him no answer
then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest
thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release
thee   jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all
against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that
delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin
and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews
cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesars
friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar
when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth
and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the
pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha
and it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth
hour and he saith unto the jews behold your king   but they
cried out away with him away with him crucify him
pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king the chief priests
answered we have no king but caesar
then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified and
they took jesus and led him away
and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the
place of a skull which is called in the hebrew golgotha  where
they crucified him and two other with him on either side one and
jesus in the midst
and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross and the
writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews
this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus
was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew and
greek and latin
then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate write not
the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews
pilate answered what i have written i have written
then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his
garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his
coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout
they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but
cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be
fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my
vesture they did cast lots these things therefore the soldiers did
now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his
mothers sister mary the wife of cleophas and mary magdalene
when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing
by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son
then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that
hour that disciple took her unto his own home
after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished
that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst
now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a
spunge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth
when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is
finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost
the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the
bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that
sabbath day was an high day besought pilate that their legs might be
broken and that they might be taken away
then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of
the other which was crucified with him
but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already
they brake not his legs  but one of the soldiers with a spear
pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water
and he that saw it bare record and his record is true and he
knoweth that he saith true that ye might believe
for these things were done that the scripture should be
fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken
and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom
they pierced
and after this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus
but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might take
away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave he came therefore
and took the body of jesus
and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus
by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred
pound weight
then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clothes
with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury
now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and
in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid
there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation
day for the sepulchre was nigh at hand
the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it
was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from
the sepulchre
then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other
disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away
the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid
him
peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to
the sepulchre
so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun
peter and came first to the sepulchre
and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes
lying yet went he not in
then cometh simon peter following him and went into the
sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie  and the napkin that
was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped
together in a place by itself
then went in also that other disciple which came first to the
sepulchre and he saw and believed
for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again
from the dead
then the disciples went away again unto their own home
but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she
wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre  and seeth
two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the
feet where the body of jesus had lain
and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto
them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they
have laid him
and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw
jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus
jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest
thou  she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if
thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i
will take him away
jesus saith unto her mary she turned herself and saith unto
him rabboni which is to say master
jesus saith unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to
my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my
father and your father and to my god and your god
mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the
lord and that he had spoken these things unto her
then the same day at evening being the first day of the week
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear
of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them
peace be unto you
and when he had so said he shewed unto them his hands and his
side
then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord
then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father
hath sent me even so send i you
and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto
them receive ye the holy ghost  whose soever sins ye remit
they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are
retained
but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them
when jesus came
the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the
lord
but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of
the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust
my hand into his side i will not believe
and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas
with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the
midst and said peace be unto you
then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my
hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be
not faithless but believing
and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god
jesus saith unto him thomas because thou hast seen me thou
hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have
believed
and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his
disciples which are not written in this book  but these are
written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of
god and that believing ye might have life through his name
after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at
the sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he himself
there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and
nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other
of his disciples
simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing they say unto him
we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship
immediately and that night they caught nothing
but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but
the disciples knew not that it was jesus
then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat they
answered him no
and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the
ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not
able to draw it for the multitude of fishes
therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is
the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his
fishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into
the sea
and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not
far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net
with fishes
as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals
there and fish laid thereon and bread
jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now
caught
simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great
fishes an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so
many yet was not the net broken
jesus saith unto them come and dine and none of the disciples
durst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord
jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish
likewise
this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his
disciples after that he was risen from the dead
so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son
of jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yea
lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my lambs
he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas
lovest thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love
thee he saith unto him feed my sheep
he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest
thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time
lovest thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things
thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep
verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou
girdest thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou
shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall
gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not
this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god
and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me
then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved
following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord
which is he that betrayeth thee   peter seeing him saith to
jesus lord and what shall this man do   jesus saith unto him
if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou
me
then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that
disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not
die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee
this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote
these things and we know that his testimony is true
and there are also many other things which jesus did the which
if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world
itself could not contain the books that should be written amen
the acts of the apostles
the former treatise have i made o theophilus of all that jesus
began both to do and teach  until the day in which he was taken
up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto
the apostles whom he had chosen  to whom also he shewed himself
alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them
forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of
god  and being assembled together with them commanded them that
they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the
father which saith he ye have heard of me
for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with
the holy ghost not many days hence
when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying
lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel
and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the
seasons which the father hath put in his own power
but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon
you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all
judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth
and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was
taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight
and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up
behold two men stood by them in white apparel  which also said
ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same
jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like
manner as ye have seen him go into heaven
then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet
which is from jerusalem a sabbath days journey
and when they were come in they went up into an upper room
where abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and
thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon
zelotes and judas the brother of james
these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication
with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren
and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
and said the number of names together were about an hundred and
twenty  men and brethren this scripture must needs have been
fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before
concerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus
for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this
ministry
now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and
falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels
gushed out
and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem insomuch as
that field is called in their proper tongue aceldama that is to say
the field of blood
for it is written in the book of psalms let his habitation be
desolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick let another
take
wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time
that the lord jesus went in and out among us  beginning from the
baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must
one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection
and they appointed two joseph called barsabas who was surnamed
justus and matthias
and they prayed and said thou lord which knowest the hearts
of all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen  that he
may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which judas by
transgression fell that he might go to his own place
and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon matthias
and he was numbered with the eleven apostles
and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with
one accord in one place
and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting
and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and
it sat upon each of them
and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak
with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of
every nation under heaven
now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and
were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own
language
and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another
behold are not all these which speak galilaeans   and how hear we
every man in our own tongue wherein we were born   parthians and
medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaea
and cappadocia in pontus and asia  phrygia and pamphylia in
egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome
jews and proselytes  cretes and arabians we do hear them speak
in our tongues the wonderful works of god
and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to
another what meaneth this   others mocking said these men are
full of new wine
but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and
said unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem
be this known unto you and hearken to my words  for these are
not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the
day
but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel  and
it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of
my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall
prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall
dream dreams  and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will
pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy  and
i will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath
blood and fire and vapour of smoke  the sun shall be turned
into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable
day of the lord come  and it shall come to pass that whosoever
shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man
approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god
did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know  him
being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god
ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain  whom
god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was
not possible that he should be holden of it
for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord always
before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be
moved  therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad
moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope  because thou wilt not
leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see
corruption
thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me
full of joy with thy countenance
men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us
unto this day
therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an
oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh
he would raise up christ to sit on his throne  he seeing this
before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left
in hell neither his flesh did see corruption
this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses
therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having
received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed
forth this which ye now see and hear
for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself
the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand  until i
make thy foes thy footstool
therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god
hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and
christ
now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and
said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren
what shall we do   then peter said unto them repent and be
baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the
remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all
that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call
and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save
yourselves from this untoward generation
then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the
same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls
and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and
fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers
and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were
done by the apostles
and all that believed were together and had all things common
and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men
as every man had need
and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and
breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness
and singleness of heart  praising god and having favour with all
the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be
saved
now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of
prayer being the ninth hour
and a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried whom
they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful
to ask alms of them that entered into the temple  who seeing peter
and john about to go into the temple asked an alms
and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on
us
and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of
them
then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have
give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk
and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and
immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength
and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into
the temple walking and leaping and praising god
and all the people saw him walking and praising god  and they
knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the
temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which
had happened unto him
and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john all the
people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomons
greatly wondering
and when peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of
israel why marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us as
though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk
the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our
fathers hath glorified his son jesus whom ye delivered up and
denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let
him go
but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer
to be granted unto you  and killed the prince of life whom god
hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses
and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong
whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him
this perfect soundness in the presence of you all
and now brethren i wot that through ignorance ye did it as did
also your rulers
but those things which god before had shewed by the mouth of all
his prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled
repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be
blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence
of the lord
and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto
you  whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution
of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy
prophets since the world began
for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord
your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall
ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you
and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear
that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people
yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow
after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days
ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which
god made with our fathers saying unto abraham and in thy seed shall
all the kindreds of the earth be blessed
unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to
bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities
and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of
the temple and the sadducees came upon them  being grieved that
they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection
from the dead
and they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next
day for it was now eventide
howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number
of the men was about five thousand
and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders
and scribes  and annas the high priest and caiaphas and john
and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest
were gathered together at jerusalem
and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what
power or by what name have ye done this   then peter filled
with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and
elders of israel  if we this day be examined of the good deed done
to the impotent man by what means he is made whole  be it known
unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of
jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the
dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole
this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which
is become the head of the corner
neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other
name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived
that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they
took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus
and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they
could say nothing against it
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council
they conferred among themselves  saying what shall we do to
these men for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is
manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it
but that it spread no further among the people let us straitly
threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name
and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor
teach in the name of jesus
but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be
right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god
judge ye
for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard
so when they had further threatened them they let them go
finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for
all men glorified god for that which was done
for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of
healing was shewed
and being let go they went to their own company and reported
all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them
and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with
one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and
earth and the sea and all that in them is  who by the mouth of
thy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the people
imagine vain things   the kings of the earth stood up and the
rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his
christ
for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast
anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the
people of israel were gathered together  for to do whatsoever
thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done
and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy
servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word  by
stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be
done by the name of thy holy child jesus
and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were
assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and
they spake the word of god with boldness
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of
one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he
possessed was his own but they had all things common
and with great power gave the apostles witness of the
resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all
neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were
possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the
things that were sold  and laid them down at the apostles feet
and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need
and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is
being interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the
country of cyprus  having land sold it and brought the money
and laid it at the apostles feet
but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a
possession  and kept back part of the price his wife also being
privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles
feet
but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie
to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land
whiles it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold
was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in
thine heart  thou hast not lied unto men but unto god
and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost
and great fear came on all them that heard these things
and the young men arose wound him up and carried him out and
buried him
and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife
not knowing what was done came in
and peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for
so much and she said yea for so much
then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together
to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which have
buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out
then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up the
ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carrying
her forth buried her by her husband
and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as
heard these things
and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in
solomons porch
and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the people
magnified them
and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of
men and women   insomuch that they brought forth the sick into
the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the
shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them
there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean
spirits and they were healed every one
then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him
which is the sect of the sadducees and were filled with
indignation  and laid their hands on the apostles and put them
in the common prison
but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and
brought them forth and said  go stand and speak in the temple
to the people all the words of this life
and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in
the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were
with him and called the council together and all the senate of the
children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought
but when the officers came and found them not in the prison
they returned and told  saying the prison truly found we shut
with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors
but when we had opened we found no man within
now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the
chief priests heard these things they doubted of them whereunto this
would grow
then came one and told them saying behold the men whom ye put
in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people
then went the captain with the officers and brought them without
violence for they feared the people lest they should have been
stoned
and when they had brought them they set them before the council
and the high priest asked them  saying did not we straitly
command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold ye
have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this
mans blood upon us
then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to
obey god rather than men
the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged
on a tree
him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a
saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy
ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him
when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took
counsel to slay them
then stood there up one in the council a pharisee named
gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people
and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space  and said
unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to
do as touching these men
for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to be
somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined
themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were
scattered and brought to nought
after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the
taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and
all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed
and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them
alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to
nought  but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest haply
ye be found even to fight against god
and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles
and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name
of jesus and let them go
and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name
and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to
teach and preach jesus christ
and in those days when the number of the disciples was
multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the
hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily
ministration
then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them
and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and
serve tables
wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest
report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over
this business
but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the
ministry of the word
and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose
stephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip and
prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas a
proselyte of antioch  whom they set before the apostles and when
they had prayed they laid their hands on them
and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples
multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests
were obedient to the faith
and stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and
miracles among the people
then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the
synagogue of the libertines and cyrenians and alexandrians and of
them of cilicia and of asia disputing with stephen
and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by
which he spake
then they suborned men which said we have heard him speak
blasphemous words against moses and against god
and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes
and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council
and set up false witnesses which said this man ceaseth not to
speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law  for
we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this
place and shall change the customs which moses delivered us
and all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him saw
his face as it had been the face of an angel
then said the high priest are these things so   and he said
men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto
our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in
charran  and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from
thy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee
then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt in
charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him
into this land wherein ye now dwell
and he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set
his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a
possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child
and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a
strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and
entreat them evil four hundred years
and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge said
god and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place
and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham begat
isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob and
jacob begat the twelve patriarchs
and the patriarchs moved with envy sold joseph into egypt but
god was with him  and delivered him out of all his afflictions
and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt
and he made him governor over egypt and all his house
now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan
and great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance
but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt he sent out
our fathers first
and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren and
josephs kindred was made known unto pharaoh
then sent joseph and called his father jacob to him and all his
kindred threescore and fifteen souls
so jacob went down into egypt and died he and our fathers
and were carried over into sychem and laid in the sepulchre that
abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor the father of
sychem
but when the time of the promise drew nigh which god had sworn
to abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt  till another
king arose which knew not joseph
the same dealt subtilly with our kindred and evil entreated our
fathers so that they cast out their young children to the end they
might not live
in which time moses was born and was exceeding fair and
nourished up in his fathers house three months  and when he was
cast out pharaohs daughter took him up and nourished him for her
own son
and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was
mighty in words and in deeds
and when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to
visit his brethren the children of israel
and seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged
him that was oppressed and smote the egyptian  for he supposed
his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would
deliver them but they understood not
and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove and
would have set them at one again saying sirs ye are brethren why
do ye wrong one to another   but he that did his neighbour wrong
thrust him away saying who made thee a ruler and a judge over us
wilt thou kill me as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday
then fled moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of
madian where he begat two sons
and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the
wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a
bush
when moses saw it he wondered at the sight and as he drew near
to behold it the voice of the lord came unto him  saying i am
the god of thy fathers the god of abraham and the god of isaac and
the god of jacob then moses trembled and durst not behold
then said the lord to him put off thy shoes from thy feet for
the place where thou standest is holy ground
i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people which is in
egypt and i have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver
them and now come i will send thee into egypt
this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a
judge the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand
of the angel which appeared to him in the bush
he brought them out after that he had shewed wonders and signs
in the land of egypt and in the red sea and in the wilderness forty
years
this is that moses which said unto the children of israel a
prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren
like unto me him shall ye hear
this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the
angel which spake to him in the mount sina and with our fathers who
received the lively oracles to give unto us  to whom our fathers
would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned
back again into egypt  saying unto aaron make us gods to go
before us for as for this moses which brought us out of the land of
egypt we wot not what is become of him
and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice unto
the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands
then god turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven
as it is written in the book of the prophets o ye house of israel
have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of
forty years in the wilderness   yea ye took up the tabernacle of
moloch and the star of your god remphan figures which ye made to
worship them and i will carry you away beyond babylon
our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as
he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it
according to the fashion that he had seen
which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into
the possession of the gentiles whom god drave out before the face of
our fathers unto the days of david  who found favour before god
and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob
but solomon built him an house
howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as
saith the prophet  heaven is my throne and earth is my
footstool what house will ye build me saith the lord or what is the
place of my rest   hath not my hand made all these things
ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always
resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye
which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they
have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one of
whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers  who have
received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it
when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and
they gnashed on him with their teeth
but he being full of the holy ghost looked up stedfastly into
heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand
of god  and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son
of man standing on the right hand of god
then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears
and ran upon him with one accord  and cast him out of the city
and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young
mans feet whose name was saul
and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord
jesus receive my spirit
and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not
this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep
and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was
a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and
they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and
samaria except the apostles
and devout men carried stephen to his burial and made great
lamentation over him
as for saul he made havock of the church entering into every
house and haling men and women committed them to prison
therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
preaching the word
then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ
unto them
and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which
philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did
for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that
were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were
lame were healed
and there was great joy in that city
but there was a certain man called simon which beforetime in the
same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving
out that himself was some great one  to whom they all gave heed
from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of
god
and to him they had regard because that of long time he had
bewitched them with sorceries
but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the
kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both
men and women
then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he
continued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs
which were done
now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria
had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john
who when they were come down prayed for them that they might
receive the holy ghost  for as yet he was fallen upon none of
them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus
then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost
and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands
the holy ghost was given he offered them money  saying give me
also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the
holy ghost
but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou
hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money
thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is
not right in the sight of god
repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps
the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee
for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in
the bond of iniquity
then answered simon and said pray ye to the lord for me that
none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me
and they when they had testified and preached the word of the
lord returned to jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages
of the samaritans
and the angel of the lord spake unto philip saying arise and
go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto
gaza which is desert
and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia an eunuch
of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the
charge of all her treasure and had come to jerusalem for to worship
was returning and sitting in his chariot read esaias the
prophet
then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to
this chariot
and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet
esaias and said understandest thou what thou readest   and he
said how can i except some man should guide me and he desired
philip that he would come up and sit with him
the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as
a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his shearer so
opened he not his mouth  in his humiliation his judgment was
taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is
taken from the earth
and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee of whom
speaketh the prophet this of himself or of some other man
then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and
preached unto him jesus
and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water
and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be
baptized   and philip said if thou believest with all thine
heart thou mayest
and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of
god
and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down
both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him
and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the
lord caught away philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went
on his way rejoicing
but philip was found at azotus and passing through he preached
in all the cities till he came to caesarea
and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the
disciples of the lord went unto the high priest  and desired of
him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of
this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound
unto jerusalem
and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there
shined round about him a light from heaven  and he fell to the
earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest
thou me   and he said who art thou lord and the lord said i am
jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the
pricks
and he trembling and astonished said lord what wilt thou have me
to do and the lord said unto him arise and go into the city and it
shall be told thee what thou must do
and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a
voice but seeing no man
and saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he
saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into
damascus
and he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor
drink
and there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and
to him said the lord in a vision ananias and he said behold i am
here lord
and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which
is called straight and enquire in the house of judas for one called
saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth  and hath seen in a
vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him
that he might receive his sight
then ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this man
how much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem  and here
he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy
name
but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel
unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the
children of israel  for i will shew him how great things he must
suffer for my names sake
and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting
his hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus that
appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou
mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost
and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales
and he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized
and when he had received meat he was strengthened then was saul
certain days with the disciples which were at damascus
and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is
the son of god
but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that
destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem and came hither
for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief
priests   but saul increased the more in strength and confounded
the jews which dwelt at damascus proving that this is very christ
and after that many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to
kill him  but their laying await was known of saul and they
watched the gates day and night to kill him
then the disciples took him by night and let him down by the
wall in a basket
and when saul was come to jerusalem he assayed to join himself
to the disciples but they were all afraid of him and believed not
that he was a disciple
but barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and
declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way and that he
had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at damascus in the
name of jesus
and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem
and he spake boldly in the name of the lord jesus and disputed
against the grecians but they went about to slay him
which when the brethren knew they brought him down to caesarea
and sent him forth to tarsus
then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and
samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the lord and in
the comfort of the holy ghost were multiplied
and it came to pass as peter passed throughout all quarters he
came down also to the saints which dwelt at lydda
and there he found a certain man named aeneas which had kept his
bed eight years and was sick of the palsy
and peter said unto him aeneas jesus christ maketh thee whole
arise and make thy bed and he arose immediately
and all that dwelt at lydda and saron saw him and turned to the
lord
now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha which by
interpretation is called dorcas this woman was full of good works and
almsdeeds which she did
and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died
whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber
and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppa and the disciples had
heard that peter was there they sent unto him two men desiring him
that he would not delay to come to them
then peter arose and went with them when he was come they
brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him
weeping and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made while
she was with them
but peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and
turning him to the body said tabitha arise and she opened her eyes
and when she saw peter she sat up
and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had
called the saints and widows presented her alive
and it was known throughout all joppa and many believed in the
lord
and it came to pass that he tarried many days in joppa with one
simon a tanner
there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurion
of the band called the italian band  a devout man and one that
feared god with all his house which gave much alms to the people and
prayed to god alway
he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an
angel of god coming in to him and saying unto him cornelius
and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it
lord  and he said unto him thy prayers and thine alms are come up
for a memorial before god
and now send men to joppa and call for one simon whose surname
is peter  he lodgeth with one simon a tanner whose house is by
the sea side he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do
and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed he
called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them
that waited on him continually  and when he had declared all
these things unto them he sent them to joppa
on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh unto
the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth
hour  and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while
they made ready he fell into a trance  and saw heaven opened
and a certain vessel descending upon him as it had been a great sheet
knit at the four corners and let down to the earth  wherein
were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts
and creeping things and fowls of the air
and there came a voice to him rise peter kill and eat
but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten any thing
that is common or unclean
and the voice spake unto him again the second time what god
hath cleansed that call not thou common
this was done thrice and the vessel was received up again into
heaven
now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had
seen should mean behold the men which were sent from cornelius had
made enquiry for simons house and stood before the gate  and
called and asked whether simon which was surnamed peter were lodged
there
while peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto him
behold three men seek thee
arise therefore and get thee down and go with them doubting
nothing for i have sent them
then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
cornelius and said behold i am he whom ye seek what is the cause
wherefore ye are come   and they said cornelius the centurion
a just man and one that feareth god and of good report among all the
nation of the jews was warned from god by an holy angel to send for
thee into his house and to hear words of thee
then called he them in and lodged them and on the morrow peter
went away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him
and the morrow after they entered into caesarea and cornelius
waited for them and he had called together his kinsmen and near
friends
and as peter was coming in cornelius met him and fell down at
his feet and worshipped him
but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man
and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were
come together
and he said unto them ye know how that it is an unlawful thing
for a man that is a jew to keep company or come unto one of another
nation but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common
or unclean
therefore came i unto you without gainsaying as soon as i was
sent for i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me
and cornelius said four days ago i was fasting until this hour and
at the ninth hour i prayed in my house and behold a man stood
before me in bright clothing  and said cornelius thy prayer is
heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god
send therefore to joppa and call hither simon whose surname is
peter he is lodged in the house of one simon a tanner by the sea
side who when he cometh shall speak unto thee
immediately therefore i sent to thee and thou hast well done
that thou art come now therefore are we all here present before god
to hear all things that are commanded thee of god
then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive
that god is no respecter of persons  but in every nation he that
feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him
the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching
peace by jesus christ he is lord of all  that word i say ye
know which was published throughout all judaea and began from
galilee after the baptism which john preached  how god anointed
jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about
doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god
was with him
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land
of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree
him god raised up the third day and shewed him openly
not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before god even to
us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify
that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick and
dead
to him give all the prophets witness that through his name
whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins
while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all
them which heard the word
and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as
many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured
out the gift of the holy ghost
for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god then
answered peter  can any man forbid water that these should not
be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we
and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord then
prayed they him to tarry certain days
and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the
gentiles had also received the word of god
and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of the
circumcision contended with him  saying thou wentest in to men
uncircumcised and didst eat with them
but peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded
it by order unto them saying  i was in the city of joppa
praying and in a trance i saw a vision a certain vessel descend as
it had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and
it came even to me  upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes
i considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts
and creeping things and fowls of the air
and i heard a voice saying unto me arise peter slay and eat
but i said not so lord for nothing common or unclean hath at
any time entered into my mouth
but the voice answered me again from heaven what god hath
cleansed that call not thou common
and this was done three times and all were drawn up again into
heaven
and behold immediately there were three men already come unto
the house where i was sent from caesarea unto me
and the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting moreover
these six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the mans
house  and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house
which stood and said unto him send men to joppa and call for simon
whose surname is peter  who shall tell thee words whereby thou
and all thy house shall be saved
and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us
at the beginning
then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john
indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy
ghost
forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us
who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could
withstand god   when they heard these things they held their
peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles
granted repentance unto life
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that
arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice and cyprus and
antioch preaching the word to none but unto the jews only
and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene which when they
were come to antioch spake unto the grecians preaching the lord
jesus
and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number
believed and turned unto the lord
then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church
which was in jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas that he should
go as far as antioch
who when he came and had seen the grace of god was glad and
exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto
the lord
for he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faith
and much people was added unto the lord
then departed barnabas to tarsus for to seek saul  and
when he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came to
pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and
taught much people and the disciples were called christians first in
antioch
and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch
and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by
the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world
which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar
then the disciples every man according to his ability
determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea
which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of
barnabas and saul
now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to
vex certain of the church
and he killed james the brother of john with the sword
and because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further to
take peter also then were the days of unleavened bread   and
when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him
to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter to
bring him forth to the people
peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without
ceasing of the church unto god for him
and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter
was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the
keepers before the door kept the prison
and behold the angel of the lord came upon him and a light
shined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised him
up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands
and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy
sandals
and so he did and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and
follow me
and he went out and followed him and wist not that it was true
which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision
when they were past the first and the second ward they came
unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of
his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street
and forthwith the angel departed from him
and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a
surety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out
of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of
the jews
and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of
mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were
gathered together praying
and as peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to
hearken named rhoda
and when she knew peters voice she opened not the gate for
gladness but ran in and told how peter stood before the gate
and they said unto her thou art mad but she constantly
affirmed that it was even so then said they it is his angel
but peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door
and saw him they were astonished
but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace
declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison and
he said go shew these things unto james and to the brethren and he
departed and went into another place
now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the
soldiers what was become of peter
and when herod had sought for him and found him not he
examined the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death
and he went down from judaea to caesarea and there abode
and herod was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon but
they came with one accord to him and having made blastus the kings
chamberlain their friend desired peace because their country was
nourished by the kings country
and upon a set day herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his
throne and made an oration unto them
and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god
and not of a man
and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave
not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost
but the word of god grew and multiplied
and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem when they had
fulfilled their ministry and took with them john whose surname was
mark
now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets
and teachers as barnabas and simeon that was called niger and
lucius of cyrene and manaen which had been brought up with herod the
tetrarch and saul
as they ministered to the lord and fasted the holy ghost said
separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called
them
and when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on
them they sent them away
so they being sent forth by the holy ghost departed unto
seleucia and from thence they sailed to cyprus
and when they were at salamis they preached the word of god in
the synagogues of the jews and they had also john to their minister
and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos they found a
certain sorcerer a false prophet a jew whose name was barjesus
which was with the deputy of the country sergius paulus a
prudent man who called for barnabas and saul and desired to hear the
word of god
but elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation
withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith
then saul who also is called paul filled with the holy ghost
set his eyes on him
and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of
the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to
pervert the right ways of the lord   and now behold the hand
of the lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the sun
for a season and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness
and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand
then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being
astonished at the doctrine of the lord
now when paul and his company loosed from paphos they came to
perga in pamphylia and john departing from them returned to
jerusalem
but when they departed from perga they came to antioch in
pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down
and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of
the synagogue sent unto them saying ye men and brethren if ye have
any word of exhortation for the people say on
then paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of
israel and ye that fear god give audience
the god of this people of israel chose our fathers and exalted
the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt and with
an high arm brought he them out of it
and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in
the wilderness
and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of chanaan
he divided their land to them by lot
and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four
hundred and fifty years until samuel the prophet
and afterward they desired a king and god gave unto them saul
the son of cis a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of forty
years
and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be
their king to whom also he gave their testimony and said i have
found david the son of jesse a man after mine own heart which shall
fulfil all my will
of this mans seed hath god according to his promise raised unto
israel a saviour jesus  when john had first preached before his
coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel
and as john fulfilled his course he said whom think ye that i
am  i am not he but behold there cometh one after me whose shoes
of his feet i am not worthy to loose
men and brethren children of the stock of abraham and
whosoever among you feareth god to you is the word of this salvation
sent
for they that dwell at jerusalem and their rulers because they
knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every
sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him
and though they found no cause of death in him yet desired they
pilate that he should be slain
and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they
took him down from the tree and laid him in a sepulchre
but god raised him from the dead  and he was seen many
days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem who are
his witnesses unto the people
and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which
was made unto the fathers  god hath fulfilled the same unto us
their children in that he hath raised up jesus again as it is also
written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten
thee
and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no
more to return to corruption he said on this wise i will give you
the sure mercies of david
wherefore he saith also in another psalm thou shalt not suffer
thine holy one to see corruption
for david after he had served his own generation by the will of
god fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption
but he whom god raised again saw no corruption
be it known unto you therefore men and brethren that through
this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins  and by
him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye
could not be justified by the law of moses
beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in
the prophets  behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for
i work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe
though a man declare it unto you
and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue the gentiles
besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath
now when the congregation was broken up many of the jews and
religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas who speaking to
them persuaded them to continue in the grace of god
and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to
hear the word of god
but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with
envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul
contradicting and blaspheming
then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary
that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing
ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
lo we turn to the gentiles
for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be
a light of the gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the
ends of the earth
and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified
the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life
believed
and the word of the lord was published throughout all the
region
but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and the
chief men of the city and raised persecution against paul and
barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts
but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came
unto iconium
and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy ghost
and it came to pass in iconium that they went both together into
the synagogue of the jews and so spake that a great multitude both
of the jews and also of the greeks believed
but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made their
minds evil affected against the brethren
long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord which
gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and
wonders to be done by their hands
but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the
jews and part with the apostles
and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also
of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone
them  they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derbe
cities of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about
and there they preached the gospel
and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet
being a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked  the
same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceiving
that he had faith to be healed  said with a loud voice stand
upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked
and when the people saw what paul had done they lifted up their
voices saying in the speech of lycaonia the gods are come down to us
in the likeness of men
and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because
he was the chief speaker
then the priest of jupiter which was before their city brought
oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with
the people
which when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of they rent
their clothes and ran in among the people crying out  and
saying sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passions
with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities
unto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and
all things that are therein  who in times past suffered all
nations to walk in their own ways
nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did
good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our
hearts with food and gladness
and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that
they had not done sacrifice unto them
and there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium
who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the
city supposing he had been dead
howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and
came into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas to
derbe
and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had
taught many they returned again to lystra and to iconium and
antioch  confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting
them to continue in the faith and that we must through much
tribulation enter into the kingdom of god
and when they had ordained them elders in every church and had
prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they
believed
and after they had passed throughout pisidia they came to
pamphylia
and when they had preached the word in perga they went down
into attalia  and thence sailed to antioch from whence they had
been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they
fulfilled
and when they were come and had gathered the church together
they rehearsed all that god had done with them and how he had opened
the door of faith unto the gentiles
and there they abode long time with the disciples
and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren
and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses ye
cannot be saved
when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and
disputation with them they determined that paul and barnabas and
certain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and
elders about this question
and being brought on their way by the church they passed through
phenice and samaria declaring the conversion of the gentiles and
they caused great joy unto all the brethren
and when they were come to jerusalem they were received of the
church and of the apostles and elders and they declared all things
that god had done with them
but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees which
believed saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to
command them to keep the law of moses
and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this
matter
and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and said
unto them men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago god
made choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the
word of the gospel and believe
and god which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving them
the holy ghost even as he did unto us  and put no difference
between us and them purifying their hearts by faith
now therefore why tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of
the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear
but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ
we shall be saved even as they
then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to
barnabas and paul declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought
among the gentiles by them
and after they had held their peace james answered saying men
and brethren hearken unto me  simeon hath declared how god at
the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his
name
and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written
after this i will return and will build again the tabernacle of
david which is fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereof
and i will set it up  that the residue of men might seek after
the lord and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the
lord who doeth all these things
known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the
world
wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from
among the gentiles are turned to god  but that we write unto
them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from
fornication and from things strangled and from blood
for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him
being read in the synagogues every sabbath day
then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church
to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and
barnabas namely judas surnamed barsabas and silas chief men among
the brethren  and they wrote letters by them after this manner
the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren
which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia
forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us
have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying ye must
be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment
it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send
chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul  men that
have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ
we have sent therefore judas and silas who shall also tell you
the same things by mouth
for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you
no greater burden than these necessary things  that ye abstain
from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things
strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye
shall do well fare ye well
so when they were dismissed they came to antioch and when they
had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle
which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation
and judas and silas being prophets also themselves exhorted
the brethren with many words and confirmed them
and after they had tarried there a space they were let go in
peace from the brethren unto the apostles
notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still
paul also and barnabas continued in antioch teaching and
preaching the word of the lord with many others also
and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and
visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of
the lord and see how they do
and barnabas determined to take with them john whose surname
was mark
but paul thought not good to take him with them who departed
from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work
and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed
asunder one from the other and so barnabas took mark and sailed unto
cyprus  and paul chose silas and departed being recommended by
the brethren unto the grace of god
and he went through syria and cilicia confirming the churches
then came he to derbe and lystra and behold a certain disciple
was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a
jewess and believed but his father was a greek  which was well
reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium
him would paul have to go forth with him and took and
circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters for
they knew all that his father was a greek
and as they went through the cities they delivered them the
decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders
which were at jerusalem
and so were the churches established in the faith and increased
in number daily
now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of
galatia and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in
asia  after they were come to mysia they assayed to go into
bithynia but the spirit suffered them not
and they passing by mysia came down to troas
and a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man of
macedonia and prayed him saying come over into macedonia and help
us
and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavoured to
go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for
to preach the gospel unto them
therefore loosing from troas we came with a straight course to
samothracia and the next day to neapolis  and from thence to
philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia and a
colony and we were in that city abiding certain days
and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side
where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the
women which resorted thither
and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city
of thyatira which worshipped god heard us whose heart the lord
opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul
and when she was baptized and her household she besought us
saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my
house and abide there and she constrained us
and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel
possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her
masters much gain by soothsaying  the same followed paul and us
and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god
which shew unto us the way of salvation
and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned and
said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come
out of her
and he came out the same hour
and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone
they caught paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace unto
the rulers  and brought them to the magistrates saying these
men being jews do exceedingly trouble our city  and teach
customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe
being romans
and the multitude rose up together against them and the
magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them
and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them
into prison charging the jailor to keep them safely  who
having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and
made their feet fast in the stocks
and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto
god and the prisoners heard them
and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the
foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors
were opened and every ones bands were loosed
and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and
seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have
killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled
but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm
for we are all here
then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling
and fell down before paul and silas  and brought them out and
said sirs what must i do to be saved   and they said believe
on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house
and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that
were in his house
and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their
stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway
and when he had brought them into his house he set meat before
them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house
and when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants saying
let those men go
and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the
magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in
peace
but paul said unto them they have beaten us openly uncondemned
being romans and have cast us into prison and now do they thrust us
out privily nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us
out
and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and
they feared when they heard that they were romans
and they came and besought them and brought them out and
desired them to depart out of the city
and they went out of the prison and entered into the house of
lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and
departed
now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they
came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews  and
paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days
reasoned with them out of the scriptures  opening and alleging
that christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead
and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ
and some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas and
of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a
few
but the jews which believed not moved with envy took unto them
certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and
set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of jason and
sought to bring them out to the people
and when they found them not they drew jason and certain
brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these that have turned
the world upside down are come hither also  whom jason hath
received and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar saying
that there is another king one jesus
and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when
they heard these things
and when they had taken security of jason and of the other they
let them go
and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night
unto berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews
these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they
received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the
scriptures daily whether those things were so
therefore many of them believed also of honourable women which
were greeks and of men not a few
but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of
god was preached of paul at berea they came thither also and stirred
up the people
and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it
were to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still
and they that conducted paul brought him unto athens and
receiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him
with all speed they departed
now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred
in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry
therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews and with
the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with
him
then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks
encountered him and some said what will this babbler say other
some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he
preached unto them jesus and the resurrection
and they took him and brought him unto areopagus saying may
we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is   for
thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know
therefore what these things mean
for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent
their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new
thing   then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said
ye men of athens i perceive that in all things ye are too
superstitious
for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar
with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye
ignorantly worship him declare i unto you
god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he
is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands
neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any
thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things
and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the
face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and
the bounds of their habitation  that they should seek the lord
if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far
from every one of us  for in him we live and move and have our
being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also
his offspring
forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to
think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven
by art and mans device
and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now
commandeth all men every where to repent  because he hath
appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness
by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance
unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead
and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some
mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter
so paul departed from among them
howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among the
which was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and
others with them
after these things paul departed from athens and came to
corinth  and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus
lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because that
claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome and came unto
them
and because he was of the same craft he abode with them and
wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers
and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the
jews and the greeks
and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was
pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was
christ
and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his
raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads i am
clean from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles
and he departed thence and entered into a certain mans house
named justus one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the
synagogue
and crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the
lord with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed
and were baptized
then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision be not
afraid but speak and hold not thy peace  for i am with thee
and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in
this city
and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word
of god among them
and when gallio was the deputy of achaia the jews made
insurrection with one accord against paul and brought him to the
judgment seat  saying this fellow persuadeth men to worship god
contrary to the law
and when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said unto
the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jews
reason would that i should bear with you  but if it be a
question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for i
will be no judge of such matters
and he drave them from the judgment seat
then all the greeks took sosthenes the chief ruler of the
synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat and gallio cared for
none of those things
and paul after this tarried there yet a good while and then
took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into syria and with
him priscilla and aquila having shorn his head in cenchrea for he
had a vow
and he came to ephesus and left them there but he himself
entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews
when they desired him to tarry longer time with them he
consented not  but bade them farewell saying i must by all
means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem but i will return
again unto you if god will and he sailed from ephesus
and when he had landed at caesarea and gone up and saluted the
church he went down to antioch
and after he had spent some time there he departed and went
over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order strengthening
all the disciples
and a certain jew named apollos born at alexandria an eloquent
man and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus
this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being
fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of
the lord knowing only the baptism of john
and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila
and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto
him the way of god more perfectly
and when he was disposed to pass into achaia the brethren
wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come
helped them much which had believed through grace  for he
mightily convinced the jews and that publickly shewing by the
scriptures that jesus was christ
and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul
having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and finding
certain disciples  he said unto them have ye received the holy
ghost since ye believed  and they said unto him we have not so much
as heard whether there be any holy ghost
and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they
said unto johns baptism
then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of
repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him
which should come after him that is on christ jesus
when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord
jesus
and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came
on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied
and all the men were about twelve
and he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of
three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the
kingdom of god
but when divers were hardened and believed not but spake evil
of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated
the disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus
and this continued by the space of two years so that all they
which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and
greeks
and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul  so
that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons
and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of
them
then certain of the vagabond jews exorcists took upon them to
call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus
saying we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth
and there were seven sons of one sceva a jew and chief of the
priests which did so
and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i
know but who are ye   and the man in whom the evil spirit was
leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that
they fled out of that house naked and wounded
and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at
ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus was
magnified
and many that believed came and confessed and shewed their
deeds
many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
together and burned them before all men and they counted the price
of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver
so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed
after these things were ended paul purposed in the spirit when
he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem
saying after i have been there i must also see rome
so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him
timotheus and erastus but he himself stayed in asia for a season
and the same time there arose no small stir about that way
for a certain man named demetrius a silversmith which made
silver shrines for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsmen
whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and
said sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth
moreover ye see and hear that not alone at ephesus but almost
throughout all asia this paul hath persuaded and turned away much
people saying that they be no gods which are made with hands
so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought but
also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised
and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world
worshippeth
and when they heard these sayings they were full of wrath and
cried out saying great is diana of the ephesians
and the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught
gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia pauls companions in travel
they rushed with one accord into the theatre
and when paul would have entered in unto the people the
disciples suffered him not
and certain of the chief of asia which were his friends sent
unto him desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the
theatre
some therefore cried one thing and some another for the
assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore they were
come together
and they drew alexander out of the multitude the jews putting
him forward and alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made
his defence unto the people
but when they knew that he was a jew all with one voice about
the space of two hours cried out great is diana of the ephesians
and when the townclerk had appeased the people he said ye men
of ephesus what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of
the ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana and of the
image which fell down from jupiter   seeing then that these
things cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do
nothing rashly
for ye have brought hither these men which are neither robbers
of churches nor yet blasphemers of your goddess
wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him
have a matter against any man the law is open and there are
deputies let them implead one another
but if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters it shall
be determined in a lawful assembly
for we are in danger to be called in question for this days
uproar there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this
concourse
and when he had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly
and after the uproar was ceased paul called unto him the
disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into macedonia
and when he had gone over those parts and had given them much
exhortation he came into greece  and there abode three months
and when the jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail into
syria he purposed to return through macedonia
and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea and of the
thessalonians aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe and
timotheus and of asia tychicus and trophimus
these going before tarried for us at troas
and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened
bread and came unto them to troas in five days where we abode seven
days
and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came
together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on
the morrow and continued his speech until midnight
and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were
gathered together
and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus
being fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he
sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken
up dead
and paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said
trouble not yourselves for his life is in him
when he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and
eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he
departed
and they brought the young man alive and were not a little
comforted
and we went before to ship and sailed unto assos there
intending to take in paul for so had he appointed minding himself to
go afoot
and when he met with us at assos we took him in and came to
mitylene
and we sailed thence and came the next day over against chios
and the next day we arrived at samos and tarried at trogyllium and
the next day we came to miletus
for paul had determined to sail by ephesus because he would not
spend the time in asia for he hasted if it were possible for him to
be at jerusalem the day of pentecost
and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of
the church
and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from
the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been
with you at all seasons  serving the lord with all humility of
mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the
lying in wait of the jews  and how i kept back nothing that was
profitable unto you but have shewed you and have taught you
publickly and from house to house  testifying both to the jews
and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our
lord jesus christ
and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not
knowing the things that shall befall me there  save that the
holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions
abide me
but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear
unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the
ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the
gospel of the grace of god
and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone
preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more
wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the
blood of all men
for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of
god
take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over
the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church
of god which he hath purchased with his own blood
for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves
enter in among you not sparing the flock
also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse
things to draw away disciples after them
therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years
i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears
and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his
grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance
among all them which are sanctified
i have coveted no mans silver or gold or apparel
yea ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto
my necessities and to them that were with me
i have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to
support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he
said it is more blessed to give than to receive
and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with
them all
and they all wept sore and fell on pauls neck and kissed him
sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they
should see his face no more and they accompanied him unto the ship
and it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and had
launched we came with a straight course unto coos and the day
following unto rhodes and from thence unto patara  and finding a
ship sailing over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth
now when we had discovered cyprus we left it on the left hand
and sailed into syria and landed at tyre for there the ship was to
unlade her burden
and finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to
paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem
and when we had accomplished those days we departed and went our
way and they all brought us on our way with wives and children till
we were out of the city and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed
and when we had taken our leave one of another we took ship and
they returned home again
and when we had finished our course from tyre we came to
ptolemais and saluted the brethren and abode with them one day
and the next day we that were of pauls company departed and
came unto caesarea and we entered into the house of philip the
evangelist which was one of the seven and abode with him
and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy
and as we tarried there many days there came down from judaea a
certain prophet named agabus
and when he was come unto us he took pauls girdle and bound
his own hands and feet and said thus saith the holy ghost so shall
the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall
deliver him into the hands of the gentiles
and when we heard these things both we and they of that place
besought him not to go up to jerusalem
then paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break mine
heart  for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at
jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus
and when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying the will
of the lord be done
and after those days we took up our carriages and went up to
jerusalem
there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesarea
and brought with them one mnason of cyprus an old disciple with whom
we should lodge
and when we were come to jerusalem the brethren received us
gladly
and the day following paul went in with us unto james and all
the elders were present
and when he had saluted them he declared particularly what
things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry
and when they heard it they glorified the lord and said unto
him thou seest brother how many thousands of jews there are which
believe and they are all zealous of the law  and they are
informed of thee that thou teachest all the jews which are among the
gentiles to forsake moses saying that they ought not to circumcise
their children neither to walk after the customs
what is it therefore the multitude must needs come together
for they will hear that thou art come
do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men which
have a vow on them  them take and purify thyself with them and
be at charges with them that they may shave their heads and all may
know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee
are nothing but that thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepest
the law
as touching the gentiles which believe we have written and
concluded that they observe no such thing save only that they keep
themselves from things offered to idols and from blood and from
strangled and from fornication
then paul took the men and the next day purifying himself with
them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the
days of purification until that an offering should be offered for
every one of them
and when the seven days were almost ended the jews which were
of asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people
and laid hands on him  crying out men of israel help this is
the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the
law and this place and further brought greeks also into the temple
and hath polluted this holy place
for they had seen before with him in the city trophimus an
ephesian whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple
and all the city was moved and the people ran together and
they took paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the
doors were shut
and as they went about to kill him tidings came unto the chief
captain of the band that all jerusalem was in an uproar
who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto
them and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers they left
beating of paul
then the chief captain came near and took him and commanded
him to be bound with two chains and demanded who he was and what he
had done
and some cried one thing some another among the multitude and
when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded him
to be carried into the castle
and when he came upon the stairs so it was that he was borne
of the soldiers for the violence of the people
for the multitude of the people followed after crying away
with him
and as paul was to be led into the castle he said unto the
chief captain may i speak unto thee who said canst thou speak
greek   art not thou that egyptian which before these days
madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand
men that were murderers   but paul said i am a man which am a
jew of tarsus a city in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and i
beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people
and when he had given him licence paul stood on the stairs and
beckoned with the hand unto the people and when there was made a
great silence he spake unto them in the hebrew tongue saying
men brethren and fathers hear ye my defence which i make now unto
you
and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them
they kept the more silence and he saith  i am verily a man
which am a jew born in tarsus a city in cilicia yet brought up in
this city at the feet of gamaliel and taught according to the perfect
manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as ye
all are this day
and i persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering
into prisons both men and women
as also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estate
of the elders from whom also i received letters unto the brethren
and went to damascus to bring them which were there bound unto
jerusalem for to be punished
and it came to pass that as i made my journey and was come
nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a
great light round about me
and i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me
saul saul why persecutest thou me   and i answered who art
thou lord and he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth whom thou
persecutest
and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid
but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me
and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto me
arise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of all
things which are appointed for thee to do
and when i could not see for the glory of that light being led
by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus
and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a
good report of all the jews which dwelt there  came unto me and
stood and said unto me brother saul receive thy sight and the same
hour i looked up upon him
and he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou
shouldest know his will and see that just one and shouldest hear the
voice of his mouth
for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast
seen and heard
and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away
thy sins calling on the name of the lord
and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem
even while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance  and saw
him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem
for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me
and i said lord they know that i imprisoned and beat in every
synagogue them that believed on thee  and when the blood of thy
martyr stephen was shed i also was standing by and consenting unto
his death and kept the raiment of them that slew him
and he said unto me depart for i will send thee far hence unto
the gentiles
and they gave him audience unto this word and then lifted up
their voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth for it
is not fit that he should live
and as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threw
dust into the air  the chief captain commanded him to be brought
into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging
that he might know wherefore they cried so against him
and as they bound him with thongs paul said unto the centurion
that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman
and uncondemned   when the centurion heard that he went and
told the chief captain saying take heed what thou doest for this
man is a roman
then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art
thou a roman he said yea
and the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i this
freedom and paul said but i was free born
then straightway they departed from him which should have
examined him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knew
that he was a roman and because he had bound him
on the morrow because he would have known the certainty
wherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him from his bands
and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and
brought paul down and set him before them
and paul earnestly beholding the council said men and
brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this
day
and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to
smite him on the mouth
then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou whited wall
for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be
smitten contrary to the law   and they that stood by said
revilest thou gods high priest   then said paul i wist not
brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shalt
not speak evil of the ruler of thy people
but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the
other pharisees he cried out in the council men and brethren i am a
pharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the
dead i am called in question
and when he had so said there arose a dissension between the
pharisees and the sadducees and the multitude was divided
for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither
angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both
and there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the
pharisees part arose and strove saying we find no evil in this
man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight
against god
and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain
fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded
the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and
to bring him into the castle
and the night following the lord stood by him and said be of
good cheer paul for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem so
must thou bear witness also at rome
and when it was day certain of the jews banded together and
bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor
drink till they had killed paul
and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy
and they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have
bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we
have slain paul
now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain
that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire
something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near
are ready to kill him
and when pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait he
went and entered into the castle and told paul
then paul called one of the centurions unto him and said bring
this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to
tell him
so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said
paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this
young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee
then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him
aside privately and asked him what is that thou hast to tell me
and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou
wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though they
would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly
but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him
of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath
that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and
now are they ready looking for a promise from thee
so the chief captain then let the young man depart and charged
him see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me
and he called unto him two centurions saying make ready two
hundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten
and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night  and
provide them beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safe
unto felix the governor
and he wrote a letter after this manner  claudius lysias
unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting
this man was taken of the jews and should have been killed of
them then came i with an army and rescued him having understood
that he was a roman
and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused
him i brought him forth into their council  whom i perceived to
be accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his
charge worthy of death or of bonds
and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man
i sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also
to say before thee what they had against him farewell
then the soldiers as it was commanded them took paul and
brought him by night to antipatris
on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and
returned to the castle  who when they came to caesarea and
delivered the epistle to the governor presented paul also before him
and when the governor had read the letter he asked of what
province he was and when he understood that he was of cilicia
i will hear thee said he when thine accusers are also come and he
commanded him to be kept in herods judgment hall
and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the
elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the
governor against paul
and when he was called forth tertullus began to accuse him
saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very
worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence  we
accept it always and in all places most noble felix with all
thankfulness
notwithstanding that i be not further tedious unto thee i pray
thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words
for we have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of
sedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of
the sect of the nazarenes  who also hath gone about to profane
the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law
but the chief captain lysias came upon us and with great
violence took him away out of our hands  commanding his accusers
to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge
of all these things whereof we accuse him
and the jews also assented saying that these things were so
then paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
speak answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years
a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself
because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but
twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship
and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man
neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the
city  neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse
me
but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call
heresy so worship i the god of my fathers believing all things which
are written in the law and in the prophets  and have hope toward
god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a
resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust
and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience
void to offence toward god and toward men
now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and
offerings
whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the
temple neither with multitude nor with tumult
who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had
ought against me
or else let these same here say if they have found any evil
doing in me while i stood before the council  except it be for
this one voice that i cried standing among them touching the
resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day
and when felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge
of that way he deferred them and said when lysias the chief captain
shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter
and he commanded a centurion to keep paul and to let him have
liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to
minister or come unto him
and after certain days when felix came with his wife drusilla
which was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning the
faith in christ
and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to
come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i
have a convenient season i will call for thee
he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul
that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and
communed with him
but after two years porcius festus came into felix room and
felix willing to shew the jews a pleasure left paul bound
now when festus was come into the province after three days he
ascended from caesarea to jerusalem
then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him
against paul and besought him  and desired favour against him
that he would send for him to jerusalem laying wait in the way to
kill him
but festus answered that paul should be kept at caesarea and
that he himself would depart shortly thither
let them therefore said he which among you are able go down
with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him
and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went
down unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat
commanded paul to be brought
and when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalem
stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against paul
which they could not prove
while he answered for himself neither against the law of the
jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i
offended any thing at all
but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and
said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these
things before me   then said paul i stand at caesars judgment
seat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as
thou very well knowest
for if i be an offender or have committed any thing worthy of
death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things
whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them i appeal
unto caesar
then festus when he had conferred with the council answered
hast thou appealed unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go
and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto
caesarea to salute festus
and when they had been there many days festus declared pauls
cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by
felix  about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests
and the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgment
against him
to whom i answered it is not the manner of the romans to
deliver any man to die before that he which is accused have the
accusers face to face and have licence to answer for himself
concerning the crime laid against him
therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the
morrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought
forth
against whom when the accusers stood up they brought none
accusation of such things as i supposed  but had certain
questions against him of their own superstition and of one jesus
which was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive
and because i doubted of such manner of questions i asked him
whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these
matters
but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of
augustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar
then agrippa said unto festus i would also hear the man myself
to morrow said he thou shalt hear him
and on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with
great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief
captains and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul
was brought forth
and festus said king agrippa and all men which are here
present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the
jews have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here crying that
he ought not to live any longer
but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death
and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to
send him
of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord wherefore
i have brought him forth before you and specially before thee o king
agrippa that after examination had i might have somewhat to write
for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not
withal to signify the crimes laid against him
then agrippa said unto paul thou art permitted to speak for
thyself
then paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself  i
think myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myself
this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of
the jews  especially because i know thee to be expert in all
customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech
thee to hear me patiently
my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among
mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews  which knew me
from the beginning if they would testify that after the most
straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee
and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of
god unto our fathers  unto which promise our twelve tribes
instantly serving god day and night hope to come for which hopes
sake king agrippa i am accused of the jews
why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that god
should raise the dead   i verily thought with myself that i
ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth
which thing i also did in jerusalem and many of the saints did
i shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priests
and when they were put to death i gave my voice against them
and i punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled them
to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them i persecuted
them even unto strange cities
whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission
from the chief priests  at midday o king i saw in the way a
light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round
about me and them which journeyed with me
and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice
speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why
persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks
and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom
thou persecutest
but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee
for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these
things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which i will
appear unto thee  delivering thee from the people and from the
gentiles unto whom now i send thee  to open their eyes and to
turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto
god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among
them which are sanctified by faith that is in me
whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the
heavenly vision  but shewed first unto them of damascus and at
jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to the
gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet
for repentance
for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went
about to kill me
having therefore obtained help of god i continue unto this day
witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than
those which the prophets and moses did say should come  that
christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise
from the dead and should shew light unto the people and to the
gentiles
and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice
paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad
but he said i am not mad most noble festus but speak forth
the words of truth and soberness
for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak
freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from
him for this thing was not done in a corner
king agrippa believest thou the prophets i know that thou
believest
then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a
christian
and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all
that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i am
except these bonds
and when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor
and bernice and they that sat with them  and when they were
gone aside they talked between themselves saying this man doeth
nothing worthy of death or of bonds
then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at
liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar
and when it was determined that we should sail into italy they
delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius a
centurion of augustus band
and entering into a ship of adramyttium we launched meaning to
sail by the coasts of asia one aristarchus a macedonian of
thessalonica being with us
and the next day we touched at sidon and julius courteously
entreated paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh
himself
and when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprus
because the winds were contrary
and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we
came to myra a city of lycia
and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into
italy and he put us therein
and when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come
over against cnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed under crete
over against salmone  and hardly passing it came unto a place
which is called the fair havens nigh whereunto was the city of lasea
now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous
because the fast was now already past paul admonished them  and
said unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt
and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our
lives
nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of
the ship more than those things which were spoken by paul
and because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more
part advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attain
to phenice and there to winter which is an haven of crete and lieth
toward the south west and north west
and when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had
obtained their purpose loosing thence they sailed close by crete
but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind
called euroclydon
and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the
wind we let her drive
and running under a certain island which is called clauda we
had much work to come by the boat  which when they had taken up
they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should
fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven
and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day
they lightened the ship  and the third day we cast out with our
own hands the tackling of the ship
and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no
small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then
taken away
but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them
and said sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed
from crete and to have gained this harm and loss
and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no
loss of any mans life among you but of the ship
for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am
and whom i serve  saying fear not paul thou must be brought
before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with
thee
wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it
shall be even as it was told me
howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island
but when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and
down in adria about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near
to some country  and sounded and found it twenty fathoms and
when they had gone a little further they sounded again and found it
fifteen fathoms
then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks they cast
four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day
and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they
had let down the boat into the sea under colour as though they would
have cast anchors out of the foreship  paul said to the
centurion and to the soldiers except these abide in the ship ye
cannot be saved
then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her
fall off
and while the day was coming on paul besought them all to take
meat saying this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and
continued fasting having taken nothing
wherefore i pray you to take some meat for this is for your
health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you
and when he had thus spoken he took bread and gave thanks to
god in presence of them all and when he had broken it he began to
eat
then were they all of good cheer and they also took some meat
and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and
sixteen souls
and when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship and
cast out the wheat into the sea
and when it was day they knew not the land but they discovered
a certain creek with a shore into the which they were minded if it
were possible to thrust in the ship
and when they had taken up the anchors they committed
themselves unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoised up
the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore
and falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship
aground and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmoveable but the
hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves
and the soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners lest any of
them should swim out and escape
but the centurion willing to save paul kept them from their
purpose and commanded that they which could swim should cast
themselves first into the sea and get to land  and the rest
some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship
and so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to land
and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was
called melita
and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness for they
kindled a fire and received us every one because of the present
rain and because of the cold
and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on
the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his
hand
and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand
they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom
though he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live
and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm
howbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down
dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no
harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a
god
in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
island whose name was publius who received us and lodged us three
days courteously
and it came to pass that the father of publius lay sick of a
fever and of a bloody flux to whom paul entered in and prayed and
laid his hands on him and healed him
so when this was done others also which had diseases in the
island came and were healed  who also honoured us with many
honours and when we departed they laded us with such things as were
necessary
and after three months we departed in a ship of alexandria
which had wintered in the isle whose sign was castor and pollux
and landing at syracuse we tarried there three days
and from thence we fetched a compass and came to rhegium and
after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to
puteoli  where we found brethren and were desired to tarry with
them seven days and so we went toward rome
and from thence when the brethren heard of us they came to
meet us as far as appii forum and the three taverns whom when paul
saw he thanked god and took courage
and when we came to rome the centurion delivered the prisoners
to the captain of the guard but paul was suffered to dwell by himself
with a soldier that kept him
and it came to pass that after three days paul called the chief
of the jews together and when they were come together he said unto
them men and brethren though i have committed nothing against the
people or customs of our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner from
jerusalem into the hands of the romans
who when they had examined me would have let me go because
there was no cause of death in me
but when the jews spake against it i was constrained to appeal
unto caesar not that i had ought to accuse my nation of
for this cause therefore have i called for you to see you and
to speak with you because that for the hope of israel i am bound with
this chain
and they said unto him we neither received letters out of
judaea concerning thee neither any of the brethren that came shewed
or spake any harm of thee
but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as
concerning this sect we know that every where it is spoken against
and when they had appointed him a day there came many to him
into his lodging to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of
god persuading them concerning jesus both out of the law of moses
and out of the prophets from morning till evening
and some believed the things which were spoken and some
believed not
and when they agreed not among themselves they departed after
that paul had spoken one word well spake the holy ghost by esaias the
prophet unto our fathers  saying go unto this people and say
hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall
see and not perceive  for the heart of this people is waxed
gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they
closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their
ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and i
should heal them
be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is
sent unto the gentiles and that they will hear it
and when he had said these words the jews departed and had
great reasoning among themselves
and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and
received all that came in unto him  preaching the kingdom of
god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ
with all confidence no man forbidding him
the epistle of paul the apostle to the romans
paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle
separated unto the gospel of god  which he had promised afore by
his prophets in the holy scriptures  concerning his son jesus
christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the
flesh  and declared to be the son of god with power according to
the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead  by whom
we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith
among all nations for his name  among whom are ye also the called
of jesus christ  to all that be in rome beloved of god called to
be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord
jesus christ
first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your
faith is spoken of throughout the whole world
for god is my witness whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel
of his son that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my
prayers  making request if by any means now at length i might
have a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you
for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual
gift to the end ye may be established  that is that i may be
comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me
now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i
purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that i might have
some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles
i am debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to
the wise and to the unwise
so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you
that are at rome also
for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power
of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first
and also to the greek
for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to
faith as it is written the just shall live by faith
for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in
unrighteousness  because that which may be known of god is
manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them
for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even
his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse
because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god
neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and
their foolish heart was darkened
professing themselves to be wise they became fools  and
changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to
corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping
things
wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts
of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves
who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and
served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever
amen
for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even
their women did change the natural use into that which is against
nature  and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the
woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working
that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of
their error which was meet
and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge
god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are
not convenient  being filled with all unrighteousness
fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy
murder debate deceit malignity whisperers  backbiters haters
of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things
disobedient to parents  without understanding covenantbreakers
without natural affection implacable unmerciful  who knowing
the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of
death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them
therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that
judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself
for thou that judgest doest the same things
but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth
against them which commit such things
and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such
things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of
god   or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance
and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee
to repentance   but after thy hardness and impenitent heart
treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and
revelation of the righteous judgment of god  who will render to
every man according to his deeds  to them who by patient
continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality
eternal life  but unto them that are contentious and do not obey
the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath
tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of
the jew first and also of the gentile  but glory honour and
peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to
the gentile  for there is no respect of persons with god
for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without
law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law
for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the
doers of the law shall be justified
for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the
things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto
themselves  which shew the work of the law written in their
hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the
mean while accusing or else excusing one another  in the day
when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to
my gospel
behold thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makest
thy boast of god  and knowest his will and approvest the things
that are more excellent being instructed out of the law  and art
confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them
which are in darkness  an instructor of the foolish a teacher of
babes which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law
thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself
thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal
thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commit
adultery thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilege
thou that makest thy boast of the law through breaking the law
dishonourest thou god   for the name of god is blasphemed among
the gentiles through you as it is written
for circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law but if
thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision
therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the
law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision
and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law
judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the
law   for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither is
that circumcision which is outward in the flesh  but he is a
jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in
the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of
god
what advantage then hath the jew or what profit is there of
circumcision   much every way chiefly because that unto them
were committed the oracles of god
for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the
faith of god without effect   god forbid yea let god be true
but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be
justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged
but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god what
shall we say is god unrighteous who taketh vengeance i speak as a
man  god forbid for then how shall god judge the world   for
if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory
why yet am i also judged as a sinner   and not rather as we be
slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say let us do
evil that good may come whose damnation is just
what then are we better than they no in no wise for we have
before proved both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin
as it is written there is none righteous no not one
there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after
god
they are all gone out of the way they are together become
unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one
their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they have
used deceit the poison of asps is under their lips  whose mouth
is full of cursing and bitterness  their feet are swift to shed
blood  destruction and misery are in their ways  and the way
of peace have they not known  there is no fear of god before
their eyes
now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to
them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all
the world may become guilty before god
therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin
but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested
being witnessed by the law and the prophets  even the
righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and
upon all them that believe for there is no difference  for all
have sinned and come short of the glory of god  being justified
freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus
whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his
blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are
past through the forbearance of god  to declare i say at this
time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of
him which believeth in jesus
where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of works
nay but by the law of faith
therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without
the deeds of the law
is he the god of the jews only is he not also of the gentiles
yes of the gentiles also  seeing it is one god which shall
justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith
do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we
establish the law
what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to
the flesh hath found   for if abraham were justified by works he
hath whereof to glory but not before god
for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was
counted unto him for righteousness
now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but
of debt
but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth
the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto
whom god imputeth righteousness without works  saying blessed are
they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered
blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin
cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon
the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham
for righteousness
how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in
uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision
and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the
righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that
he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not
circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also
and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision
only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father
abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised
for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not
to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the
righteousness of faith
for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void
and the promise made of none effect  because the law worketh
wrath for where no law is there is no transgression
therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end
the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is
of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is
the father of us all  as it is written i have made thee a
father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who
quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though
they were
who against hope believed in hope that he might become the
father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall
thy seed be
and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now
dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness
of sarahs womb  he staggered not at the promise of god through
unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god  and being
fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to
perform
and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness
now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to
him  but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe
on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead  who was
delivered for our offences and was raised again for our
justification
therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through
our lord jesus christ  by whom also we have access by faith into
this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that
tribulation worketh patience  and patience experience and
experience hope  and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of
god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto
us
for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for
the ungodly
for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure
for a good man some would even dare to die
but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet
sinners christ died for us
much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be
saved from wrath through him
for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the
death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by
his life
and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus
christ by whom we have now received the atonement
wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by
sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned
for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when
there is no law
nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them
that had not sinned after the similitude of adams transgression who
is the figure of him that was to come
but not as the offence so also is the free gift for if through
the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the
gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto
many
and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the
judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many
offences unto justification
for if by one mans offence death reigned by one much more they
which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness
shall reign in life by one jesus christ   therefore as by the
offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by
the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto
justification of life
for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by
the obedience of one shall many be made righteous
moreover the law entered that the offence might abound but
where sin abounded grace did much more abound  that as sin hath
reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness
unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord
what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may
abound   god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any
longer therein   know ye not that so many of us as were baptized
into jesus christ were baptized into his death   therefore we are
buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised
up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should
walk in newness of life
for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death
we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection  knowing
this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin
might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin
for he that is dead is freed from sin
now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live
with him  knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no
more death hath no more dominion over him
for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he
liveth he liveth unto god
likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin
but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord
let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should
obey it in the lusts thereof
neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness
unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from
the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god
for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under
the law but under grace
what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but
under grace god forbid
know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey
his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of
obedience unto righteousness   but god be thanked that ye were
the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of
doctrine which was delivered you
being then made free from sin ye became the servants of
righteousness
i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your
flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and
to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to
righteousness unto holiness
for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from
righteousness
what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed  for the end of those things is death
but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye
have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life
for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal
life through jesus christ our lord
know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law
how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth
for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband
so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from
the law of her husband
so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another
man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead
she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be
married to another man
wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the
body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who
is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god
for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by
the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death
but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we
were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the
oldness of the letter
what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i had not
known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law
had said thou shalt not covet
but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all
manner of concupiscence for without the law sin was dead
for i was alive without the law once but when the commandment
came sin revived and i died
and the commandment which was ordained to life i found to be
unto death
for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by
it slew me
wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just
and good
was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but
sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is
good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful
for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold
under sin
for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not
but what i hate that do i
if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that
it is good
now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me
for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which
is good i find not
for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would
not that i do
now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin
that dwelleth in me
i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present
with me
for i delight in the law of god after the inward man  but i
see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and
bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members
o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of
this death   i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then
with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the
law of sin
there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ
jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit
for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me
free from the law of sin and death
for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the
flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
for sin condemned sin in the flesh  that the righteousness of the
law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after
the spirit
for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh
but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit
for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded
is life and peace
because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not
subject to the law of god neither indeed can be
so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god
but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the
spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of
christ he is none of his
and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the
spirit is life because of righteousness
but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell
in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you
therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live
after the flesh
for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through
the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live
for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of
god
for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but
ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father
the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are
the children of god  and if children then heirs heirs of god
and jointheirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we
may be also glorified together
for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us
for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
manifestation of the sons of god
for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but
by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope  because the
creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption
into the glorious liberty of the children of god
for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain together until now
and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits
of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for
the adoption to wit the redemption of our body
for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for
what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for   but if we hope for
that we see not then do we with patience wait for it
likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not
what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered
and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the
spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the
will of god
and we know that all things work together for good to them that
love god to them who are the called according to his purpose
for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn
among many brethren
moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom
he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also
glorified
what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can
be against us   he that spared not his own son but delivered him
up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all
things   who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect it
is god that justifieth
who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather
that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also
maketh intercession for us
who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation
or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or
sword   as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day
long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
that loved us
for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor
principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come
nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to
separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord
i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing
me witness in the holy ghost  that i have great heaviness and
continual sorrow in my heart
for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my
brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh  who are israelites
to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and
the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises
whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ
came who is over all god blessed for ever amen
not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for they are
not all israel which are of israel  neither because they are the
seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed
be called
that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not
the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for
the seed
for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and
sarah shall have a son
and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one
even by our father isaac  for the children being not yet born
neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god
according to election might stand not of works but of him that
calleth  it was said unto her the elder shall serve the
younger
as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god
forbid
for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have
mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion
so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth
but of god that sheweth mercy
for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose
have i raised thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that my
name might be declared throughout all the earth
therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he
will he hardeneth
thou wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault for who
hath resisted his will   nay but o man who art thou that
repliest against god shall the thing formed say to him that formed
it why hast thou made me thus   hath not the potter power over
the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another
unto dishonour   what if god willing to shew his wrath and to
make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of
wrath fitted to destruction  and that he might make known the
riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore
prepared unto glory  even us whom he hath called not of the
jews only but also of the gentiles   as he saith also in osee i
will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved
which was not beloved
and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said
unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the
children of the living god
esaias also crieth concerning israel though the number of the
children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be
saved  for he will finish the work and cut it short in
righteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth
and as esaias said before except the lord of sabaoth had left us
a seed we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha
what shall we say then that the gentiles which followed not
after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the
righteousness which is of faith
but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath
not attained to the law of righteousness
wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by
the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumblingstone
as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of
offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed
brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that
they might be saved
for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not
according to knowledge
for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about
to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves
unto the righteousness of god
for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one
that believeth
for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that
the man which doeth those things shall live by them
but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise
say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to
bring christ down from above  or who shall descend into the
deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead   but
what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy
heart that is the word of faith which we preach  that if thou
shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in
thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be
saved
for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with
the mouth confession is made unto salvation
for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be
ashamed
for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for
the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him
for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be
saved
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed
and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how
shall they hear without a preacher   and how shall they preach
except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of
them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good
things   but they have not all obeyed the gospel for esaias
saith lord who hath believed our report   so then faith cometh
by hearing and hearing by the word of god
but i say have they not heard yes verily their sound went
into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world
but i say did not israel know first moses saith i will
provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish
nation i will anger you
but esaias is very bold and saith i was found of them that
sought me not i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me
but to israel he saith all day long i have stretched forth my
hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people
i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also
am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin
god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew wot ye not
what the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to god
against israel saying  lord they have killed thy prophets and
digged down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life
but what saith the answer of god unto him i have reserved to
myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of
baal
even so then at this present time also there is a remnant
according to the election of grace
and if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is
no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more grace
otherwise work is no more work
what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for
but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded
according as it is written god hath given them the spirit of
slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not
hear unto this day
and david saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and
a stumblingblock and a recompence unto them  let their eyes be
darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway
i say then have they stumbled that they should fall god
forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the
gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy
now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the
diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their
fulness   for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the
apostle of the gentiles i magnify mine office  if by any means
i may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save
some of them
for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world
what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead
for if the firstfruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root
be holy so are the branches
and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a
wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest
of the root and fatness of the olive tree  boast not against the
branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root
thee
thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i might
be graffed in
well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou
standest by faith be not highminded but fear  for if god
spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not
thee
behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which
fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his
goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off
and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be
graffed in for god is able to graff them in again
for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by
nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree
how much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffed
into their own olive tree   for i would not brethren that ye
should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own
conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the
fulness of the gentiles be come in
and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall
come out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from
jacob  for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away
their sins
as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but
as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers sakes
for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance
for as ye in times past have not believed god yet have now
obtained mercy through their unbelief  even so have these also
now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy
for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have
mercy upon all
o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of
god  how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding
out   for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been
his counsellor   or who hath first given to him and it shall be
recompensed unto him again   for of him and through him and to
him are all things to whom be glory for ever amen
i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god
which is your reasonable service
and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and
acceptable and perfect will of god
for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is
among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think
but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the
measure of faith
for as we have many members in one body and all members have not
the same office  so we being many are one body in christ and
every one members one of another
having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given
to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion
of faith  or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that
teacheth on teaching  or he that exhorteth on exhortation he
that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with
diligence he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness
let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil
cleave to that which is good
be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in
honour preferring one another  not slothful in business fervent
in spirit serving the lord  rejoicing in hope patient in
tribulation continuing instant in prayer  distributing to the
necessity of saints given to hospitality
bless them which persecute you bless and curse not
rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep
be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things
but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits
recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the
sight of all men
if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with
all men
dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place
unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith
the lord
therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give
him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head
be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good
let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no
power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god
whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance
of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation
for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil wilt
thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou
shalt have praise of the same  for he is the minister of god to
thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he
beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a
revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil
wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also
for conscience sake
for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are gods
ministers attending continually upon this very thing
render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is
due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour
owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth
another hath fulfilled the law
for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill
thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt
not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly
comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself
love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the
fulfilling of the law
and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake
out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed
the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore
cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light
let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and
drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and
envying
but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for
the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof
him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful
disputations
for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is
weak eateth herbs
let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not
him which eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath received him
who art thou that judgest another mans servant to his own
master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holden up for god is
able to make him stand
one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every
day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind
he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord and he
that regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard it he that
eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that
eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks
for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself
for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die
we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the
lords
for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he
might be lord both of the dead and living
but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at
nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of
christ
for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall
bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god
so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god
let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this
rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his
brothers way
i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there is
nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be
unclean to him it is unclean
but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou
not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom christ died
let not then your good be evil spoken of  for the kingdom
of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in
the holy ghost
for he that in these things serveth christ is acceptable to god
and approved of men
let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace
and things wherewith one may edify another
for meat destroy not the work of god all things indeed are
pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence
it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any
thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak
hast thou faith have it to thyself before god happy is he that
condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth
and he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not
of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin
we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
weak and not to please ourselves
let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to
edification
for even christ pleased not himself but as it is written the
reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me
for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might
have hope
now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be
likeminded one toward another according to christ jesus  that ye
may with one mind and one mouth glorify god even the father of our
lord jesus christ
wherefore receive ye one another as christ also received us to
the glory of god
now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision
for the truth of god to confirm the promises made unto the fathers
and that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy as it is
written for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles and
sing unto thy name
and again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people
and again praise the lord all ye gentiles and laud him all
ye people
and again esaias saith there shall be a root of jesse and he
that shall rise to reign over the gentiles in him shall the gentiles
trust
now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy
ghost
and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also
are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish
one another
nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldly unto you
in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is
given to me of god  that i should be the minister of jesus
christ to the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that the
offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by
the holy ghost
i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in
those things which pertain to god
for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ
hath not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word and
deed  through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the
spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum
i have fully preached the gospel of christ
yea so have i strived to preach the gospel not where christ
was named lest i should build upon another mans foundation
but as it is written to whom he was not spoken of they shall see
and they that have not heard shall understand
for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming to
you
but now having no more place in these parts and having a great
desire these many years to come unto you  whensoever i take my
journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my
journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be
somewhat filled with your company
but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints
for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a
certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem
it hath pleased them verily and their debtors they are for if
the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their
duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things
when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them
this fruit i will come by you into spain
and i am sure that when i come unto you i shall come in the
fulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ
now i beseech you brethren for the lord jesus christs sake
and for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in
your prayers to god for me  that i may be delivered from them
that do not believe in judaea and that my service which i have for
jerusalem may be accepted of the saints  that i may come unto
you with joy by the will of god and may with you be refreshed
now the god of peace be with you all amen
i commend unto you phebe our sister which is a servant of the
church which is at cenchrea  that ye receive her in the lord as
becometh saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she
hath need of you for she hath been a succourer of many and of myself
also
greet priscilla and aquila my helpers in christ jesus  who
have for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only i give
thanks but also all the churches of the gentiles
likewise greet the church that is in their house salute my
wellbeloved epaenetus who is the firstfruits of achaia unto christ
greet mary who bestowed much labour on us
salute andronicus and junia my kinsmen and my fellowprisoners
who are of note among the apostles who also were in christ before me
greet amplias my beloved in the lord
salute urbane our helper in christ and stachys my beloved
salute apelles approved in christ salute them which are of
aristobulus household
salute herodion my kinsman greet them that be of the household
of narcissus which are in the lord
salute tryphena and tryphosa who labour in the lord salute the
beloved persis which laboured much in the lord
salute rufus chosen in the lord and his mother and mine
salute asyncritus phlegon hermas patrobas hermes and the
brethren which are with them
salute philologus and julia nereus and his sister and
olympas and all the saints which are with them
salute one another with an holy kiss the churches of christ
salute you
now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and
offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid
them
for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but
their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the
hearts of the simple
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men i am glad
therefore on your behalf but yet i would have you wise unto that
which is good and simple concerning evil
and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen
timotheus my workfellow and lucius and jason and sosipater
my kinsmen salute you
i tertius who wrote this epistle salute you in the lord
gaius mine host and of the whole church saluteth you erastus
the chamberlain of the city saluteth you and quartus a brother
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my
gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation
of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began  but
now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according
to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations
for the obedience of faith  to god only wise be glory through
jesus christ for ever amen
the first epistle of paul the apostle to the corinthians
paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of
god and sosthenes our brother  unto the church of god which is at
corinth to them that are sanctified in christ jesus called to be
saints with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus
christ our lord both theirs and ours  grace be unto you and
peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ
i thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of god which
is given you by jesus christ  that in every thing ye are enriched
by him in all utterance and in all knowledge  even as the
testimony of christ was confirmed in you  so that ye come behind
in no gift waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ  who
shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the
day of our lord jesus christ
god is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his
son jesus christ our lord
now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus
christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no
divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the
same mind and in the same judgment
for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them
which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you
now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and i
of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ
is christ divided was paul crucified for you or were ye
baptized in the name of paul   i thank god that i baptized none
of you but crispus and gaius  lest any should say that i had
baptized in mine own name
and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know
not whether i baptized any other
for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not
with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none
effect
for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god
for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and
will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent
where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of
this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world
for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god
it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
believe
for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom
but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock
and unto the greeks foolishness  but unto them which are called
both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god
because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the
weakness of god is stronger than men
for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men
after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called  but
god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise
and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the
things which are mighty  and base things of the world and things
which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to
bring to nought things that are  that no flesh should glory in
his presence
but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us
wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption
that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in
the lord
and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of
speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god
for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesus
christ and him crucified
and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much
trembling
and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of
mans wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power
that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the
power of god
howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the
wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to
nought  but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the
hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory
which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it
they would not have crucified the lord of glory
but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither
have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared
for them that love him
but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit
searcheth all things yea the deep things of god
for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man
which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the
spirit of god
now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit
which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given
to us of god
which things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdom
teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual
things with spiritual
but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of
god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them
because they are spiritually discerned
but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is
judged of no man
for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct
him  but we have the mind of christ
and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but
as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ
i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were
not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able
for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and
strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men   for
while one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye
not carnal   who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers
by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man   i have
planted apollos watered but god gave the increase
so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that
watereth but god that giveth the increase
now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man
shall receive his own reward according to his own labour
for we are labourers together with god ye are gods husbandry ye
are gods building
according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise
masterbuilder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth
thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon
for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is
jesus christ
now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious
stones wood hay stubble  every mans work shall be made
manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed
by fire and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is
if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall
receive a reward
if any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he
himself shall be saved yet so as by fire
know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of
god dwelleth in you   if any man defile the temple of god him
shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are
let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be
wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise
for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is
written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness
and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they
are vain
therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours
whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or
death or things present or things to come all are yours  and
ye are christs and christ is gods
let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and
stewards of the mysteries of god
moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful
but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of
you or of mans judgment yea i judge not mine own self
for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified but
he that judgeth me is the lord
therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who
both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make
manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have
praise of god
and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to
myself and to apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to
think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed
up for one against another
for who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou
that thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive it why dost
thou glory as if thou hadst not received it   now ye are full
now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would to
god ye did reign that we also might reign with you
for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last as it
were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world
and to angels and to men
we are fools for christs sake but ye are wise in christ we are
weak but ye are strong ye are honourable but we are despised
even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are
naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace  and
labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being
persecuted we suffer it  being defamed we intreat we are made
as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto
this day
i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i
warn you
for though ye have ten thousand instructers in christ yet have
ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through
the gospel
wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me
for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved
son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of
my ways which be in christ as i teach every where in every church
now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you
but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know
not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power
for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power
what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and
in the spirit of meekness   it is reported commonly that there is
fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named
among the gentiles that one should have his fathers wife
and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that
hath done this deed might be taken away from among you
for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have
judged already as though i were present concerning him that hath so
done this deed  in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are
gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus
christ  to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of
the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus
your glorying is not good know ye not that a little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump   purge out therefore the old leaven
that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even christ our
passover is sacrificed for us  therefore let us keep the feast
not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness
but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators
yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with
the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye
needs go out of the world
but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man
that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater
or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not
to eat
for what have i to do to judge them also that are without do not
ye judge them that are within   but them that are without god
judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person
dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before
the unjust and not before the saints   do ye not know that the
saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you
are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters   know ye not that
we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life
if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set
them to judge who are least esteemed in the church
i speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man
among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his
brethren   but brother goeth to law with brother and that before
the unbelievers
now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to
law one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not
rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded   nay ye do wrong and
defraud and that your brethren
know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
god  be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor
adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind
nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor
extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god
and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are
sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by
the spirit of our god
all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient
all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the
power of any
meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall
destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for
the lord and the lord for the body
and god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us
by his own power
know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i
then take the members of christ and make them the members of an
harlot god forbid
what know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one
body  for two saith he shall be one flesh
but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit
flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body
but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body
what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost
which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own
for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body
and in your spirit which are gods
now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for
a man not to touch a woman
nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own
wife and let every woman have her own husband
let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise
also the wife unto the husband
the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and
likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the
wife
defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a
time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come
together again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency
but i speak this by permission and not of commandment
for i would that all men were even as i myself but every man hath
his proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that
i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them
if they abide even as i
but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to
marry than to burn
and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not
the wife depart from her husband  but and if she depart let her
remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the
husband put away his wife
but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother hath a wife
that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not
put her away
and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he
be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him
for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children
unclean but now are they holy
but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or a
sister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us to
peace
for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy
husband  or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy
wife   but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath
called every one so let him walk and so ordain i in all churches
is any man called being circumcised let him not become
uncircumcised is any called in uncircumcision let him not be
circumcised
circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the
keeping of the commandments of god
let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called
art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou
mayest be made free use it rather
for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lords
freeman likewise also he that is called being free is christs
servant
ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men
brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with
god
now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i
give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be
faithful
i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i
say that it is good for a man so to be
art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed art thou
loosed from a wife seek not a wife
but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin
marry she hath not sinned nevertheless such shall have trouble in
the flesh but i spare you
but this i say brethren the time is short it remaineth that
both they that have wives be as though they had none  and they
that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though
they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not
and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion
of this world passeth away
but i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried
careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the
lord  but he that is married careth for the things that are of
the world how he may please his wife
there is difference also between a wife and a virgin the
unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be
holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for
the things of the world how she may please her husband
and this i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snare
upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon
the lord without distraction
but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his
virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let
him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry
nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no
necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in
his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well
so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that
giveth her not in marriage doeth better
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but
if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she
will only in the lord
but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and i
think also that i have the spirit of god
now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all
have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth
and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing
yet as he ought to know
but if any man love god the same is known of him
as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are
offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in
the world and that there is none other god but one
for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in
earth as there be gods many and lords many  but to us there is
but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and
one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him
howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with
conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto
an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled
but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we
the better neither if we eat not are we the worse
but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a
stumblingblock to them that are weak
for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the
idols temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be
emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols  and
through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ
died   but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their
weak conscience ye sin against christ
wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh
while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend
am i not an apostle am i not free have i not seen jesus christ
our lord are not ye my work in the lord   if i be not an apostle
unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine
apostleship are ye in the lord
mine answer to them that do examine me is this  have we not
power to eat and to drink   have we not power to lead about a
sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the
lord and cephas   or i only and barnabas have not we power to
forbear working   who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges
who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who
feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock   say i
these things as a man or saith not the law the same also   for it
is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the
ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for oxen   or
saith he it altogether for our sakes for our sakes no doubt this is
written that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that
thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope
if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if
we shall reap your carnal things   if others be partakers of this
power over you are not we rather  nevertheless we have not used this
power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of
christ
do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of
the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are
partakers with the altar   even so hath the lord ordained that
they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel
but i have used none of these things neither have i written
these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better
for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void
for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for
necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the
gospel   for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but
if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me
what is my reward then verily that when i preach the gospel i
may make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not my
power in the gospel
for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant
unto all that i might gain the more
and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews
to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain
them that are under the law  to them that are without law as
without law being not without law to god but under the law to
christ that i might gain them that are without law
to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am
made all things to all men that i might by all means save some
and this i do for the gospels sake that i might be partaker
thereof with you
know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one
receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain
and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all
things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an
incorruptible
i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one
that beateth the air  but i keep under my body and bring it into
subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i
myself should be a castaway
moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how
that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the
sea  and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the
sea  and did all eat the same spiritual meat  and did all
drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock
that followed them and that rock was christ
but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were
overthrown in the wilderness
now these things were our examples to the intent we should not
lust after evil things as they also lusted
neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written
the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play
neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and
fell in one day three and twenty thousand
neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and
were destroyed of serpents
neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were
destroyed of the destroyer
now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they
are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are
come
wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
fall
there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man
but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that
ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape
that ye may be able to bear it
wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry
i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say
the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of
the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion
of the body of christ   for we being many are one bread and one
body for we are all partakers of that one bread
behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the
sacrifices partakers of the altar   what say i then that the
idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is
any thing   but i say that the things which the gentiles
sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to god and i would not
that ye should have fellowship with devils
ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye
cannot be partakers of the lords table and of the table of devils
do we provoke the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he
all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient
all things are lawful for me but all things edify not
let no man seek his own but every man anothers wealth
whatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no question
for conscience sake  for the earth is the lords and the
fulness thereof
if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be
disposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question
for conscience sake
but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto
idols eat not for his sake that shewed it and for conscience sake
for the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof
conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is my
liberty judged of another mans conscience   for if i by grace
be a partaker why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give
thanks   whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye
do do all to the glory of god
give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor
to the church of god  even as i please all men in all things
not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be
saved
be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ
now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things
and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you
but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ
and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god
every man praying or prophesying having his head covered
dishonoureth his head
but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she
were shaven
for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it
be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is
the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man
for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man
neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the
man
for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because
of the angels
nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the
woman without the man in the lord
for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the
woman but all things of god
judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god
uncovered   doth not even nature itself teach you that if a
man have long hair it is a shame unto him   but if a woman have
long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a
covering
but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom
neither the churches of god
now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye
come together not for the better but for the worse
for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear
that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it
for there must be also heresies among you that they which are
approved may be made manifest among you
when ye come together therefore into one place this is not to
eat the lords supper
for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and
one is hungry and another is drunken
what have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye
the church of god and shame them that have not what shall i say to
you shall i praise you in this i praise you not
for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto
you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took
bread  and when he had given thanks he brake it and said
take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in
remembrance of me
after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped
saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft
as ye drink it in remembrance of me
for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do
shew the lords death till he come
wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of
the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the
lord
but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread
and drink of that cup
for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
damnation to himself not discerning the lords body
for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many
sleep
for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged
but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we
should not be condemned with the world
wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one
for another
and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not
together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i
come
now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you
ignorant
ye know that ye were gentiles carried away unto these dumb
idols even as ye were led
wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the
spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that
jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost
now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit
and there are differences of administrations but the same lord
and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god
which worketh all in all
but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to
profit withal
for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another
the word of knowledge by the same spirit  to another faith by the
same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit
to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another
discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another
the interpretation of tongues  but all these worketh that one
and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will
for as the body is one and hath many members and all the
members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ
for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we
be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all
made to drink into one spirit
for the body is not one member but many
if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of
the body is it therefore not of the body   and if the ear shall
say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore
not of the body   if the whole body were an eye where were the
hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling
but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it
hath pleased him
and if they were all one member where were the body   but
now are they many members yet but one body
and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee
nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you
nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more
feeble are necessary  and those members of the body which we
think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant
honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness
for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the
body together having given more abundant honour to that part which
lacked
that there should be no schism in the body but that the members
should have the same care one for another
and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it
or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it
now ye are the body of christ and members in particular
and god hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily
prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of
healings helps governments diversities of tongues
are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all
workers of miracles   have all the gifts of healing do all
speak with tongues do all interpret   but covet earnestly the
best gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way
though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have
not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal
and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all
mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i
could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing
and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i
give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me
nothing
charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity
vaunteth not itself is not puffed up  doth not behave itself
unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no
evil  rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth
beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth
all things
charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they
shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there
be knowledge it shall vanish away
for we know in part and we prophesy in part
but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in
part shall be done away
when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child
i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish
things
for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face
now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known
and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the
greatest of these is charity
follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that
ye may prophesy
for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men
but unto god for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he
speaketh mysteries
but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and
exhortation and comfort
he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he
that prophesieth edifieth the church
i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye
prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh
with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive
edifying
now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what
shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation
or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine   and even
things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they
give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped
or harped   for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall
prepare himself to the battle   so likewise ye except ye utter
by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what
is spoken for ye shall speak into the air
there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and
none of them is without signification
therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice i shall be
unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a
barbarian unto me
even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek
that ye may excel to the edifying of the church
wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that
he may interpret
for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my
understanding is unfruitful
what is it then i will pray with the spirit and i will pray
with the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and i will
sing with the understanding also
else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that
occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks
seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest   for thou verily
givest thanks well but the other is not edified
i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all  yet
in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding
that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in
an unknown tongue
brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be
ye children but in understanding be men
in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other
lips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not
hear me saith the lord
wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but
to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that
believe not but for them which believe
if therefore the whole church be come together into one place
and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are
unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad
but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one
unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all  and thus
are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his
face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth
how is it then brethren when ye come together every one of
you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation
hath an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying
if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at
the most by three and that by course and let one interpret
but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the
church and let him speak to himself and to god
let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge
if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by let the
first hold his peace
for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all
may be comforted
and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets
for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all
churches of the saints
let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not
permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under
obedience as also saith the law
and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at
home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church
what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you
only   if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual
let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the
commandments of the lord
but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant
wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak
with tongues
let all things be done decently and in order
moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i
preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand
by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached
unto you unless ye have believed in vain
for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received
how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures
and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according
to the scriptures  and that he was seen of cephas then of the
twelve  after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at
once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are
fallen asleep
after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles
and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due
time
for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called
an apostle because i persecuted the church of god
but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was
bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than
they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me
therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye
believed
now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say
some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead   but
if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen
and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your
faith is also vain
yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have
testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if
so be that the dead rise not
for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised  and
if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins
then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished
if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men
most miserable
but now is christ risen from the dead and become the
firstfruits of them that slept
for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection
of the dead
for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made
alive
but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits
afterward they that are christs at his coming
then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom
to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all
authority and power
for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet
the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death
for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all
things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which
did put all things under him
and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the
son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him
that god may be all in all
else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the
dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead
and why stand we in jeopardy every hour   i protest by your
rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily
if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus
what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink
for to morrow we die
be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners
awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the
knowledge of god i speak this to your shame
but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what
body do they come   thou fool that which thou sowest is not
quickened except it die  and that which thou sowest thou
sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of
wheat or of some other grain  but god giveth it a body as it
hath pleased him and to every seed his own body
all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh
of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of
birds
there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the
glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is
another
there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon
and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another
star in glory
so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in
corruption it is raised in incorruption  it is sown in
dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised
in power  it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual
body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body
and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul
the last adam was made a quickening spirit
howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is
natural and afterward that which is spiritual
the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the
lord from heaven
as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is
the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly
and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear
the image of the heavenly
now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption
behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we
shall all be changed  in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be
raised incorruptible and we shall be changed
for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal
must put on immortality
so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and
this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to
pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory
o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory
the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law
but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our
lord jesus christ
therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable
always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that
your labour is not in vain in the lord
now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given
order to the churches of galatia even so do ye
upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in
store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i
come
and when i come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters
them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem
and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me
now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia
for i do pass through macedonia
and it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you that
ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go
for i will not see you now by the way but i trust to tarry a
while with you if the lord permit
but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost
for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are
many adversaries
now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear
for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do
let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in
peace that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brethren
as touching our brother apollos i greatly desired him to come
unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at
this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time
watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong
let all your things be done with charity
i beseech you brethren ye know the house of stephanas that
it is the firstfruits of achaia and that they have addicted
themselves to the ministry of the saints  that ye submit
yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with us and
laboureth
i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and
achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied
for they have refreshed my spirit and yours therefore
acknowledge ye them that are such
the churches of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute you
much in the lord with the church that is in their house
all the brethren greet you greet ye one another with
an holy kiss
the salutation of me paul with mine own hand
if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be
anathema maranatha
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you
my love be with you all in christ jesus amen
the second epistle of paul the apostle to the corinthians
paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy
our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth with all the
saints which are in all achaia  grace be to you and peace from god
our father and from the lord jesus christ
blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the
father of mercies and the god of all comfort  who comforteth us
in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are
in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of
god
for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation
also aboundeth by christ
and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and
salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings
which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your
consolation and salvation
and our hope of you is stedfast knowing that as ye are partakers
of the sufferings so shall ye be also of the consolation
for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which
came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above
strength insomuch that we despaired even of life  but we had the
sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves
but in god which raiseth the dead  who delivered us from so great
a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver
us  ye also helping together by prayer for us that for the gift
bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by
many on our behalf
for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that
in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the
grace of god we have had our conversation in the world and more
abundantly to youward
for we write none other things unto you than what ye read or
acknowledge and i trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end  as
also ye have acknowledged us in part that we are your rejoicing even
as ye also are ours in the day of the lord jesus
and in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before that
ye might have a second benefit  and to pass by you into
macedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you to
be brought on my way toward judaea
when i therefore was thus minded did i use lightness or the
things that i purpose do i purpose according to the flesh that with
me there should be yea yea and nay nay   but as god is true our
word toward you was not yea and nay
for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by
us even by me and silvanus and timotheus was not yea and nay but in
him was yea
for all the promises of god in him are yea and in him amen unto
the glory of god by us
now he which stablisheth us with you in christ and hath anointed
us is god  who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the
spirit in our hearts
moreover i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you
i came not as yet unto corinth
not for that we have dominion over your faith but are helpers of
your joy for by faith ye stand
but i determined this with myself that i would not come again to
you in heaviness
for if i make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but
the same which is made sorry by me   and i wrote this same unto
you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought
to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of
you all
for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you
with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know
the love which i have more abundantly unto you
but if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part
that i may not overcharge you all
sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted
of many
so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort
him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch
sorrow
wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward
him
for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof of
you whether ye be obedient in all things
to whom ye forgive any thing i forgive also for if i forgave
any thing to whom i forgave it for your sakes forgave i it in the
person of christ  lest satan should get an advantage of us for
we are not ignorant of his devices
furthermore when i came to troas to preach christs gospel and
a door was opened unto me of the lord  i had no rest in my
spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of
them i went from thence into macedonia
now thanks be unto god which always causeth us to triumph in
christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every
place
for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are
saved and in them that perish  to the one we are the savour of
death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life and
who is sufficient for these things   for we are not as many
which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in
the sight of god speak we in christ
do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some
others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation
from you   ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and
read of all men  forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the
epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the
spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables
of the heart
and such trust have we through christ to godward  not that we
are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but
our sufficiency is of god  who also hath made us able ministers of
the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the
letter killeth but the spirit giveth life
but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones
was glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastly
behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory
was to be done away  how shall not the ministration of the spirit
be rather glorious   for if the ministration of condemnation be
glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in
glory
for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this
respect by reason of the glory that excelleth
for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which
remaineth is glorious
seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of
speech  and not as moses which put a vail over his face that
the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that
which is abolished  but their minds were blinded for until this
day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old
testament which vail is done away in christ
but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon
their heart
nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be
taken away
now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is
there is liberty
but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of
the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as
by the spirit of the lord
therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy
we faint not  but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty
not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully
but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans
conscience in the sight of god
but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost  in
whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which
believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is
the image of god should shine unto them
for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and
ourselves your servants for jesus sake
for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath
shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
of god in the face of jesus christ
but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency
of the power may be of god and not of us
we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are
perplexed but not in despair  persecuted but not forsaken cast
down but not destroyed  always bearing about in the body the
dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made
manifest in our body
for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus sake
that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal
flesh
so then death worketh in us but life in you
we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i
believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore
speak  knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise
up us also by jesus and shall present us with you
for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might
through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god
for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish
yet the inward man is renewed day by day
for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for
us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory  while we
look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not
seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which
are not seen are eternal
for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands
eternal in the heavens
for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with
our house which is from heaven  if so be that being clothed we
shall not be found naked
for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not
for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might
be swallowed up of life
now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who
also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit
therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at
home in the body we are absent from the lord  for we walk by
faith not by sight  we are confident i say and willing rather
to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord
wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be
accepted of him
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that
every one may receive the things done in his body according to that
he hath done whether it be good or bad
knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we
are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your
consciences
for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you
occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer
them which glory in appearance and not in heart
for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we
be sober it is for your cause
for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge
that if one died for all then were all dead  and that he died
for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto
themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again
wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though
we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him
no more
therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old
things are passed away behold all things are become new
and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by
jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation
to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto
himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed
unto us the word of reconciliation
now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech
you by us we pray you in christs stead be ye reconciled to god
for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we
might be made the righteousness of god in him
we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye
receive not the grace of god in vain
for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the
day of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the accepted
time behold now is the day of salvation   giving no offence in
any thing that the ministry be not blamed  but in all things
approving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience in
afflictions in necessities in distresses  in stripes in
imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings
by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy
ghost by love unfeigned  by the word of truth by the power of
god by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left
by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as
deceivers and yet true  as unknown and yet well known as dying
and behold we live as chastened and not killed  as sorrowful
yet alway rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing
and yet possessing all things
o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is
enlarged
ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own
bowels
now for a recompence in the same i speak as unto my children
be ye also enlarged
be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what
fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion
hath light with darkness   and what concord hath christ with
belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel   and
what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the
temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and
walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people
wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the
lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you
and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and
daughters saith the lord almighty
having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting
holiness in the fear of god
receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we
have defrauded no man
i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that ye
are in our hearts to die and live with you
great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of
you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our
tribulation
for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but
we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were
fears
nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down
comforted us by the coming of titus  and not by his coming only
but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told
us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so
that i rejoiced the more
for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though
i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you
sorry though it were but for a season
now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed
to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye
might receive damage by us in nothing
for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death
for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly
sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of
yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement
desire yea what zeal yea what revenge in all things ye have
approved yourselves to be clear in this matter
wherefore though i wrote unto you i did it not for his cause
that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but
that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you
therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly
the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit was
refreshed by you all
for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamed
but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting
which i made before titus is found a truth
and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he
remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye
received him
i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all things
moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed
on the churches of macedonia  how that in a great trial of
affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded
unto the riches of their liberality
for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power
they were willing of themselves  praying us with much intreaty
that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the
ministering to the saints
and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own
selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god
insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so he would
also finish in you the same grace also
therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance
and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that
ye abound in this grace also
i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of
others and to prove the sincerity of your love
for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he
was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his
poverty might be rich
and herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who
have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago
now therefore perform the doing of it that as there was a
readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that
which ye have
for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to
that a man hath and not according to that he hath not
for i mean not that other men be eased and ye burdened  but
by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply
for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your
want that there may be equality  as it is written he that had
gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had no
lack
but thanks be to god which put the same earnest care into the
heart of titus for you
for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward
of his own accord he went unto you
and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the
gospel throughout all the churches  and not that only but who
was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace
which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and
declaration of your ready mind  avoiding this that no man should
blame us in this abundance which is administered by us  providing
for honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also in the
sight of men
and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes
proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the
great confidence which i have in you
whether any do enquire of titus he is my partner and
fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be enquired of they are
the messengers of the churches and the glory of christ
wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of
your love and of our boasting on your behalf
for as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous
for me to write to you  for i know the forwardness of your mind
for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a
year ago and your zeal hath provoked very many
yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be
in vain in this behalf that as i said ye may be ready  lest
haply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we
that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident
boasting
therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they
would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof
ye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter of
bounty and not as of covetousness
but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also
sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also
bountifully
every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give
not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver
and god is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye
always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good
work  as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given
to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever
now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for
your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of
your righteousness  being enriched in every thing to all
bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god
for the administration of this service not only supplieth the
want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto
god  whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify
god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ and for
your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men  and by
their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of
god in you
thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift
now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of
christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold
toward you  but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am
present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against
some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh
for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh
for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty
through god to the pulling down of strong holds  casting down
imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the
knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the
obedience of christ  and having in a readiness to revenge all
disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled
do ye look on things after the outward appearance if any man
trust to himself that he is christs let him of himself think this
again that as he is christs even so are we christs
for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which
the lord hath given us for edification and not for your destruction
i should not be ashamed  that i may not seem as if i would
terrify you by letters
for his letters say they are weighty and powerful but his
bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible
let such an one think this that such as we are in word by
letters when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we are
present
for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare
ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring
themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves
are not wise
but we will not boast of things without our measure but
according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us
a measure to reach even unto you
for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we
reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in
preaching the gospel of christ  not boasting of things without
our measure that is of other mens labours but having hope when
your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to
our rule abundantly  to preach the gospel in the regions beyond
you and not to boast in another mans line of things made ready to
our hand
but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord
for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the
lord commendeth
would to god ye could bear with me a little in my folly and
indeed bear with me
for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have
espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin
to christ
but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve
through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the
simplicity that is in christ
for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not
preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received
or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with
him
for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles
but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have
been throughly made manifest among you in all things
have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be
exalted because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely
i robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service
and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to
no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from
macedonia supplied and in all things i have kept myself from being
burdensome unto you and so will i keep myself
as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of this
boasting in the regions of achaia
wherefore because i love you not god knoweth
but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from
them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found
even as we
for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming
themselves into the apostles of christ
and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of
light
therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be
transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be
according to their works
i say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a
fool receive me that i may boast myself a little
that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it
were foolishly in this confidence of boasting
seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also
for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise
for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour
you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you
on the face
i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak
howbeit whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly i am bold
also
are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are
they the seed of abraham so am i
are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more in
labours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more
frequent in deaths oft
of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one
thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i
suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep
in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in
perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in
the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils
among false brethren  in weariness and painfulness in watchings
often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness
beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me
daily the care of all the churches
who is weak and i am not weak who is offended and i burn not
if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern
mine infirmities
the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed
for evermore knoweth that i lie not
in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of
the damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me  and
through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped
his hands
it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come to
visions and revelations of the lord
i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the
body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god
knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven
and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body
i cannot tell god knoweth  how that he was caught up into
paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a
man to utter
of such an one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but
in mine infirmities
for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i
will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me
above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me
and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance
of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the
messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above
measure
for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart
from me
and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my
strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i
rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon
me
therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in
necessities in persecutions in distresses for christs sake for
when i am weak then am i strong
i am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for i
ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am i behind the
very chiefest apostles though i be nothing
truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all
patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds
for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches
except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you forgive me this
wrong
behold the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not
be burdensome to you for i seek not yours but you for the children
ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children
and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the
more abundantly i love you the less i be loved
but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless being crafty
i caught you with guile
did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you
i desired titus and with him i sent a brother did titus make a
gain of you walked we not in the same spirit walked we not in the
same steps   again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you
we speak before god in christ but we do all things dearly beloved
for your edifying
for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i
would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest
there be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings
swellings tumults  and lest when i come again my god will
humble me among you and that i shall bewail many which have sinned
already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and
lasciviousness which they have committed
this is the third time i am coming to you in the mouth of two or
three witnesses shall every word be established
i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the
second time and being absent now i write to them which heretofore
have sinned and to all other that if i come again i will not
spare  since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me which to
youward is not weak but is mighty in you
for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by
the power of god for we also are weak in him but we shall live with
him by the power of god toward you
examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own
selves know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you
except ye be reprobates   but i trust that ye shall know that we
are not reprobates
now i pray to god that ye do no evil not that we should appear
approved but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as
reprobates
for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth
for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this
also we wish even your perfection
therefore i write these things being absent lest being present
i should use sharpness according to the power which the lord hath
given me to edification and not to destruction
finally brethren farewell be perfect be of good comfort be
of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be
with you
greet one another with an holy kiss
all the saints salute you
the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the
communion of the holy ghost be with you all amen
the epistle of paul the apostle to the galatians
paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus
christ and god the father who raised him from the dead  and all
the brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia
grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus
christ  who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us
from this present evil world according to the will of god and our
father  to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into
the grace of christ unto another gospel  which is not another but
there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of
christ
but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel
unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be
accursed
as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other
gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed
for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men
for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ
but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached
of me is not after man
for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by
the revelation of jesus christ
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews
religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and
wasted it  and profited in the jews religion above many my
equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the
traditions of my fathers
but when it pleased god who separated me from my mothers womb
and called me by his grace  to reveal his son in me that i might
preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh
and blood  neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were
apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto
damascus
then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and
abode with him fifteen days
but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lords
brother
now the things which i write unto you behold before god i lie
not
afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia  and
was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ
but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times
past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed
and they glorified god in me
then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with
barnabas and took titus with me also
and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that
gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which
were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in
vain
but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled
to be circumcised  and that because of false brethren unawares
brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have
in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage  to whom we
gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the
gospel might continue with you
but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it
maketh no matter to me god accepteth no mans person for they who
seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me  but
contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was
committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter
for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of
the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles
and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived
the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the
right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and
they unto the circumcision
only they would that we should remember the poor the same which
i also was forward to do
but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face
because he was to be blamed
for before that certain came from james he did eat with the
gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself
fearing them which were of the circumcision
and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that
barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation
but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the
truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being
a jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews
why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews   we who
are jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles  knowing that
a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of
jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be
justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for
by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified
but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves
also are found sinners is therefore christ the minister of sin god
forbid
for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself
a transgressor
for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto
god
i am crucified with christ neverthless i live yet not i but
christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live
by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by
the law then christ is dead in vain
o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not
obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set
forth crucified among you   this only would i learn of you
received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of
faith   are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now
made perfect by the flesh   have ye suffered so many things in
vain if it be yet in vain
he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh
miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the
hearing of faith   even as abraham believed god and it was
accounted to him for righteousness
know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the
children of abraham
and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen
through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in
thee shall all nations be blessed
so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse
for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all
things which are written in the book of the law to do them
but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it
is evident for the just shall live by faith
and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall
live in them
christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a
curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a
tree  that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles
through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit
through faith
brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a
mans covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth
thereto
now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not
and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is
christ
and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of
god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after
cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect
for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise
but god gave it to abraham by promise
wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of
transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was
made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator
now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one
is the law then against the promises of god god forbid for if
there had been a law given which could have given life verily
righteousness should have been by the law
but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise
by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe
but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto
the faith which should afterwards be revealed
wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ
that we might be justified by faith
but after that faith is come we are no longer under a
schoolmaster
for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on
christ
there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free
there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus
and if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirs
according to the promise
now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth
nothing from a servant though he be lord of all  but is under
tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father
even so we when we were children were in bondage under the
elements of the world  but when the fulness of the time was come
god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law  to
redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the
adoption of sons
and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son
into your hearts crying abba father
wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son
then an heir of god through christ
howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did service unto them which
by nature are no gods
but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of god
how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye
desire again to be in bondage   ye observe days and months and
times and years
i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain
brethren i beseech you be as i am for i am as ye are ye have
not injured me at all
ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel
unto you at the first
and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor
rejected but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus
where is then the blessedness ye spake of for i bear you record
that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own
eyes and have given them to me
am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth
they zealously affect you but not well yea they would exclude
you that ye might affect them
but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing
and not only when i am present with you
my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ
be formed in you  i desire to be present with you now and to
change my voice for i stand in doubt of you
tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the
law   for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a
bondmaid the other by a freewoman
but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he
of the freewoman was by promise
which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants
the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is
agar
for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to
jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children
but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us
all
for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not break
forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many
more children than she which hath an husband
now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise
but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
was born after the spirit even so it is now
nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and
her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son
of the freewoman
so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of
the free
stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us
free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage
behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christ
shall profit you nothing
for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a
debtor to do the whole law
christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are
justified by the law ye are fallen from grace
for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by
faith
for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor
uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love
ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the
truth   this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you
a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
i have confidence in you through the lord that ye will be none
otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment
whosoever he be
and i brethren if i yet preach circumcision why do i yet
suffer persecution then is the offence of the cross ceased
i would they were even cut off which trouble you
for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not
liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another
for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not
consumed one of another
this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the
lust of the flesh
for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against
the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye
cannot do the things that ye would
but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law
now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these
adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness  idolatry
witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions
heresies  envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such
like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time
past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of
god
but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering
gentleness goodness faith  meekness temperance against such
there is no law
and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the
affections and lusts
if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit
let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another
envying one another
brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are
spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering
thyself lest thou also be tempted
bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ
for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he
deceiveth himself
but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have
rejoicing in himself alone and not in another
for every man shall bear his own burden
let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that
teacheth in all good things
be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth
that shall he also reap
for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap
life everlasting
and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall
reap if we faint not
as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men
especially unto them who are of the household of faith
ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own
hand
as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they
constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer
persecution for the cross of christ
for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but
desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh
but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord
jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the
world
for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor
uncircumcision but a new creature
and as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and
mercy and upon the israel of god
from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the
marks of the lord jesus
brethren the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit
amen
the epistle of paul the apostle to the ephesians
paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the
saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus
grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord
jesus christ
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ
according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the
world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love
having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus
christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will  to
the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted
in the beloved
in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of
sins according to the riches of his grace  wherein he hath
abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence  having made known
unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which
he hath purposed in himself  that in the dispensation of the
fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ
both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him  in
whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated
according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the
counsel of his own will  that we should be to the praise of his
glory who first trusted in christ
in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth
the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye
were sealed with that holy spirit of promise  which is the
earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased
possession unto the praise of his glory
wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus
and love unto all the saints  cease not to give thanks for you
making mention of you in my prayers  that the god of our lord
jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of
wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him  the eyes of your
understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of
his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in
the saints  and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to
usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power
which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and
set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places  far above
all principality and power and might and dominion and every name
that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to
come  and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be
the head over all things to the church  which is his body the
fulness of him that filleth all in all
and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins
wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this
world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit
that now worketh in the children of disobedience  among whom also
we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by
nature the children of wrath even as others
but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he
loved us  even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us
together with christ by grace ye are saved  and hath raised us
up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ
jesus  that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches
of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus
for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of
yourselves it is the gift of god  not of works lest any man
should boast
for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good
works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them
wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in the
flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the
circumcision in the flesh made by hands  that at that time ye
were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and
strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without
god in the world  but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were
far off are made nigh by the blood of christ
for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down
the middle wall of partition between us  having abolished in his
flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in
ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making
peace  and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by
the cross having slain the enmity thereby  and came and preached
peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh
for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the
father
now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but
fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god  and
are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus
christ himself being the chief corner stone  in whom all the
building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the
lord  in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of
god through the spirit
for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you
gentiles  if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god
which is given me to youward  how that by revelation he made
known unto me the mystery as i wrote afore in few words
whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery
of christ  which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of
men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the
spirit  that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same
body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel
whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of
god given unto me by the effectual working of his power
unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace
given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches
of christ  and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the
mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god
who created all things by jesus christ  to the intent that now
unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known
by the church the manifold wisdom of god  according to the
eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord  in
whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him
wherefore i desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you
which is your glory
for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus
christ  of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named
that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to
be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man  that
christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
grounded in love  may be able to comprehend with all saints what
is the breadth and length and depth and height  and to know
the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled
with all the fulness of god
now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us
unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages
world without end amen
i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk
worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called  with all lowliness
and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love
endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one
hope of your calling  one lord one faith one baptism  one
god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you
all
but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure
of the gift of christ
wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity
captive and gave gifts unto men
now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first
into the lower parts of the earth   he that descended is the same
also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all
things   and he gave some apostles and some prophets and
some evangelists and some pastors and teachers  for the
perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the
edifying of the body of christ  till we all come in the unity of
the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ  that we
henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about
with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning
craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive  but speaking the
truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head
even christ  from whom the whole body fitly joined together and
compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the
effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the
body unto the edifying of itself in love
this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth
walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind
having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of
god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of
their heart  who being past feeling have given themselves over
unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness
but ye have not so learned christ  if so be that ye have
heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus
that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which
is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts  and be renewed in
the spirit of your mind  and that ye put on the new man which
after god is created in righteousness and true holiness
wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his
neighbour for we are members one of another
be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your
wrath  neither give place to the devil
let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour
working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to
give to him that needeth
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that
which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto
the hearers
and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto
the day of redemption
let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil
speaking be put away from you with all malice  and be ye kind
one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for
christs sake hath forgiven you
be ye therefore followers of god as dear children  and walk
in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us
an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour
but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not
be once named among you as becometh saints  neither filthiness
nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather
giving of thanks
for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor
covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom
of christ and of god
let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these
things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience
be not ye therefore partakers with them
for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord
walk as children of light  for the fruit of the spirit is in all
goodness and righteousness and truth  proving what is acceptable
unto the lord
and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but
rather reprove them
for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of
them in secret
but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light
for whatsoever doth make manifest is light
wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the
dead and christ shall give thee light
see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise
redeeming the time because the days are evil
wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of
the lord is
and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with
the spirit  speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord
giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in
the name of our lord jesus christ  submitting yourselves one to
another in the fear of god
wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the
lord
for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the
head of the church and he is the saviour of the body
therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives
be to their own husbands in every thing
husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church
and gave himself for it  that he might sanctify and cleanse it
with the washing of water by the word  that he might present it
to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such
thing but that it should be holy and without blemish
so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that
loveth his wife loveth himself
for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and
cherisheth it even as the lord the church  for we are members of
his body of his flesh and of his bones
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall
be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh
this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the
church
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife
even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband
children obey your parents in the lord for this is right
honour thy father and mother which is the first commandment with
promise  that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long
on the earth
and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring
them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord
servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to
the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as
unto christ  not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the
servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart  with
good will doing service as to the lord and not to men  knowing
that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of
the lord whether he be bond or free
and ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing
threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is
there respect of persons with him
finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of
his might
put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil
for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against
principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of
this world against spiritual wickedness in high places
wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be
able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand
stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and
having on the breastplate of righteousness  and your feet shod
with the preparation of the gospel of peace  above all taking
the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the
fiery darts of the wicked
and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit
which is the word of god  praying always with all prayer and
supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all
perseverance and supplication for all saints  and for me that
utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to
make known the mystery of the gospel  for which i am an
ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to
speak
but that ye also may know my affairs and how i do tychicus a
beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known to
you all things  whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose
that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts
peace be to the brethren and love with faith from god the
father and the lord jesus christ
grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ in
sincerity
amen
the epistle of paul the apostle to the philippians
paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ to all the
saints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and
deacons  grace be unto you and peace from god our father and
from the lord jesus christ
i thank my god upon every remembrance of you  always in every
prayer of mine for you all making request with joy  for your
fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now  being
confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in
you will perform it until the day of jesus christ  even as it is
meet for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart
inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of
the gospel ye all are partakers of my grace
for god is my record how greatly i long after you all in the
bowels of jesus christ
and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in
knowledge and in all judgment  that ye may approve things that
are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day
of christ
being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus
christ unto the glory and praise of god
but i would ye should understand brethren that the things which
happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the
gospel  so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the
palace and in all other places  and many of the brethren in the
lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the
word without fear
some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also
of good will  the one preach christ of contention not sincerely
supposing to add affliction to my bonds  but the other of love
knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel
what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in
truth christ is preached and i therein do rejoice yea and will
rejoice
for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your
prayer and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ  according
to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall be
ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also christ
shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death
for to me to live is christ and to die is gain
but if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labour yet
what i shall choose i wot not
for i am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and
to be with christ which is far better  nevertheless to abide in
the flesh is more needful for you
and having this confidence i know that i shall abide and
continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith  that
your rejoicing may be more abundant in jesus christ for me by my
coming to you again
only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of
christ that whether i come and see you or else be absent i may hear
of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind
striving together for the faith of the gospel  and in nothing
terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of
perdition but to you of salvation and that of god
for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to
believe on him but also to suffer for his sake  having the same
conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me
if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of
love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies
fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being
of one accord of one mind
let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness
of mind let each esteem other better than themselves
look not every man on his own things but every man also on the
things of others
let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus  who
being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god
but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a
servant and was made in the likeness of men  and being found in
fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death
even the death of the cross
wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name
which is above every name  that at the name of jesus every knee
should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under
the earth  and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ
is lord to the glory of god the father
wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my
presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling
for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his
good pleasure
do all things without murmurings and disputings  that ye may
be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the
midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights
in the world  holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice
in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither laboured in
vain
yea and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your
faith i joy and rejoice with you all
for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me
but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you
that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state
for i have no man likeminded who will naturally care for your
state
for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christs
but ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father he
hath served with me in the gospel
him therefore i hope to send presently so soon as i shall see
how it will go with me
but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly
yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my
brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but your
messenger and he that ministered to my wants
for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because
that ye had heard that he had been sick
for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but god had mercy on him
and not on him only but on me also lest i should have sorrow upon
sorrow
i sent him therefore the more carefully that when ye see him
again ye may rejoice and that i may be the less sorrowful
receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness and hold
such in reputation  because for the work of christ he was nigh
unto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service
toward me
finally my brethren rejoice in the lord to write the same
things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe
beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision
for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and
rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh
though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man
thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more
circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of
benjamin an hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law a pharisee
concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the
righteousness which is in the law blameless
but what things were gain to me those i counted loss for christ
yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency
of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the
loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ
and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is
of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the
righteousness which is of god by faith  that i may know him and
the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings
being made conformable unto his death  if by any means i might
attain unto the resurrection of the dead
not as though i had already attained either were already
perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which
also i am apprehended of christ jesus
brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one
thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching
forth unto those things which are before  i press toward the mark
for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus
let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if
in any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto
you
nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by
the same rule let us mind the same thing
brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk
so as ye have us for an ensample
for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you
even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ
whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is
in their shame who mind earthly things   for our conversation
is in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour the lord jesus
christ  who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned
like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is
able even to subdue all things unto himself
therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and
crown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved
i beseech euodias and beseech syntyche that they be of the same
mind in the lord
and i intreat thee also true yokefellow help those women which
laboured with me in the gospel with clement also and with other my
fellowlabourers whose names are in the book of life
rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice
let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand
be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto
god
and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep
your hearts and minds through christ jesus
finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things
are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure
whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if
there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these
things
those things which ye have both learned and received and heard
and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you
but i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at the last your
care of me hath flourished again wherein ye were also careful but ye
lacked opportunity
not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in
whatsoever state i am therewith to be content
i know both how to be abased and i know how to abound every
where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be
hungry both to abound and to suffer need
i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me
notwithstanding ye have well done that ye did communicate with
my affliction
now ye philippians know also that in the beginning of the
gospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with me
as concerning giving and receiving but ye only
for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my
necessity
not because i desire a gift but i desire fruit that may abound
to your account
but i have all and abound i am full having received of
epaphroditus the things which were sent from you an odour of a sweet
smell a sacrifice acceptable wellpleasing to god
but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in
glory by christ jesus
now unto god and our father be glory for ever and ever amen
salute every saint in christ jesus the brethren which are with
me greet you
all the saints salute you chiefly they that are of caesars
household
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
the epistle of paul the apostle to the colossians
paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god
and timotheus our brother   to the saints and faithful brethren
in christ which are at colosse grace be unto you and peace
from god our father and the lord jesus christ
we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying
always for you
since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which ye
have to all the saints
for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard
before in the word of the truth of the gospel
which is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth
fruit as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew the
grace of god in truth
as ye also learned of epaphras our dear fellowservant who is for you
a faithful minister of christ
who also declared unto us your love in the spirit
for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to
pray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his
will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding
that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being
fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god
strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto
all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness
giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be
partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light
who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated
us into the kingdom of his dear son
in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of
sins
who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every
creature
for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are
in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or
principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him
and he is before all things and by him all things consist
and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the
firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence
for it pleased the father that in him should all fulness dwell
and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to
reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in
earth or things in heaven
and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by
wicked works yet now hath he reconciled
in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and
unblameable and unreproveable in his sight
if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved
away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached
to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul am made a minister
who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is
behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his bodys sake which is
the church
whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god
which is given to me for you to fulfil the word of god
even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations
but now is made manifest to his saints
to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this
mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory
whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all
wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus
whereunto i also labour striving according to his working which
worketh in me mightily
for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for
them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh
that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and
unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the
acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ
in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words
for though i be absent in the flesh yet am i with you in the spirit
joying and beholding your order and the stedfastness of your faith in
christ
as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in
him
rooted and built up in him and stablished in the faith as ye have
been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving
beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit
after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after
christ
for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily
and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and
power
in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without
hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision
of christ
buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him
through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead
and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your
flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all
trespasses
blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which
was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross
and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a shew of them
openly triumphing over them in it
let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of
an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days
which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ
let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and
worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen
vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
and not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands
having nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with the
increase of god
wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world
why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances
touch not taste not handle not
which all are to perish with the using after the commandments and
doctrines of men
which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship and
humility and neglecting of the body not in any honour to the satisfying
of the flesh
if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above
where christ sitteth on the right hand of god
set your affection on things above not on things on the earth
for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god
when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear
with him in glory
mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication
uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness
which is idolatry
for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of
disobedience
in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them
but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy
filthy communication out of your mouth
lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with
his deeds
and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the
image of him that created him
where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor
uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free but christ is all and in
all
put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of
mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering
forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a
quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye
and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of
perfectness
and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye
are called in one body and be ye thankful
let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching
and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing
with grace in your hearts to the lord
and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord
jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him
wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the
lord
husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them
children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing
unto the lord
fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be
discouraged
servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not
with eyeservice as menpleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god
and whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto
men
knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the
inheritance for ye serve the lord christ
but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath
done and there is no respect of persons
masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing
that ye also have a master in heaven
continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving
withal praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of
utterance to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds
that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak
walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time
let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt that ye may
know how ye ought to answer every man
all my state shall tychicus declare unto you who is a beloved
brother and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the lord
whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that he might know
your estate and comfort your hearts
with onesimus a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you they
shall make known unto you all things which are done here
aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you and marcus sisters son
to barnabas touching whom ye received commandments if he come unto you
receive him
and jesus which is called justus who are of the circumcision these
only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of god which have been a comfort
unto me
epaphras who is one of you a servant of christ saluteth you
always labouring fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and
complete in all the will of god
for i bear him record that he hath a great zeal for you and them
that are in laodicea and them in hierapolis
luke the beloved physician and demas greet you
salute the brethren which are in laodicea and nymphas and the
church which is in his house
and when this epistle is read among you cause that it be read also
in the church of the laodiceans and that ye likewise read the epistle from
laodicea
and say to archippus take heed to the ministry which thou hast
received in the lord that thou fulfil it
the salutation by the hand of me paul remember my bonds grace be
with you amen
the first epistle of paul the apostle to the thessalonians
paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the
thessalonians which is in god the father and in the lord jesus christ
grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus
christ
we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in
our prayers  remembering without ceasing your work of faith and
labour of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in the
sight of god and our father  knowing brethren beloved your
election of god
for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power
and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as ye know what manner
of men we were among you for your sake
and ye became followers of us and of the lord having received
the word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost
so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and
achaia
for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in
macedonia and achaia but also in every place your faith to godward
is spread abroad so that we need not to speak any thing
for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had
unto you and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and
true god  and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised
from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come
for yourselves brethren know our entrance in unto you that it
was not in vain  but even after that we had suffered before and
were shamefully entreated as ye know at philippi we were bold in
our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention
for our exhortation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor in
guile  but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the
gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but god which trieth
our hearts
for neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know nor
a cloke of covetousness god is witness  nor of men sought we
glory neither of you nor yet of others when we might have been
burdensome as the apostles of christ
but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherisheth her
children  so being affectionately desirous of you we were willing
to have imparted unto you not the gospel of god only but also our
own souls because ye were dear unto us
for ye remember brethren our labour and travail for labouring
night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we
preached unto you the gospel of god
ye are witnesses and god also how holily and justly and
unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe  as ye
know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a
father doth his children  that ye would walk worthy of god who
hath called you unto his kingdom and glory
for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when
ye received the word of god which ye heard of us ye received it not
as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which
effectually worketh also in you that believe
for ye brethren became followers of the churches of god which
in judaea are in christ jesus for ye also have suffered like things
of your own countrymen even as they have of the jews  who both
killed the lord jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us
and they please not god and are contrary to all men  forbidding
us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved to fill up their
sins alway for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost
but we brethren being taken from you for a short time in
presence not in heart endeavoured the more abundantly to see your
face with great desire
wherefore we would have come unto you even i paul once and
again but satan hindered us
for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing are not even
ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming   for
ye are our glory and joy
wherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to
be left at athens alone  and sent timotheus our brother and
minister of god and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of christ to
establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith  that no
man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we
are appointed thereunto
for verily when we were with you we told you before that we
should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass and ye know
for this cause when i could no longer forbear i sent to know
your faith lest by some means the tempter have tempted you and our
labour be in vain
but now when timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good
tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance
of us always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you
therefore brethren we were comforted over you in all our affliction
and distress by your faith  for now we live if ye stand fast in
the lord
for what thanks can we render to god again for you for all the
joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god  night and day
praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect
that which is lacking in your faith   now god himself and our
father and our lord jesus christ direct our way unto you
and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
another and toward all men even as we do toward you  to the end
he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god even
our father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his
saints
furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the
lord jesus that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to
please god so ye would abound more and more
for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus
for this is the will of god even your sanctification that ye
should abstain from fornication  that every one of you should know
how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour  not in the
lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which know not god
that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because
that the lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned
you and testified
for god hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness
he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but god who hath
also given unto us his holy spirit
but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto you
for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another
and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all
macedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more and
more  and that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business
and to work with your own hands as we commanded you  that ye may
walk honestly toward them that are without and that ye may have lack
of nothing
but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning
them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have
no hope
for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them
also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him
for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which
are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent
them which are asleep
for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with
the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in
christ shall rise first  then we which are alive and remain shall
be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the
air and so shall we ever be with the lord
wherefore comfort one another with these words
but of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that i
write unto you
for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh
as a thief in the night
for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction
cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall
not escape
but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should
overtake you as a thief
ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we
are not of the night nor of darkness
therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be
sober
for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken
are drunken in the night
but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the
breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of
salvation
for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by
our lord jesus christ  who died for us that whether we wake or
sleep we should live together with him
wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another
even as also ye do
and we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among
you and are over you in the lord and admonish you  and to
esteem them very highly in love for their works sake and be at peace
among yourselves
now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort
the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all men
see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow
that which is good both among yourselves and to all men
rejoice evermore
pray without ceasing
in every thing give thanks for this is the will of god in christ
jesus concerning you
quench not the spirit
despise not prophesyings
prove all things hold fast that which is good
abstain from all appearance of evil
and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly and i pray god
your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
coming of our lord jesus christ
faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it
brethren pray for us
greet all the brethren with an holy kiss
i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the
holy brethren
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen
the second epistle of paul the apostle to the thessalonians
paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the
thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ  grace
unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ
we are bound to thank god always for you brethren as it is meet
because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every
one of you all toward each other aboundeth  so that we ourselves
glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all
your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure  which is a
manifest token of the righteous judgment of god that ye may be
counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which ye also suffer
seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to
them that trouble you  and to you who are troubled rest with us
when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty
angels  in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not
god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ  who
shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of
the lord and from the glory of his power  when he shall come to
be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe
because our testimony among you was believed in that day
wherefore also we pray always for you that our god would count
you worthy of this calling and fulfil all the good pleasure of his
goodness and the work of faith with power  that the name of our
lord jesus christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to
the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ
now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus
christ and by our gathering together unto him  that ye be not
soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word
nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand
let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come
except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be
revealed the son of perdition  who opposeth and exalteth himself
above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god
sitteth in the temple of god shewing himself that he is god
remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these
things   and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be
revealed in his time
for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now
letteth will let until he be taken out of the way
and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall
consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the
brightness of his coming  even him whose coming is after the
working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders  and
with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish
because they received not the love of the truth that they might be
saved
and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they
should believe a lie  that they all might be damned who believed
not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness
but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you brethren
beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to
salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the
truth  whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of
the glory of our lord jesus christ
therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye
have been taught whether by word or our epistle
now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father
which hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and
good hope through grace  comfort your hearts and stablish you in
every good word and work
finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord may have
free course and be glorified even as it is with you  and that we
may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have
not faith
but the lord is faithful who shall stablish you and keep you
from evil
and we have confidence in the lord touching you that ye both do
and will do the things which we command you
and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god and into the
patient waiting for christ
now we command you brethren in the name of our lord jesus
christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh
disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us
for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved not
ourselves disorderly among you  neither did we eat any mans bread
for nought but wrought with labour and travail night and day that we
might not be chargeable to any of you  not because we have not
power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us
for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if
any would not work neither should he eat
for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly
working not at all but are busybodies
now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus
christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread
but ye brethren be not weary in well doing
and if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man
and have no company with him that he may be ashamed
yet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother
now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means
the lord be with you all
the salutation of paul with mine own hand which is the token in
every epistle so i write
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
the first epistle of paul the apostle to timothy
paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our
saviour and lord jesus christ which is our hope  unto timothy
my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god our father
and jesus christ our lord
as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into
macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other
doctrine  neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies
which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in
faith so do
now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and
of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned  from which some
having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling  desiring to
be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor
whereof they affirm
but we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully
knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but for
the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners for
unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers
for manslayers  for whoremongers for them that defile themselves
with mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons and if
there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine
according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which was
committed to my trust
and i thank christ jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that
he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry  who was
before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but i obtained
mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief
and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and
love which is in christ jesus
this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that
christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief
howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus
christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which
should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting
now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise
god be honour and glory for ever and ever amen
this charge i commit unto thee son timothy according to the
prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest war a
good warfare  holding faith and a good conscience which some
having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck  of whom is
hymenaeus and alexander whom i have delivered unto satan that they
may learn not to blaspheme
i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers
intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men  for
kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and
peaceable life in all godliness and honesty
for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour
who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge
of the truth
for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the
man christ jesus  who gave himself a ransom for all to be
testified in due time
whereunto i am ordained a preacher and an apostle i speak the
truth in christ and lie not a teacher of the gentiles in faith and
verity
i will therefore that men pray every where lifting up holy hands
without wrath and doubting
in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest
apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or
gold or pearls or costly array  but which becometh women
professing godliness with good works
let the woman learn in silence with all subjection
but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over
the man but to be in silence
for adam was first formed then eve
and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in
the transgression
notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they
continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety
this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he
desireth a good work
a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife
vigilant sober of good behaviour given to hospitality apt to
teach  not given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucre
but patient not a brawler not covetous  one that ruleth well his
own house having his children in subjection with all gravity
for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take
care of the church of god   not a novice lest being lifted up
with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil
moreover he must have a good report of them which are without
lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil
likewise must the deacons be grave not doubletongued not given
to much wine not greedy of filthy lucre  holding the mystery of
the faith in a pure conscience
and let these also first be proved then let them use the office
of a deacon being found blameless
even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober
faithful in all things
let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their
children and their own houses well
for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to
themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in
christ jesus
these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly
but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living
god the pillar and ground of the truth
and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god
was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels
preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into
glory
now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some
shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and
doctrines of devils  speaking lies in hypocrisy having their
conscience seared with a hot iron  forbidding to marry and
commanding to abstain from meats which god hath created to be
received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth
for every creature of god is good and nothing to be refused if
it be received with thanksgiving  for it is sanctified by the word
of god and prayer
if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thou
shalt be a good minister of jesus christ nourished up in the words of
faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attained
but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself
rather unto godliness
for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable
unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that
which is to come
this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation
for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we
trust in the living god who is the saviour of all men specially of
those that believe
these things command and teach
let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the
believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith
in purity
till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to
doctrine
neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by
prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery
meditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them that thy
profiting may appear to all
take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them
for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear
thee
rebuke not an elder but intreat him as a father and the younger
men as brethren  the elder women as mothers the younger as
sisters with all purity
honour widows that are widows indeed
but if any widow have children or nephews let them learn first to
shew piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and
acceptable before god
now she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in god and
continueth in supplications and prayers night and day
but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth
and these things give in charge that they may be blameless
but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his
own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel
let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years
old having been the wife of one man
well reported of for good works if she have brought up children
if she have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet if
she have relieved the afflicted if she have diligently followed every
good work
but the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to wax
wanton against christ they will marry  having damnation because
they have cast off their first faith
and withal they learn to be idle wandering about from house to
house and not only idle but tattlers also and busybodies speaking
things which they ought not
i will therefore that the younger women marry bear children
guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak
reproachfully
for some are already turned aside after satan
if any man or woman that believeth have widows let them relieve
them and let not the church be charged that it may relieve them that
are widows indeed
let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour
especially they who labour in the word and doctrine
for the scripture saith thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
treadeth out the corn and the labourer is worthy of his reward
against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or
three witnesses
them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear
i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ and the
elect angels that thou observe these things without preferring one
before another doing nothing by partiality
lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other mens
sins keep thyself pure
drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs
sake and thine often infirmities
some mens sins are open beforehand going before to judgment
and some men they follow after
likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand and
they that are otherwise cannot be hid
let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters
worthy of all honour that the name of god and his doctrine be not
blasphemed
and they that have believing masters let them not despise them
because they are brethren but rather do them service because they
are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit these things teach
and exhort
if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words
even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is
according to godliness  he is proud knowing nothing but doting
about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife
railings evil surmisings  perverse disputings of men of corrupt
minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness
from such withdraw thyself
but godliness with contentment is great gain
for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can
carry nothing out
and having food and raiment let us be therewith content
but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and
into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction
and perdition
for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some
coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves
through with many sorrows
but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after
righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness
fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life
whereunto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession
before many witnesses
i give thee charge in the sight of god who quickeneth all
things and before christ jesus who before pontius pilate witnessed a
good confession  that thou keep this commandment without spot
unrebukable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ  which
in his times he shall shew who is the blessed and only potentate the
king of kings and lord of lords  who only hath immortality
dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath
seen nor can see to whom be honour and power everlasting amen
charge them that are rich in this world that they be not
highminded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the living god who
giveth us richly all things to enjoy  that they do good that
they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to
communicate  laying up in store for themselves a good foundation
against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life
o timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding
profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so
called  which some professing have erred concerning the faith
grace be with thee amen
the second epistle of paul the apostle to timothy
paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god according to
the promise of life which is in christ jesus  to timothy
my dearly beloved son grace mercy and peace from god the father
and christ jesus our lord
i thank god whom i serve from my forefathers with pure
conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my
prayers night and day  greatly desiring to see thee being mindful
of thy tears that i may be filled with joy  when i call to
remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in
thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded that
in thee also
wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of
god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands
for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of
love and of a sound mind
be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of
me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel
according to the power of god  who hath saved us and called us
with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his
own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the
world began  but is now made manifest by the appearing of our
saviour jesus christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life
and immortality to light through the gospel  whereunto i am
appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles
for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am
not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he
is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day
hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me
in faith and love which is in christ jesus
that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy
ghost which dwelleth in us
this thou knowest that all they which are in asia be turned away
from me of whom are phygellus and hermogenes
the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus for he oft
refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain  but when he was
in rome he sought me out very diligently and found me
the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in
that day and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus
thou knowest very well
thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ
jesus
and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses
the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach
others also
thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ
no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this
life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier
and if a man also strive for masteries yet is he not crowned
except he strive lawfully
the husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
fruits
consider what i say and the lord give thee understanding in all
things
remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from
the dead according to my gospel  wherein i suffer trouble as an
evil doer even unto bonds but the word of god is not bound
therefore i endure all things for the elects sakes that they
may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal
glory
it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall
also live with him  if we suffer we shall also reign with him
if we deny him he also will deny us  if we believe not yet he
abideth faithful he cannot deny himself
of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the
lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the
subverting of the hearers
study to shew thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth
not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth
but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto
more ungodliness
and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenaeus
and philetus  who concerning the truth have erred saying that
the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some
nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this
seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let every one that
nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity
but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of
silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honour and some to
dishonour
if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel
unto honour sanctified and meet for the masters use and prepared
unto every good work
flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith
charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart
but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do
gender strifes
and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto
all men apt to teach patient  in meekness instructing those
that oppose themselves if god peradventure will give them repentance
to the acknowledging of the truth  and that they may recover
themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him
at his will
this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come
for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters
proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent
fierce despisers of those that are good  traitors heady
highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god  having a
form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away
for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead
captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts
ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth
now as jannes and jambres withstood moses so do these also resist
the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith
but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be
manifest unto all men as theirs also was
but thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose
faith longsuffering charity patience  persecutions
afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra
what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered
me
yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer
persecution
but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving
and being deceived
but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast
been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them  and that
from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to
make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus
all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable
for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in
righteousness  that the man of god may be perfect throughly
furnished unto all good works
i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who
shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom
preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove
rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine
for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine
but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers
having itching ears  and they shall turn away their ears from the
truth and shall be turned unto fables
but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of
an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry
for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is
at hand
i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept
the faith  henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at
that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his
appearing
do thy diligence to come shortly unto me  for demas hath
forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed unto
thessalonica crescens to galatia titus unto dalmatia
only luke is with me take mark and bring him with thee for he
is profitable to me for the ministry
and tychicus have i sent to ephesus
the cloke that i left at troas with carpus when thou comest
bring with thee and the books but especially the parchments
alexander the coppersmith did me much evil the lord reward him
according to his works  of whom be thou ware also for he hath
greatly withstood our words
at my first answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me

the epistle of paul the apostle to titus
paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ according
to the faith of gods elect and the acknowledging of the truth which
is after godliness  in hope of eternal life which god that
cannot lie promised before the world began  but hath in due times
manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me
according to the commandment of god our saviour  to titus mine
own son after the common faith grace mercy and peace from god the
father and the lord jesus christ our saviour
for this cause left i thee in crete that thou shouldest set in
order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as
i had appointed thee  if any be blameless the husband of one
wife having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly
for a bishop must be blameless as the steward of god not
selfwilled not soon angry not given to wine no striker not given
to filthy lucre  but a lover of hospitality a lover of good men
sober just holy temperate  holding fast the faithful word as he
hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort
and to convince the gainsayers
for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers
specially they of the circumcision  whose mouths must be stopped
who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for
filthy lucres sake
one of themselves even a prophet of their own said the
cretians are alway liars evil beasts slow bellies
this witness is true wherefore rebuke them sharply that they
may be sound in the faith  not giving heed to jewish fables and
commandments of men that turn from the truth
unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled
and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is
defiled
they profess that they know god but in works they deny him
being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate
but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine  that
the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity
in patience
the aged women likewise that they be in behaviour as becometh
holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good
things  that they may teach the young women to be sober to love
their husbands to love their children  to be discreet chaste
keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word
of god be not blasphemed
young men likewise exhort to be sober minded
in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine
shewing uncorruptness gravity sincerity  sound speech that
cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be
ashamed having no evil thing to say of you
exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to
please them well in all things not answering again  not
purloining but shewing all good fidelity that they may adorn the
doctrine of god our saviour in all things
for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
men  teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we
should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world
looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the
great god and our saviour jesus christ  who gave himself for us
that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a
peculiar people zealous of good works
these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority
let no man despise thee
put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to
obey magistrates to be ready to every good work  to speak evil of
no man to be no brawlers but gentle shewing all meekness unto all
men
for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient
deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and
envy hateful and hating one another
but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man
appeared  not by works of righteousness which we have done but
according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration
and renewing of the holy ghost  which he shed on us abundantly
through jesus christ our saviour  that being justified by his
grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life
this is a faithful saying and these things i will that thou
affirm constantly that they which have believed in god might be
careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable
unto men
but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and
strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain
a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition
reject  knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth
being condemned of himself
when i shall send artemas unto thee or tychicus be diligent to
come unto me to nicopolis for i have determined there to winter
bring zenas the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently
that nothing be wanting unto them
and let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary
uses that they be not unfruitful
all that are with me salute thee greet them that love us in the
faith grace be with you all amen
the epistle of paul the apostle to philemon
paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our brother unto
philemon our dearly beloved and fellowlabourer  and to our
beloved apphia and archippus our fellowsoldier and to the church in
thy house  grace to you and peace from god our father and the
lord jesus christ
i thank my god making mention of thee always in my prayers
hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the lord jesus
and toward all saints  that the communication of thy faith may
become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in
you in christ jesus
for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the
bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother
wherefore though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee
that which is convenient  yet for loves sake i rather beseech
thee being such an one as paul the aged and now also a prisoner of
jesus christ
i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my
bonds  which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now
profitable to thee and to me  whom i have sent again thou
therefore receive him that is mine own bowels  whom i would
have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto
me in the bonds of the gospel  but without thy mind would i do
nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but
willingly
for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou
shouldest receive him for ever  not now as a servant but above a
servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much more unto
thee both in the flesh and in the lord   if thou count me
therefore a partner receive him as myself
if he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine
account  i paul have written it with mine own hand i will repay
it albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own
self besides
yea brother let me have joy of thee in the lord refresh my
bowels in the lord
having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee knowing
that thou wilt also do more than i say
but withal prepare me also a lodging for i trust that through
your prayers i shall be given unto you
there salute thee epaphras my fellowprisoner in christ jesus
marcus aristarchus demas lucas my fellowlabourers
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen
the epistle of paul the apostle to the hebrews
god who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past
unto the fathers by the prophets  hath in these last days spoken
unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom
also he made the worlds  who being the brightness of his glory
and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the
word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on
the right hand of the majesty on high  being made so much better
than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent
name than they
for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son
this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father
and he shall be to me a son   and again when he bringeth in the
firstbegotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god
worship him
and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his
ministers a flame of fire
but unto the son he saith thy throne o god is for ever and
ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom
thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god
even thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
fellows
and thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands  they shall
perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a
garment  and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall
be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail
but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right
hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool   are they not all
ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be
heirs of salvation   therefore we ought to give the more earnest
heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let
them slip
for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast and every
transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward
how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at
the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by
them that heard him  god also bearing them witness both with
signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy
ghost according to his own will   for unto the angels hath he not
put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak
but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that
thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him
thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him
with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands
thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in that
he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put
under him
but now we see not yet all things put under him
but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for
the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the
grace of god should taste death for every man
for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all
things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their
salvation perfect through sufferings
for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all
of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren
saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the
church will i sing praise unto thee
and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and
the children which god hath given me
forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood
he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he
might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil
and deliver them who through fear of death were all their
lifetime subject to bondage
for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took
on him the seed of abraham
wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in
things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the
people
for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to
succour them that are tempted
wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling
consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus
who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was
faithful in all his house
for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses inasmuch
as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house
for every house is builded by some man but he that built all
things is god
and moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for
a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after  but
christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold
fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end
wherefore as the holy ghost saith to day if ye will hear his
voice  harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day
of temptation in the wilderness  when your fathers tempted me
proved me and saw my works forty years
wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do
alway err in their heart and they have not known my ways
so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest
take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of
unbelief in departing from the living god
but exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest any
of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin
for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of
our confidence stedfast unto the end  while it is said to day if
ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation
for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that
came out of egypt by moses
but with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with them
that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness   and to
whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them
that believed not   so we see that they could not enter in
because of unbelief
let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering
into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it
for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the
word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them
that heard it
for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i
have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the
works were finished from the foundation of the world
for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise
and god did rest the seventh day from all his works
and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest
seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and
they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief
again he limiteth a certain day saying in david to day after
so long a time as it is said to day if ye will hear his voice
harden not your hearts
for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have
spoken of another day
there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god
for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from
his own works as god did from his
let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man
fall after the same example of unbelief
for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any
twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the heart
neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight
but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we
have to do
seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into
the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession
for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we
are yet without sin
let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we
may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need
for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in
things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices
for sins  who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them
that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with
infirmity
and by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for
himself to offer for sins
and no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called
of god as was aaron
so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest
but he that said unto him thou art my son to day have i begotten
thee
as he saith also in another place thou art a priest for ever
after the order of melchisedec
who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and
supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to
save him from death and was heard in that he feared  though he
were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered
and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation
unto all them that obey him  called of god an high priest after
the order of melchisedec
of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered
seeing ye are dull of hearing
for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that
one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of
god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat
for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
righteousness for he is a babe
but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even
those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both
good and evil
therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us
go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance
from dead works and of faith toward god  of the doctrine of
baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead
and of eternal judgment
and this will we do if god permit
for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have
tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy
ghost  and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the
world to come  if they shall fall away to renew them again unto
repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh
and put him to an open shame
for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it
and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed
receiveth blessing from god  but that which beareth thorns and
briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be
burned
but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things
that accompany salvation though we thus speak
for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of
love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered
to the saints and do minister
and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to
the full assurance of hope unto the end  that ye be not slothful
but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the
promises
for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by
no greater he sware by himself  saying surely blessing i will
bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee
and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise
for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation
is to them an end of all strife
wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath
that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to
lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to
lay hold upon the hope set before us  which hope we have as an
anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into
that within the veil  whither the forerunner is for us entered
even jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of
melchisedec
for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god
who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed
him  to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by
interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of
salem which is king of peace  without father without mother
without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life
but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually
now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch
abraham gave the tenth of the spoils
and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the
office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the
people according to the law that is of their brethren though they
come out of the loins of abraham  but he whose descent is not
counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had
the promises
and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better
and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them
of whom it is witnessed that he liveth
and as i may so say levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithes
in abraham
for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedec met
him
if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for
under it the people received the law what further need was there
that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and
not be called after the order of aaron   for the priesthood being
changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law
for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar
for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda of which
tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood
and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of
melchisedec there ariseth another priest  who is made not after
the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless
life
for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of
melchisedec
for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof
for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better
hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god
and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest  for
those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him
that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art a
priest for ever after the order of melchisedec  by so much was
jesus made a surety of a better testament
and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered
to continue by reason of death  but this man because he
continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood
wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come
unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them
for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless
undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens
who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up
sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this
he did once when he offered up himself
for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the
word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is
consecrated for evermore
now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have
such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the
majesty in the heavens  a minister of the sanctuary and of the
true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man
for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices
wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to
offer
for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that
there are priests that offer gifts according to the law  who serve
unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was
admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for see
saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to
thee in the mount
but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much
also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established
upon better promises
for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no
place have been sought for the second
for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come
saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of
israel and with the house of judah  not according to the covenant
that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand
to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in
my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord
for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of
israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their
mind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and
they shall be to me a people  and they shall not teach every man
his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for
all shall know me from the least to the greatest
for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins
and their iniquities will i remember no more
in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old now
that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away
then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
service and a worldly sanctuary
for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the
candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the
sanctuary
and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the
holiest of all  which had the golden censer and the ark of the
covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot
that had manna and aarons rod that budded and the tables of the
covenant  and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the
mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularly
now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always
into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year
not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of
the people  the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the
holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first
tabernacle was yet standing  which was a figure for the time then
present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could
not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the
conscience  which stood only in meats and drinks and divers
washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of
reformation
but christ being come an high priest of good things to come by a
greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to
say not of this building  neither by the blood of goats and
calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place
having obtained eternal redemption for us
for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an
heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the
flesh  how much more shall the blood of christ who through the
eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your
conscience from dead works to serve the living god   and for this
cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death
for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first
testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal
inheritance
for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the
death of the testator
for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is
of no strength at all while the testator liveth
whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
blood
for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people
according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with
water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and
all the people  saying this is the blood of the testament which
god hath enjoined unto you
moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the
vessels of the ministry
and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and
without shedding of blood is no remission
it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the
heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things
themselves with better sacrifices than these
for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands
which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to
appear in the presence of god for us  nor yet that he should
offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place
every year with blood of others  for then must he often have
suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of
the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself
and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the
judgment  so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many
and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time
without sin unto salvation
for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the
very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they
offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect
for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that
the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of
sins
but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins
every year
for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
should take away sins
wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and
offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me  in
burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure
then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written
of me to do thy will o god
above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure
therein which are offered by the law  then said he lo i come
to do thy will o god he taketh away the first that he may establish
the second
by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the
body of jesus christ once for all
and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering
oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins
but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever
sat down on the right hand of god  from henceforth expecting
till his enemies be made his footstool
for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
sanctified
whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that
he had said before  this is the covenant that i will make with
them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their
hearts and in their minds will i write them  and their sins and
iniquities will i remember no more
now where remission of these is there is no more offering for
sin
having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest
by the blood of jesus  by a new and living way which he hath
consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh
and having an high priest over the house of god  let us draw
near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts
sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure
water
let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering
for he is faithful that promised  and let us consider one
another to provoke unto love and to good works  not forsaking
the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but
exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day
approaching
for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge
of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins  but a
certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which
shall devour the adversaries
he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or
three witnesses  of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall
he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and
hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified
an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace
for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me i
will recompense saith the lord and again the lord shall judge his
people
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were
illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions  partly
whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions
and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used
for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the
spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a
better and an enduring substance
cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great
recompence of reward
for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will
of god ye might receive the promise
for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and
will not tarry
now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my
soul shall have no pleasure in him
but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them
that believe to the saving of the soul
now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of
things not seen
for by it the elders obtained a good report
through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things
which do appear
by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than
cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god
testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh
by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and
was not found because god had translated him for before his
translation he had this testimony that he pleased god
but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that
cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of
them that diligently seek him
by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet
moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the
which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness
which is by faith
by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which
he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out
not knowing whither he went
by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange
country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with
him of the same promise  for he looked for a city which hath
foundations whose builder and maker is god
through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive
seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she
judged him faithful who had promised
therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so
many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by
the sea shore innumerable
these all died in faith not having received the promises but
having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced
them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth
for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
country
and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence
they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned
but now they desire a better country that is an heavenly
wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath
prepared for them a city
by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he
that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son
of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called
accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from
whence also he received him in a figure
by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come
by faith jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of
joseph and worshipped leaning upon the top of his staff
by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing of
the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones
by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his
parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not
afraid of the kings commandment
by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called
the son of pharaohs daughter  choosing rather to suffer
affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
for a season  esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches
than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of
the reward
by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king
for he endured as seeing him who is invisible
through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood
lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them
by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land which
the egyptians assaying to do were drowned
by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were
compassed about seven days
by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed
not when she had received the spies with peace
and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of
gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae of david also
and samuel and of the prophets  who through faith subdued
kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths
of lions
quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword
out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to
flight the armies of the aliens
women received their dead raised to life again and others were
tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better
resurrection  and others had trial of cruel mockings and
scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment  they were
stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the
sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being
destitute afflicted tormented  of whom the world was not
worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and
caves of the earth
and these all having obtained a good report through faith
received not the promise  god having provided some better thing
for us that they without us should not be made perfect
wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which
doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is
set before us  looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our
faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross
despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne
of god
for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds
ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin
and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as
unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord
nor faint when thou art rebuked of him  for whom the lord loveth
he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth
if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for
what son is he whom the father chasteneth not   but if ye be
without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards
and not sons
furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us
and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection
unto the father of spirits and live   for they verily for a few
days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit
that we might be partakers of his holiness
now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but
grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby
wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble
knees  and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is
lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed
follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man
shall see the lord  looking diligently lest any man fail of the
grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you
and thereby many be defiled  lest there be any fornicator or
profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his
birthright
for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the
blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though
he sought it carefully with tears
for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and
that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest
and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice
they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them
any more  for they could not endure that which was commanded
and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or
thrust through with a dart  and so terrible was the sight that
moses said i exceedingly fear and quake  but ye are come unto
mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly
jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels  to the
general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in
heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men
made perfect  and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and
to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of
abel
see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped
not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we
escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven
whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying
yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven
and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those
things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things
which cannot be shaken may remain
wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us
have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and
godly fear  for our god is a consuming fire
let brotherly love continue
be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have
entertained angels unawares
remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them
which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body
marriage is honourable in all and the bed undefiled but
whoremongers and adulterers god will judge
let your conversation be without covetousness and be content
with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave
thee nor forsake thee
so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not
fear what man shall do unto me
remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto
you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their
conversation
jesus christ the same yesterday and to day and for ever
be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it is
a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats
which have not profited them that have been occupied therein
we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve
the tabernacle
for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the
sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp
wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his
own blood suffered without the gate
let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his
reproach
for here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come
by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god
continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name
but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such
sacrifices god is well pleased
obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves
for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that
they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable
for you
pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience in all
things willing to live honestly
but i beseech you the rather to do this that i may be restored
to you the sooner
now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord
jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the
everlasting covenant  make you perfect in every good work to do
his will working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight
through jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever amen
and i beseech you brethren suffer the word of exhortation for
i have written a letter unto you in few words
know ye that our brother timothy is set at liberty with whom
if he come shortly i will see you
salute all them that have the rule over you and all the saints
they of italy salute you
grace be with you all amen
the general epistle of james
james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ
to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting
my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers
temptations  knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh
patience
but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and
entire wanting nothing
if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all
men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him
but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth
is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed
for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the
lord
a double minded man is unstable in all his ways
let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted
but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the
grass he shall pass away
for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it
withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of
the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in
his ways
blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is
tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath
promised to them that love him
let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god
cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man  but
every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and
enticed
then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin
when it is finished bringeth forth death
do not err my beloved brethren
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh
down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither
shadow of turning
of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we
should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures
wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear
slow to speak slow to wrath  for the wrath of man worketh not
the righteousness of god
wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is
able to save your souls
but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your
own selves
for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like
unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass  for he
beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what
manner of man he was
but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth
therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this
man shall be blessed in his deed
if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his
tongue but deceiveth his own heart this mans religion is vain
pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep
himself unspotted from the world
my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord
of glory with respect of persons
for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in
goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment
and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto
him sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou
there or sit here under my footstool  are ye not then partial in
yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts   hearken my
beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in
faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that
love him   but ye have despised the poor do not rich men oppress
you and draw you before the judgment seats   do not they
blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called   if ye
fulfil the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself ye do well  but if ye have respect to
persons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors
for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one
point he is guilty of all
for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill
now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a
transgressor of the law
so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law
of liberty
for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no
mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment
what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith
and have not works can faith save him   if a brother or sister
be naked and destitute of daily food  and one of you say unto
them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye
give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it
profit   even so faith if it hath not works is dead being
alone
yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me
thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my
works
thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils
also believe and tremble
but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead
was not abraham our father justified by works when he had
offered isaac his son upon the altar   seest thou how faith
wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect   and
the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it
was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend
of god
ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by
faith only
likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when
she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way
for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without
works is dead also
my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive
the greater condemnation
for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in word
the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body
behold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey us
and we turn about their whole body
behold also the ships which though they be so great and are
driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small
helm whithersoever the governor listeth
even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things
behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth   and the tongue
is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members
that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of
nature and it is set on fire of hell
for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of
things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind  but
the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly
poison
therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse we
men which are made after the similitude of god
out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my
brethren these things ought not so to be
doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
bitter   can the fig tree my brethren bear olive berries
either a vine figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and
fresh
who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him
shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom
but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory
not and lie not against the truth
this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual
devilish
for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every
evil work
but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable
gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits
without partiality and without hypocrisy
and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make
peace
from whence come wars and fightings among you come they not
hence even of your lusts that war in your members   ye lust and
have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and
war yet ye have not because ye ask not
ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume
it upon your lusts
ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of
the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of
the world is the enemy of god
do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that
dwelleth in us lusteth to envy   but he giveth more grace
wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the
humble
submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will
flee from you
draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your
hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded
be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to
mourning and your joy to heaviness
humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you
up
speak not evil one of another brethren he that speaketh evil of
his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and
judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the
law but a judge
there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy who
art thou that judgest another   go to now ye that say to day or
to morrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and
buy and sell and get gain  whereas ye know not what shall be on
the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapour that appeareth
for a little time and then vanisheth away
for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do
this or that
but now ye rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil
therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to
him it is sin
go to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall
come upon you
your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten
your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a
witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire ye have
heaped treasure together for the last days
behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
fields which is of you kept back by fraud crieth and the cries of
them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of
sabaoth
ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton ye have
nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter
ye have condemned and killed the just and he doth not resist you
be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord
behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth
and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latter
rain
be ye also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of the
lord draweth nigh
grudge not one against another brethren lest ye be condemned
behold the judge standeth before the door
take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of
the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience
behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the
patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is
very pitiful and of tender mercy
but above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven
neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be
yea and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnation
is any among you afflicted let him pray is any merry let him
sing psalms
is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church
and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the
lord  and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord
shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be
forgiven him
confess your faults one to another and pray one for another
that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
availeth much
elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed
earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by
the space of three years and six months
and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth
brought forth her fruit
brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert
him  let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the
error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a
multitude of sins
the first epistle general of peter
peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered
throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia  elect
according to the foreknowledge of god the father through
sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the
blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which
according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively
hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead  to an
inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away
reserved in heaven for you  who are kept by the power of god
through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be
ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations  that the trial
of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth
though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour
and glory at the appearing of jesus christ  whom having not seen
ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice
with joy unspeakable and full of glory  receiving the end of your
faith even the salvation of your souls
of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you
searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which
was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings
of christ and the glory that should follow
unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us
they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them
that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down
from heaven which things the angels desire to look into
wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to
the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation
of jesus christ  as obedient children not fashioning yourselves
according to the former lusts in your ignorance  but as he which
hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation
because it is written be ye holy for i am holy
and if ye call on the father who without respect of persons
judgeth according to every mans work pass the time of your
sojourning here in fear  forasmuch as ye know that ye were not
redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain
conversation received by tradition from your fathers  but with
the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without
spot  who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the
world but was manifest in these last times for you  who by him
do believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him
glory that your faith and hope might be in god
seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through
the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one
another with a pure heart fervently  being born again not of
corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which
liveth and abideth for ever
for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower
of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away
but the word of the lord endureth for ever and this is the word
which by the gospel is preached unto you
wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies
and envies all evil speakings  as newborn babes desire the
sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby  if so be ye
have tasted that the lord is gracious
to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men
but chosen of god and precious  ye also as lively stones are
built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ
wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in
sion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on
him shall not be confounded
unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them
which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the
same is made the head of the corner  and a stone of stumbling and
a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being
disobedient whereunto also they were appointed
but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy
nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of
him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light
which in time past were not a people but are now the people of
god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy
dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain
from fleshly lusts which war against the soul  having your
conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak
against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they
shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation
submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake
whether it be to the king as supreme  or unto governors as unto
them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the
praise of them that do well
for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to
silence the ignorance of foolish men  as free and not using your
liberty for a cloke of maliciousness but as the servants of god
honour all men love the brotherhood fear god honour the king
servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to
the good and gentle but also to the froward
for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward god
endure grief suffering wrongfully
for what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye
shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it
ye take it patiently this is acceptable with god
for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered
for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps
who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth  who when
he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened
not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously  who
his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being
dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were
healed
for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the
shepherd and bishop of your souls
likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that
if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the
conversation of the wives  while they behold your chaste
conversation coupled with fear
whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the
hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel  but let
it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible
even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of
god of great price
for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who
trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own
husbands  even as sara obeyed abraham calling him lord whose
daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any
amazement
likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge
giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being
heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not
hindered
finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another
love as brethren be pitiful be courteous  not rendering evil for
evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that
ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing
for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain
his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile  let
him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it
for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are
open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that
do evil
and who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that
which is good   but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake
happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled
but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to
give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
is in you with meekness and fear  having a good conscience that
whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed
that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ
for it is better if the will of god be so that ye suffer for
well doing than for evil doing
for christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the
unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the
flesh but quickened by the spirit  by which also he went and
preached unto the spirits in prison  which sometime were
disobedient when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days of
noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls
were saved by water
the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not
the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good
conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ  who
is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and
authorities and powers being made subject unto him
forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm
yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in
the flesh hath ceased from sin  that he no longer should live the
rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of
god
for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the
will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess
of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries
wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same
excess of riot speaking evil of you  who shall give account to
him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead
for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are
dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but
live according to god in the spirit
but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and
watch unto prayer
and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for
charity shall cover the multitude of sins
use hospitality one to another without grudging
as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same
one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god
if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man
minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god
in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise
and dominion for ever and ever amen
beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is
to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you  but
rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christs sufferings that
when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding
joy
if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the
spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil
spoken of but on your part he is glorified
but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an
evildoer or as a busybody in other mens matters
yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but
let him glorify god on this behalf
for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that
obey not the gospel of god   and if the righteous scarcely be
saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear   wherefore
let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping
of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator
the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and
a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the
glory that shall be revealed  feed the flock of god which is among
you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly
not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind  neither as being lords
over gods heritage but being ensamples to the flock
and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown
of glory that fadeth not away
likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all
of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for
god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he
may exalt you in due time  casting all your care upon him for he
careth for you
be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a
roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour  whom
resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are
accomplished in your brethren that are in the world
but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal
glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you
perfect stablish strengthen settle you
to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen
by silvanus a faithful brother unto you as i suppose i have
written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace
of god wherein ye stand
the church that is at babylon elected together with you
saluteth you and so doth marcus my son
greet ye one another with a kiss of charity peace be with you
all that are in christ jesus amen
the second general epistle of peter
simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them
that have obtained like precious faith with us through the
righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ  grace and peace
be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our
lord  according as his divine power hath given unto us all things
that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him
that hath called us to glory and virtue  whereby are given unto us
exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be
partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is
in the world through lust
and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue
and to virtue knowledge  and to knowledge temperance and to
temperance patience and to patience godliness  and to godliness
brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity
for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye
shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord
jesus christ
but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar
off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins
wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your
calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never
fall  for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly
into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ
wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in
remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established
in the present truth
yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir
you up by putting you in remembrance  knowing that shortly i must
put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed
me
moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to
have these things always in remembrance
for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made
known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were
eyewitnesses of his majesty
for he received from god the father honour and glory when there
came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved
son in whom i am well pleased
and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with
him in the holy mount
we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well
that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until
the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts  knowing this
first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private
interpretation
for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but
holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost
but there were false prophets also among the people even as there
shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable
heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon
themselves swift destruction
and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the
way of truth shall be evil spoken of
and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not
and their damnation slumbereth not
for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down
to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved
unto judgment  and spared not the old world but saved noah the
eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon
the world of the ungodly  and turning the cities of sodom and
gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an
ensample unto those that after should live ungodly  and delivered
just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked  for
that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed
his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds  the
lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to
reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished  but
chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and
despise government presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not
afraid to speak evil of dignities
whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not
railing accusation against them before the lord
but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and
destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and
shall utterly perish in their own corruption  and shall receive
the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riot
in the day time spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves
with their own deceivings while they feast with you  having eyes
full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable
souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed
children  which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray
following the way of balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages of
unrighteousness  but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass
speaking with mans voice forbad the madness of the prophet
these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a
tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever
for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure
through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that
were clean escaped from them who live in error
while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants
of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he
brought in bondage
for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world
through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are
again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with
them than the beginning
for it had been better for them not to have known the way of
righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy
commandment delivered unto them
but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the
dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to
her wallowing in the mire
this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which
i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance  that ye may be
mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets
and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour
knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers
walking after their own lusts  and saying where is the promise of
his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as
they were from the beginning of the creation
for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god
the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and
in the water  whereby the world that then was being overflowed
with water perished  but the heavens and the earth which are
now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against
the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men
but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is
with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day
the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count
slackness but is longsuffering to usward not willing that any
should perish but that all should come to repentance
but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the
which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are
therein shall be burned up
seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner
of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness
looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the
heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt
with fervent heat   nevertheless we according to his promise
look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness
wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be
diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and
blameless
and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even
as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto
him hath written unto you  as also in all his epistles speaking
in them of these things in which are some things hard to be
understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they
do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction
ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware
lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from
your own stedfastness
but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour
jesus christ to him be glory both now and for ever amen
the first epistle general of john
that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we
have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have
handled of the word of life  for the life was manifested and we
have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life
which was with the father and was manifested unto us  that which
we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have
fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and
with his son jesus christ
and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full
this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare
unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all
if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness
we lie and do not the truth  but if we walk in the light as he
is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of
jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth
is not in us
if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his
word is not in us
my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin
not
and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ
the righteous  and he is the propitiation for our sins and not
for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world
and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his
commandments
he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a
liar and the truth is not in him
but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god
perfected hereby know we that we are in him
he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk
even as he walked
brethren i write no new commandment unto you but an old
commandment which ye had from the beginning the old commandment is
the word which ye have heard from the beginning
again a new commandment i write unto you which thing is true in
him and in you because the darkness is past and the true light now
shineth
he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in
darkness even until now
he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is
none occasion of stumbling in him
but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in
darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because that darkness hath
blinded his eyes
i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven
you for his names sake
i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from
the beginning i write unto you young men because ye have overcome
the wicked one i write unto you little children because ye have
known the father
i have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that
is from the beginning i have written unto you young men because ye
are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcome
the wicked one
love not the world neither the things that are in the world if
any man love the world the love of the father is not in him
for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust
of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of
the world
and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that
doeth the will of god abideth for ever
little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that
antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we
know that it is the last time
they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had
been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went
out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us
but ye have an unction from the holy one and ye know all things
i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but
because ye know it and that no lie is of the truth
who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ he is
antichrist that denieth the father and the son
whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father he that
acknowledgeth the son hath the father also
let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the
beginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain
in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father
and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal
life
these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce
you
but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you
and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing
teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as
it hath taught you ye shall abide in him
and now little children abide in him that when he shall
appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his
coming
if ye know that he is righteous ye know that every one that
doeth righteousness is born of him
behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that
we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us
not because it knew him not
beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear
what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be
like him for we shall see him as he is
and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even
as he is pure
whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is
the transgression of the law
and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in
him is no sin
whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not
seen him neither known him
little children let no man deceive you he that doeth
righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous
he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from
the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he
might destroy the works of the devil
whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed
remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god
in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the
devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he
that loveth not his brother
for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we
should love one another
not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother
and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his
brothers righteous
marvel not my brethren if the world hate you
we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love
the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death
whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no
murderer hath eternal life abiding in him
hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life
for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren
but whoso hath this worlds good and seeth his brother have
need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth
the love of god in him   my little children let us not love in
word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth
and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our
hearts before him
for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and
knoweth all things
beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence
toward god
and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his
commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
and this is his commandment that we should believe on the name
of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us
commandment
and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in
him
and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath
given us
beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether
they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the
world
hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth
that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god  and every spirit
that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of
god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that
it should come and even now already is it in the world
ye are of god little children and have overcome them because
greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world
they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the
world heareth them
we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of
god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit
of error
beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every
one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god
he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love
in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god
sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through
him
herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and
sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another
no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god
dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us
hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he
hath given us of his spirit
and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to
be the saviour of the world
whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god
dwelleth in him and he in god
and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god
is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him
herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the
day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world
there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear
because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in
love
we love him because he first loved us
if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar
for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love
god whom he hath not seen   and this commandment have we from
him that he who loveth god love his brother also
whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and
every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten
of him
by this we know that we love the children of god when we love
god and keep his commandments
for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and
his commandments are not grievous
for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is
the victory that overcometh the world even our faith
who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that
jesus is the son of god   this is he that came by water and blood
even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it
is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth
for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the
word and the holy ghost and these three are one
and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and
the water and the blood and these three agree in one
if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater
for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son
he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself
he that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he believeth
not the record that god gave of his son
and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life
and this life is in his son
he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of
god hath not life
these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of
the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that
ye may believe on the name of the son of god
and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask
any thing according to his will he heareth us  and if we know
that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions
that we desired of him
if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he
shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto
death there is a sin unto death i do not say that he shall pray for
it
all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death
we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that is
begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not
and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in
wickedness
and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an
understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him
that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and
eternal life
little children keep yourselves from idols amen
the second epistle general of john
the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in
the truth and not i only but also all they that have known the
truth  for the truths sake which dwelleth in us and shall be
with us for ever
grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and from
the lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love
i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truth
as we have received a commandment from the father
and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new
commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that
we love one another
and this is love that we walk after his commandments this is the
commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk
in it
for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not
that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an
antichrist
look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have
wrought but that we receive a full reward
whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of
christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he
hath both the father and the son
if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive
him not into your house neither bid him god speed  for he that
biddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds
having many things to write unto you i would not write with
paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face
that our joy may be full
the children of thy elect sister greet thee amen
the third epistle general of john
the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius whom i love in the truth
beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be
in health even as thy soul prospereth
for i rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of
the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth
i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth
beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
brethren and to strangers  which have borne witness of thy
charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey
after a godly sort thou shalt do well  because that for his
names sake they went forth taking nothing of the gentiles
we therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellowhelpers
to the truth
i wrote unto the church but diotrephes who loveth to have the
preeminence among them receiveth us not
wherefore if i come i will remember his deeds which he doeth
prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith
neither doth he himself receive the brethren and forbiddeth them that
would and casteth them out of the church
beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good
he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil hath not seen
god
demetrius hath good report of all men and of the truth itself
yea and we also bear record and ye know that our record is true
i had many things to write but i will not with ink and pen write
unto thee  but i trust i shall shortly see thee and we shall
speak face to face peace be to thee our friends salute thee greet
the friends by name
the general epistle of jude
jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them
that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ
and called  mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied
beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you
that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once
delivered unto the saints
for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of
old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of
our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our
lord jesus christ
i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this
how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt
afterward destroyed them that believed not
and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their
own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness
unto the judgment of the great day
even as sodom and gomorrha and the cities about them in like
manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange
flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of
eternal fire
likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise
dominion and speak evil of dignities
yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he
disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a
railing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee
but these speak evil of those things which they know not but
what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they
corrupt themselves
woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and ran
greedily after the error of balaam for reward and perished in the
gainsaying of core
these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with
you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water
carried about of winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruit
twice dead plucked up by the roots  raging waves of the sea
foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the
blackness of darkness for ever
and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these
saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints
to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly
among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have
spoken against him
these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts
and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having mens persons in
admiration because of advantage
but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of
the apostles of our lord jesus christ  how that they told you
there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their
own ungodly lusts
these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the
spirit
but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith
praying in the holy ghost  keep yourselves in the love of god
looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life
and of some have compassion making a difference  and others
save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment
spotted by the flesh
now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to
present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
joy  to the only wise god our saviour be glory and majesty
dominion and power both now and ever amen
the revelation of saint john the devine
the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to shew
unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent
and signified it by his angel unto his servant john  who bare
record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and
of all things that he saw
blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this
prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the
time is at hand
john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you
and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and
from the seven spirits which are before his throne  and from jesus
christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the
dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved
us and washed us from our sins in his own blood  and hath made us
kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and
dominion for ever and ever amen
behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and
they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
because of him even so amen
i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the
lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty
i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation
and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that
is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus
christ
i was in the spirit on the lords day and heard behind me a
great voice as of a trumpet  saying i am alpha and omega the
first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it
unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and unto
smyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto sardis and
unto philadelphia and unto laodicea
and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being
turned i saw seven golden candlesticks  and in the midst of the
seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a
garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden
girdle
his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow
and his eyes were as a flame of fire  and his feet like unto fine
brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of
many waters
and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth
went a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance was as the sun
shineth in his strength
and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his
right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the
last  i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive
for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death
write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are
and the things which shall be hereafter  the mystery of the seven
stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden
candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches
and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches
unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things saith
he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the
midst of the seven golden candlesticks  i know thy works and thy
labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are
evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are
not and hast found them liars  and hast borne and hast patience
and for my names sake hast laboured and hast not fainted
nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left
thy first love
remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do
the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will
remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent
but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the
nicolaitanes which i also hate
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of
life which is in the midst of the paradise of god
and unto the angel of the church in smyrna write these things
saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive  i know
thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i
know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but
are the synagogue of satan
fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the
devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye
shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i
will give thee a crown of life
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death
and to the angel of the church in pergamos write these things
saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges  i know thy
works and where thou dwellest even where satans seat is and thou
holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith even in those days
wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where
satan dwelleth
but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there
them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balac to cast a
stumblingblock before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed
unto idols and to commit fornication
so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
nicolaitanes which thing i hate
repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight
against them with the sword of my mouth
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden
manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name
written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it
and unto the angel of the church in thyatira write these things
saith the son of god who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and
his feet are like fine brass  i know thy works and charity and
service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to
be more than the first
notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou
sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to
teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat
things sacrificed unto idols
and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she
repented not
behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery
with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds
and i will kill her children with death and all the churches
shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and i
will give unto every one of you according to your works
but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as many as
have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan
as they speak i will put upon you none other burden
but that which ye have already hold fast till i come
and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him
will i give power over the nations  and he shall rule them with a
rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to
shivers even as i received of my father
and i will give him the morning star
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
churches
and unto the angel of the church in sardis write these things
saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i
know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead
be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are
ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god
remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold
fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come on
thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon
thee
thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their
garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy
he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment
and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will
confess his name before my father and before his angels
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
churches
and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things
saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david
he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man
openeth  i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open
door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and
hast kept my word and hast not denied my name
behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they
are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come
and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee
because thou hast kept the word of my patience i also will keep
thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world
to try them that dwell upon the earth
behold i come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no
man take thy crown
him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god
and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my
god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which
cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my
new name
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
churches
and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these
things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of
the creation of god  i know thy works that thou art neither cold
nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot
so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i
will spue thee out of my mouth
because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and
have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and
miserable and poor and blind and naked  i counsel thee to buy
of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white
raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy
nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that
thou mayest see
as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore
and repent
behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice
and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and
he with me
to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne
even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne
he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the
churches
after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and
the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with
me which said come up hither and i will shew thee things which must
be hereafter
and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set
in heaven and one sat on the throne
and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like
unto an emerald
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon
the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white
raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold
and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne
which are the seven spirits of god
and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal
and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four
beasts full of eyes before and behind
and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a
calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast
was like a flying eagle
and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they
were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying
holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to
come
and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that
sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever  the four and
twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship
him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the
throne saying  thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and
honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy
pleasure they are and were created
and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals
and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is
worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof   and no
man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open
the book neither to look thereon
and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to
read the book neither to look thereon
and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of
the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book
and to loose the seven seals thereof
and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four
beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been
slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits
of god sent forth into all the earth
and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that
sat upon the throne
and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and
twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them
harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of
saints
and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the
book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and hast
redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and
people and nation  and hast made us unto our god kings and
priests and we shall reign on the earth
and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about
the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was
ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands
saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive
power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory
and blessing
and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and
under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them
heard i saying blessing and honour and glory and power be unto
him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever
and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders
fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever
and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as
it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and
see
and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a
bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and
to conquer
and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast
say come and see
and there went out another horse that was red and power was given
to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they
should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword
and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast
say come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat
on him had a pair of balances in his hand
and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure
of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and
see thou hurt not the oil and the wine
and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the
fourth beast say come and see
and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on
him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto
them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with
hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth
and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the
souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the
testimony which they held  and they cried with a loud voice
saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and
avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth   and white
robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them
that they should rest yet for a little season until their
fellowservants also and their brethren that should be killed as they
were should be fulfilled
and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there
was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair
and the moon became as blood  and the stars of heaven fell unto
the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is
shaken of a mighty wind
and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together
and every mountain and island were moved out of their places
and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men
and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and
every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the
mountains  and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and
hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the
wrath of the lamb  for the great day of his wrath is come and
who shall be able to stand   and after these things i saw four
angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four
winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on
the sea nor on any tree
and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal
of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels
to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea  saying hurt
not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the
servants of our god in their foreheads
and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were
sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the
children of israel
of the tribe of juda were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of
reuben were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of gad were sealed
twelve thousand
of the tribe of aser were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of
nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of manasses were
sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of simeon were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe
of levi were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of issachar were
sealed twelve thousand
of the tribe of zabulon were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe
of joseph were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of benjamin were
sealed twelve thousand
after this i beheld and lo a great multitude which no man
could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues
stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white
robes and palms in their hands  and cried with a loud voice
saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto
the lamb
and all the angels stood round about the throne and about the
elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces
and worshipped god  saying amen blessing and glory and
wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might be unto
our god for ever and ever amen
and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these
which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they   and i
said unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they
which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and
made them white in the blood of the lamb
therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day
and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell
among them
they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall
the sun light on them nor any heat
for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them
and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shall
wipe away all tears from their eyes
and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in
heaven about the space of half an hour
and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them
were given seven trumpets
and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden
censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should
offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which
was before the throne
and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the
saints ascended up before god out of the angels hand
and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the
altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and
thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake
and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
themselves to sound
the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled
with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of
trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up
and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain
burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea
became blood  and the third part of the creatures which were in
the sea and had life died and the third part of the ships were
destroyed
and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from
heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of
the rivers and upon the fountains of waters  and the name of the
star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became
wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made
bitter
and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was
smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the
stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone
not for a third part of it and the night likewise
and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of
heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabiters of
the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three
angels which are yet to sound   and the fifth angel sounded and
i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the
key of the bottomless pit
and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of
the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were
darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit
and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto
them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of
the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those
men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads
and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that
they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the
torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man
and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and
shall desire to die and death shall flee from them
and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their
faces were as the faces of men
and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as
the teeth of lions
and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and
the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses
running to battle
and they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in
their tails and their power was to hurt men five months
and they had a king over them which is the angel of the
bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon but in the
greek tongue hath his name apollyon
one woe is past and behold there come two woes more hereafter
and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four
horns of the golden altar which is before god  saying to the
sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are
bound in the great river euphrates
and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour
and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men
and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred
thousand thousand and i heard the number of them
and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on
them having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone and
the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their
mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone
by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and
by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths
for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their
tails were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do
hurt
and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues
yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not
worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone
and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk  neither
repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their
fornication nor of their thefts
and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed
with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it
were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire  and he had in his
hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and
his left foot on the earth  and cried with a loud voice as when
a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their
voices
and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about
to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up
those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not
and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth
lifted up his hand to heaven  and sware by him that liveth for
ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are
and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the
things which are therein that there should be time no longer
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin
to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared
to his servants the prophets
and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and
said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the
angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth
and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little
book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make
thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
and i took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it
up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten
it my belly was bitter
and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many
peoples and nations and tongues and kings
and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel
stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and
them that worship therein
but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure
it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall
they tread under foot forty and two months
and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall
prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in
sackcloth
these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing
before the god of the earth
and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their
mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he
must in this manner be killed
these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of
their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and
to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will
and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that
ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and
shall overcome them and kill them
and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city
which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord was
crucified
and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall
see their dead bodies three days and an half and shall not suffer
their dead bodies to be put in graves
and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and
make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two
prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth
and after three days and an half the spirit of life from god
entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell
upon them which saw them
and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come
up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their
enemies beheld them
and the same hour was there a great earthquake and the tenth
part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven
thousand and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the god
of heaven
the second woe is past and behold the third woe cometh
quickly
and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in
heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of
our lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever and ever
and the four and twenty elders which sat before god on their
seats fell upon their faces and worshipped god  saying we
give thee thanks o lord god almighty which art and wast and art to
come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast
reigned
and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time
of the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest give
reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the saints and them
that fear thy name small and great and shouldest destroy them which
destroy the earth
and the temple of god was opened in heaven and there was seen
in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings and
voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail
and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with
the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of
twelve stars  and she being with child cried travailing in
birth and pained to be delivered
and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great
red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon
his heads
and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did
cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which
was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was
born
and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations
with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his
throne
and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place
prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two
hundred and threescore days
and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought
against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels  and
prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven
and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the
devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out
into the earth and his angels were cast out with him
and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come
salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of
his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which
accused them before our god day and night
and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word
of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death
therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to
the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down
unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a
short time
and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he
persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child
and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she
might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished
for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent
and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the
woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood
and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth
and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth
and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war
with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and
have the testimony of jesus christ
and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out
of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten
crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy
and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet
were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and
the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority
and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his
deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast
and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast
and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who
is able to make war with him   and there was given unto him a
mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto
him to continue forty and two months
and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme
his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to
overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues
and nations
and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names
are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the
foundation of the world
if any man have an ear let him hear
he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that
killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the
patience and the faith of the saints
and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he
had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon
and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him
and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the
first beast whose deadly wound was healed
and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down
from heaven on the earth in the sight of men  and deceiveth them
that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had
power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on
the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the
wound by a sword and did live
and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that
the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as
would not worship the image of the beast should be killed
and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free
and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their
foreheads  and that no man might buy or sell save he that had
the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name
here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number
of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six
hundred threescore and six
and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion and with
him an hundred forty and four thousand having his fathers name
written in their foreheads
and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and
as the voice of a great thunder and i heard the voice of harpers
harping with their harps  and they sung as it were a new song
before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no
man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand
which were redeemed from the earth
these are they which were not defiled with women for they are
virgins these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth
these were redeemed from among men being the firstfruits unto god and
to the lamb
and in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault
before the throne of god
and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the
everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to
every nation and kindred and tongue and people  saying with a
loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his
judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the
sea and the fountains of waters
and there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen is
fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the
wine of the wrath of her fornication
and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if
any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his
forehead or in his hand  the same shall drink of the wine of
the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of
his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in
the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb
and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever
and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his
image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name
here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the
commandments of god and the faith of jesus
and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write blessed
are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth yea saith the
spirit that they may rest from their labours and their works do
follow them
and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one
sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and
in his hand a sharp sickle
and another angel came out of the temple crying with a loud
voice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap
for the time is come for thee to reap for the harvest of the earth is
ripe
and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth
and the earth was reaped
and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he
also having a sharp sickle
and another angel came out from the altar which had power over
fire and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle
saying thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the
vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe
and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered
the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the
wrath of god
and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came
out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of a
thousand and six hundred furlongs
and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven
angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the
wrath of god
and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them
that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and
over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of
glass having the harps of god
and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song
of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works lord god
almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints
who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thou
only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for
thy judgments are made manifest
and after that i looked and behold the temple of the
tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened  and the seven
angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed in
pure and white linen and having their breasts girded with golden
girdles
and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven
golden vials full of the wrath of god who liveth for ever and ever
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and
from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple till the
seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled
and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven
angels go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon
the earth
and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and
there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark
of the beast and upon them which worshipped his image
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and it
became as the blood of a dead man and every living soul died in the
sea
and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and
fountains of waters and they became blood
and i heard the angel of the waters say thou art righteous o
lord which art and wast and shalt be because thou hast judged
thus
for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou
hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy
and i heard another out of the altar say even so lord god
almighty true and righteous are thy judgments
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and power
was given unto him to scorch men with fire
and men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of
god which hath power over these plagues and they repented not to
give him glory
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
beast and his kingdom was full of darkness and they gnawed their
tongues for pain  and blasphemed the god of heaven because of
their pains and their sores and repented not of their deeds
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the
kings of the east might be prepared
and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth
of the false prophet
for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go
forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather
them to the battle of that great day of god almighty
behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and
keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame
and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew
tongue armageddon
and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and
there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne
saying it is done
and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there
was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth
so mighty an earthquake and so great
and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities
of the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before god
to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath
and every island fled away and the mountains were not found
and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven every stone
about the weight of a talent and men blasphemed god because of the
plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great
and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials
and talked with me saying unto me come hither i will shew unto thee
the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters
with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the
inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her
fornication
so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i
saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of
blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns
and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and
decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup
in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication
and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the
great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth
and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and
with the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered
with great admiration
and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel i will
tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth
her which hath the seven heads and ten horns
the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out
of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on
the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of
life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that
was and is not and yet is
and here is the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven
mountains on which the woman sitteth
and there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and the
other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short
space
and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and
is of the seven and goeth into perdition
and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have
received no kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with
the beast
these have one mind and shall give their power and strength
unto the beast
these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome
them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are
with him are called and chosen and faithful
and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the
whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues
and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall
hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat
her flesh and burn her with fire
for god hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to
agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of god
shall be fulfilled
and the woman which thou sawest is that great city which
reigneth over the kings of the earth
and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven
having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory
and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the
great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils
and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and
hateful bird
for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication
with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the
abundance of her delicacies
and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her
my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive
not of her plagues
for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered
her iniquities
reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double
according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her
double
how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so
much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a
queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow
therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning
and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is
the lord god who judgeth her
and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and
lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when
they shall see the smoke of her burning  standing afar off for
the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city babylon
that mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come
and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her
for no man buyeth their merchandise any more  the merchandise of
gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen
and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner
vessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and of
brass and iron and marble  and cinnamon and odours and
ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and
wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves
and souls of men
and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from
thee and thou shalt find them no more at all
the merchants of these things which were made rich by her
shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing
and saying alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine
linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious
stones and pearls   for in one hour so great riches is come to
nought and every shipmaster and all the company in ships and
sailors and as many as trade by sea stood afar off  and cried
when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like unto
this great city   and they cast dust on their heads and cried
weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great city wherein were
made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness
for in one hour is she made desolate
rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and
prophets for god hath avenged you on her
and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and
cast it into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city
babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all
and the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and
trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman
of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee and the
sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee  and
the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the
voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all
in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy
sorceries were all nations deceived
and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and
of all that were slain upon the earth
and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in
heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honour and power
unto the lord our god  for true and righteous are his judgments
for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with
her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her
hand
and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up for ever and
ever
and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and
worshipped god that sat on the throne saying amen alleluia
and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all
ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great
and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the
voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying
alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth
let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the
marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready
and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen
clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints
and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called
unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are
the true sayings of god
and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see
thou do it not i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that have
the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the
spirit of prophecy
and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that
sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he
doth judge and make war
his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many
crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself
and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name
is called the word of god
and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white
horses clothed in fine linen white and clean
and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should
smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he
treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god
and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king
of kings and lord of lords
and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud
voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come
and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god
that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the
flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on
them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and
great
and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their
armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the
horse and against his army
and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that
wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had
received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image
these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone
and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon
the horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls
were filled with their flesh
and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand
and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the
devil and satan and bound him a thousand years  and cast him
into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him
that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years
should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season
and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given
unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the
witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not
worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark
upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned
with christ a thousand years
but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years
were finished this is the first resurrection
blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection
on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of
god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years
and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed
out of his prison  and shall go out to deceive the nations which
are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather them
together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea
and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the
camp of the saints about and the beloved city and fire came down
from god out of heaven and devoured them
and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be
tormented day and night for ever and ever
and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from
whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no
place for them
and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the
books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of
life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written
in the books according to their works
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and
hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged
every man according to their works
and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the
second death
and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
into the lake of fire
and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and
the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea
and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god
out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the
tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they
shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their
god
and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there
shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
there be any more pain for the former things are passed away
and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things
new
and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful
and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the
beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the
fountain of the water of life freely
he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his
god and he shall be my son
but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and
murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all
liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
brimstone which is the second death
and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me
saying come hither i will shew thee the bride the lambs wife
and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem
descending out of heaven from god  having the glory of god and
her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper
stone clear as crystal  and had a wall great and high and had
twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written
thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of
israel  on the east three gates on the north three gates on
the south three gates and on the west three gates
and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the
names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof
and the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the
breadth and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand
furlongs
the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal
and he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty and four
cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angel
and the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city
was pure gold like unto clear glass
and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with
all manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the
second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald
the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh
chrysolyte the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a
chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst
and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was
of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were
transparent glass
and i saw no temple therein for the lord god almighty and the
lamb are the temple of it
and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to
shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the
light thereof
and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light
of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into
it
and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there
shall be no night there
and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into
it
and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but
they which are written in the lambs book of life
and he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal
proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb
in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the
river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits
and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for
the healing of the nations
and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of
the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him  and
they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads
and there shall be no night there and they need no candle
neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they
shall reign for ever and ever
and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the
lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants
the things which must shortly be done
behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of
the prophecy of this book
and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard
and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which
shewed me these things
then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy
fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which
keep the sayings of this book worship god
and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
this book for the time is at hand
he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is
filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be
righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still
and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give
every man according as his work shall be
i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and
the last
blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have
right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the
city
for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and
murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie
i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in
the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright
and morning star
and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth
say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let
him take the water of life freely
for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god
shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book
and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this
prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and
out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book
he which testifieth these things saith surely i come quickly
amen
even so come lord jesus
the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
